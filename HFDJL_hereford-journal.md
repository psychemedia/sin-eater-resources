INDECOROUS CUSTOMS.

The irreverent practice properly condemned in the following extract from Southey's *Common-place Book*, has prevailed at assize-sermons in both Worcester and Hereford Cathedrals. If, when the beautiful edifice at the latter city shall be re-opened for Divine Service, the Bishop, or rather the Dean as the Ordinary, shall abate a nuisance which prevents all seriousness in the worship, general approval will follow ; there will be no fear that those who effect so desirable reform will incur the fate which is i spoken of in the following extract as threatened to Dr. i Lake:— 

"In the cathedral of York an indecent custom, not yet abolished in some other cathedrals, prevailed of walking and talking loudly in the nave during prayers, so that the congregation were often interrupted in their devotions. Dr. Lake, however, was a resolute disciplinarian, and resolved to break so indecent and profane usage; but the mob were so mnch exasperated by the attempt that, after breaking open the south door of the cathedral, they assaulted the residentiary his own house, and having stripped it of part of the tiles, would probably have murdered him had he not been seasonably rescued by Captain Honeywood, the deputy-governor of the castle."— Whittaker's *Loidis and Elmete*, p. 37.

To turn from Hereford Cathedral to the villages of the county, we heartily wish the practice of eating and drinking at funerals, described in the annexed extract, were abolished. The English loudly and justly condemn the frantic *wakes* of the Irish ; but is their own custom of eating dainty luncheons accompanied with Maderia and *liquers* to be commended? Lord Byron's satire is painfully true:

"There's deal of fun 
In mourning-coaches when the funeral's done."

In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funeralsto hire poor people who were to take upon them all the sins of the party deceased and were called 'sin-eaters.' One of them, I remember, lived in a cottage on the Ross highway. The manner was this: when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl (a gossip's bowl of maple) full of beerm which he was to drink up, with sixpence of money; in consequence, whereof, he took upon himself, *ipso facto*, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. In Noerth Wales the sin-eaters are frequently made use of; but there, instead of a nbowl of beer, they have a bowl of milk. This custom was by some people observed even in the strictest times of the Presbyterian government; and at Dyndar, *volens nolens* the parson of the parish, the relations of a woman deceased there had the ceremony performed punctually according to her will. The like was done in the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazar-bowl for the sin-eater; and in other places in this county, as also at Brecon, at Llangore, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder this superstition." — Aubrey of Gentilisme, MS., quoted Kennet's Par. Ant. ii. 276

To the practice last mentioned of giving to the poor at funerals, we have no objection, except the fear of the distribution of the doles not being made "decently and in order."

... THE CAMBRIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AT LUDLOW. The sixth annual meeting- of this valuable and useful Society commenced Ludlow on Monday, and the sitting-s, excursions, &c. were continued throughout the week, and closed on Saturday.

....


The Cambrian Archaeological Association

... 

FRIDAY. This morning party was formed to visit Leominster to inspect the Church, where Mr. Freeman explained the various parts which he had alluded to in his lecture the previous evening. After Leominster, Kingsland and Aymestrey Churches were next visited, and from thence the party proceeded to Wigmore Castle and Church, which excited no little admiration. The excursionists then resumed their seats, and returned to Ludlow, via Aston Church, where the Rev. J. Burleigh James, the respected local secretary, directed attention to the tympanum in the Norman arch.

Evening Meeting.— 
T. O. Morgan, Esq., of Aberystwith, read paper upon "The Parish of Carno, Montgomeryshire," which was followed by some remarks by the Rev. Basil Jones; after which W. Moggridge, Esq. delivered a very interesting discourse upon a custom which formerly existed in Wales, in connection with deceased persons, and which he had recently discovered was noticed in an old work, as being prevalent in the neighbourhood of Ross, in Herefordshire. The custom was this— when a party died, a person known by the name of "the sin-eater" was called in, who placed upon the corpse a platter containing a loaf of bread and some salt; the sin-eater afterwards ate the bread, and in doing so was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the deceased person. Happily, however, the light of a Christian age was rapidly banishing superstition from the minds of the people, and that custom had, he believed, now disappeared.

Thomas Allen, Esq. stated that there still existed custom in Wales of placing candle in salt, and burning it in the chamber of a deceased person, and made some very interesting remarks upon it, as connected with the custom of the sin-eater.

Miscellaneous Gleanings. 

Welsh Superstition.—

While on the subject of deaths, I must mention a singular superstitious custom which lingered, not very long ago, in some of the secluded mountain vales of Carmarthenshire. When person died, his friends sent for the sin-eater the district, who, for the small sum of half-a-crown, actually took upon himself the sins of the deceased, by the simple process of eating them. Tho plan of operation was this :—A loaf of bread was provided, which the sin-eater first placed upon the dead person's chest, then muttered some incantations over it, finally eating it. Will it be credited that he was believed to have taken from the defunct the heavy weight of his sins, and to appropriate them to himself, for which act of kindness he was regarded by everybody as a tabooed outcast! Indeed, immediately after the ceremony was finished, and he had received his pay, he vanished in double-quick time, it being the usual custom for the friends to belabour him with sticks—if they could catch him— Once a Week.
