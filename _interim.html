<h1>Interim - 1854-1870<a class="headerlink" href="#interim-1854-1870" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Following the publicaion of Moggridge’s comments in 1852, and the immediate response to it, I have found few mentions of the tradition until the 1870s.</p>
<p>In Thomas Roscoe’s <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/wanderingsandex01roscgoog/page/n80/mode/2up?q=obsolete"><em>Wanderings and excursions in South Wales, with the scenery of the River Wye</em></a> of 1854, we find at p48-51 a referernce to the tradition of corpse candles, the <em>Cwn Annwn</em> and the <em>Cyoewraeth</em>:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Corpse Candles (Roscoe citing <em>Mountain Decameron</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We are apt to marvel at accounts of odd ceremonies and customs in other lands, without knowing half the peculiar habits and ancient rites still practised within the boundaries of our own country ; many of which, especially among the Welsh, may be traced to the highest antiquity.
The familiar superstitions of Wales are becoming gradually fainter and fainter ; but it is notorious that in this county they were more rife than in almost any other in Wales, and that not only amongst the uneducated portion of its inhabitants, but including those who, from their rank in society, might have been considered superior to the delusions of their age. John Lewis, Esq., a magistrate, residing near Aberystwith, writing, in the year 1656, to a clergyman, relates several stories of apparitions, and the <em>Canwyll Corph</em>, or corpse candles, with a minuteness and simplicity which show his entire belief in his narratives. The Rev. John Davis, a minister, in Cardiganshire, has written down the order which seems to regulate this superstition : — “We call them” saith he, “corpse candles, not that we see anything besides the light, but yet it resembles a material candlelight, as much as eggs do eggs, only they sometimes appear and instantly disappear : for, if one comes near them, or on the way against them, unto him they vanish ; but presently appear behind him, and hold on their course. If it be a little candle, pale and bluish, then follows the corpse of an abortive, or some infant. If a big one, then the corpse of some one come to age. If two, three, or more, great and little, be seen together, then so many and such corpse will follow together. If two candles come from divers places, and be seen to meet, the corpse will do the like. If any of these candles seem to turn out of the way or path that leads to the church, the following corpse will be found to turn in some place, for the avoiding some dirty lane, plash, &amp;c.”</p>

<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><em>Cwn Annwn</em> (Roscoe citing <em>Mountain Decameron</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The author of the <em>Mountain Decameron</em> gives some graphic descriptions of several other popular superstitions, which I shall transcribe. “The superstitions of Wales form no part of the popular <em>poetry</em> of our age; yet there exist many grandly imaginative. How few know anything about our <em>Cwn Annwn,</em> [<em>Annwn</em>— the <em>bottomless abyss ; Hell</em>, in the ancient sense, as the “bourn” of all spirits.] that is, ‘Dogs of the sky,’ but which their office, as assigned, would warrant us to call the <em>Bloodhounds of Souls!</em> by earthly analogy. Sudden fires trail along the heavens at the moment of a dying person’s body and soul taking leave, and that light is no other than that fire which each of that terrible pack always has following after like a chain ; and sounds, like the yellings of an earthly hunt, may be heard in the dumbness of midnight, and which hunting is no less than the chase of the parting soul by these fiends of the sky, as it flies towards heaven’s gate before them, — the flight for nothing less than <em>eternal</em> life or death! What superstition affecting <em>mortal</em> life and its brevity, and its briefer pains, can compare in terror, in wildness, or sublimity with this ? With these howlings and huntings for immortal souls, these wildfires trailed by demon bloodhounds, across all the deep-blue <em>chase</em> of the midnight heavens, and the issue of this dread hunting never revealed to the mourner, upgazing from the gate of the house of mourning ?</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><em>Cyoewraeth</em> (Roscoe citing <em>Mountain Decameron</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“More terrible and forcible in mournful conception is the strange being that crosses the twilight path of the Welsh mountaineer, and which warns him by its mere presence, of a death in his house near at hand. The <em>Cyoewraeth</em> is the likeness of a woman, frightfully cadaverous of visage, bringing all the festering horror of a three weeks’ burial, in its grim yet not utterly disfeatured loathsomeness, abroad into the world of life, divulging the foulest secrets of the grave ! This <em>form</em> stands direct in some lonesome path of the startled person, tossing her long grisly arms in the air, and wringing her earthy lengths of wasted hand, and, shaking down her already worm-beset hair over her eye-holes, and their sunken dead-lights fixed upon his, steady as the basilisk’s on its prey, but gloomy, — sets up such a cry of wild weeping, and utters two words only, so terrible in their power, that they for the moment arrest the moving blood in the veins of the hearer — the Welsh words signifying ‘Oh, my wife !’ or, ‘Oh, my husband !’ according to the sex of the short-lived object of its fatal forewarning.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>At page 52-4, Roscoe also quotes the description of the sin-eater.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><em>Sin-eater</em> (Roscoe citing <em>Mountain Decameron</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“So late as the earlier part of the last century, that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of ‘The Sin-Eater,’ was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, who (unless we suppose him an unbeliever), being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did, for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confession during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his already laden soul.</p>
<p>“Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter which speaks of a ‘Sin-Eater,’ who ‘lived by Ross highway,’ and is described as a ‘gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal.’</p>
<p>“A gentleman, who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last ‘Sin-Eater of Wales’.</p>
<p>“‘I got lost,’ says he, ‘near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy bog, for no horse ever ventured among the peat-pits — the whole being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse.</p>
<p>“‘At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse’s hoof, and I saw a cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a distance. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office; that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever.’</p>
<p>“This is the traveller’s account of this incident. He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman’s long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road’s point the straw of her husband’s late bed — the usual signal of a death in the house.</p>
<p>“‘The Sin-Eater,’ he was told, ‘lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dare by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse.’”</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>In John Murray’s <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/ahandbookfortra07firgoog/page/n30/mode/2up?q=sin"><em>A handbook for travellers in South Wales and its borders, including the river Wye. With a travelling map</em></a> of 1860, we see prfatory comments on pp. <em>xxvi-xxvii</em> describing old traditions that appear to come from the <em>Archaeologia Cambrensis</em> report of the 1852 meeting at Ludlow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Many old customs and superstitions have become obsolete within the last ten or twenty years, in consequence of increased education and facilities of intercommunication with the rest of the country. Some of them may be mentioned as both interesting and curious. The superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm Amman in Carmarthenshire. When a person died, the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the deceased, and on the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally eat, thereby eating the sins of the dead person. This done, he received the fee of 2s. 6d., and vanished as quickly as he could, the friends helping his departure by the aid of sundry blows and kicks, if they could catch him ; for as it was believed that he took upon himself the sins of the defunct, he was looked upon as a social Pariah for whom nothing was too bad. The custom of placing bread or a plate of salt on the breast of the corpse is by no means uncommon in many parts of Wales.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the first mention of <em>“the friends helping his departure by the aid of sundry blows and kicks, if they could catch him “</em> that I recall?</p>
<p>Another curious custom is still in existence — that of the Cefyl Pren, which occurs in cases where popular indignation is excited by any gross infringement of domestic rights or proprieties. A large crowd, one of whom is dressed up with a horse’s head, assembles before the door of the delinquent, who, after undergoing an immense amount of vituperation and a hideous noise of old kettles and cleavers, is at length burnt in effigy, by which the sacred wrath of the people is at length appeased.</p>
<p>In the press, the story continued to appear in various articles recalling customs and traditions. For example, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001467/18621210/017/0002">December 12th, 1962</a> edition of <em>Eddowes’s Journal, and General Advertiser for Shropshire, and the Principality of Wales</em> describes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Welsh Superstition.— While on the subject of deaths, I must mention singular superstitious custom which lingered, not very long ago, in some of the secluded mountain-vales of Carmarthenshire. When person died his friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who, for the small sum of half a crown, actually took upon himself the sins of the deceased, by the simple process of eating them. The plan of operation was this :— A loaf of bread was provided, which the sin-eater first placed upon the dead person’s chest, then muttered some incantations over it, finally eating it. Will it be credited that he was believed to have taken from the defunct the heavy weight of his sins, and to appropriate them to himself, for which act of kindness he was regarded by everybody as a tabooed outcast? Indeed, immediately after the ceremony was finished, and had received his pay, he vanished in double quick time, it being usual custom for the friends to belabour him with sticks-if they could catch him.— <em>Once a Week</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Again, we have the mention of that one the sin-eater <em>had received his pay, he vanished in double quick time, it being usual custom for the friends to belabour him with sticks-if they could catch him</em>.</p>
<div class="seealso admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">“Once a Week”</p>
<p>The reference to <em>Once a Week</em> seems to be a reference to a column in another publication. But which one?</p>
</div>
<p>The same tale, similarly credited, also appears on page 3 of <em>The Welshman</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4351919/4351922/10/"></a> dated December 12th, 1862, and in the <em>Hereford Journal</em> on the same date.</p>
