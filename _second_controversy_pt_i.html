<p>Following the report in <em>The Times</em> of Captain Hinde’s paper “On Cannibalism” presented to <em>Section H - Anthropology</em> at the <em>Sixty-fifth Meeting of The British Association</em> at Ipswich, September, 1895, a letter to the editor appeared in the issue of Wednesday, September 18th, 1895, from a certain Mr. N. W. Thomas, of Oswestry, taking issue the remarks made by E. Sidney Hartland reported therefrom.</p>
<p>Let’s review what Hartland was reported by the <em>Times</em> as saying:</p>
<div class="admonition-mr-e-s-hartland-responding-to-captain-hinde admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Mr E. S.Hartland responding to Captain Hinde</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mr. E. S. HARTLAND said that in all probability the earliest form of cannibalism was that of the eating of deceased relatives. This practice extended over bhe greater part of the world, and many people would be surprised to learn that traces of it were to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own islands. Not very long ago in Upper Bavaria, when a man died and had been laid out, a cake was made of ordinary flour. The corpse was placed before the fire, and this cake, called the corpse cake, was put upon its breast to rise. The dough, in rising, was believed to absorb all the virtues of the deceased, and the cake was afterwards eaten by his nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peniusula an edible image of the dead was carried in the funeral procession. When the body was buried the mourners ate this image above the grave, saying as they did so, “God rest him.” In Wales the practice of employing a “sin-eater” had only ceased within the memory of men still living. It was the custom for the nearest relative, usually a woman, to hand across the bier, or place upon the breast of the corpse, bread, cheese, and beer, which were eaten by the sin-eater, who pronounced everlasting rest to the departed. It was believed that the sin-eater by this means appropriated to himself all the sins which the deceased had committed during his lifetime.</p>

<div><p>THE SIN EATER IN WALES.</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In your issue of Monday Mr. E. S. Hartland is reported to have said, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism in the Anthropological Section of the British Association, that the sin-eater has only disappeared from Wales within living memory.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Since he appears to be familiar with Hartland’s peice in <em>Folklore</em>, he assumes that material provides the evidence for Harltand’s claims made at the British Association meeting:</p>

<div><p>If, as I imagine, Mr. Hartland’s evidence for this survival is presented to us in his article on the subject in Folklore for June, 1892, I venture to think it is wholly insufficiant. Mr. Hartland’s words are (p. 148), ” Mr. Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie… as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period.” These words are a paraphrase from the report of the Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol. III., N.S., p. 330. The exact words used by Mr. Moggridge are as follows :-’ There (near Llandebie) the above practice (of the sin-eater) was said to have prevailed to a recent period. “</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And with this evidence, he takes issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This evidence is originally at best second hand; it is unfortunate that Mr. Hartland has emphasized its value; in the article in Folklore, Mr. Moggridge’s evidence has the appearance of beiug the result of personal observation. Thuw at the outset Mr. Hartland’s evidence is weakened.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To aid the reader, Thomas points to the evidence previously amassed against the claimed tradition in the course of the first controversy:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But to any one who has considered the discussion in the Academy in the winter of 1870-76 it seems quite incredible that Mr. Moggridge’s evidence should be quoted at all. Canon Silvan Evans collected the evidence on the question. Among others, the vicar of the parish and the schoolmaster testified to the non-existence of the superstition. The vicar quoted an intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in the parish. He said that such a custorm, in his opinion, could not have appeared for the last 200 years, or he would have heard of it from his father or grandfather, who lived to a great age. The vicar concluded that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge could not be substantiated by any reliable evidence.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster, Mr. John Rowland, who lived in Llandebie in 1852, when Mr. Moggridge spoke, was equally emphatic. He said he knew all the parishioners and the history of the parish, its customs, legends, and traditions, and during the time he was there he attended many funerals, but never heard of a sin-eater ; in fact, people never gave cakes at funerals in Llandebie.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thomas then wonders if Hartland may be unaware of that earlier controversy, but I wonder, is his tone curious, or incredulous?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Is it possible that Mr. Hartland has never seen this discussion, or has he ignored it ? In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to assert that the sin-eater was known within living memory in the locality named.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p id="index-4">Mr Thomas then refers to a letter from a <em>Rev. T. Eynon Davies</em> in 1882 to <em>Christian World</em>, apparently debunking Paxtod Hood’s description of the sin-eater:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In addition to this, in February, 1882, the Rev. T. Eynon Davies published a letter in the Christian World a propos of Paxton Hood’s “Christmas Evans.” Mr. Davies was Congregational minister in Cwmannan, near Llandebie, and said, “Some octogenarians whom I have questioned have never seen a sin-eater, neither have they heard their parents nor their grandparents refer to this custom.” There is, in fact, no evidence that he ever existed in Wales at all. All the stories go back to Aubrey’s “lean, long, ugly, lamentable,poor Raskel “; and he was at Ross, in Herefordshire, if we believe Aubrey, none too strong a witness.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>I have still to track down a copy of the full letter to Christian World.</em></p>
<p>We then have a phrase very evocative of our own times — “false news” — lamenting that it may be understandable in the press, but not in the pages of an amateru (which is to say, professional) society.</p>
<blockquote id="index-5">
<div><p>If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the ” sin-eater ” in modern times, stamped originally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, sealed 30 years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association.

<blockquote>

<p>The Attorney General and Miss Webster yesterday performed the ceremony of opening the pier and pier pavilion in Sandown Bay. The pier has been lengthened by 545ft., with a pier-head 107ft. by 93ft., and a pavilion has been built capable of accommodating 400 people, at a total cost of about £12,800.

<p>The following day, in the <em>Times</em> of Friday, September 20th, 1895, p7, one reader doubts the claims surrounding the sin-eating practice, but swiftly goes on to provide an example of another peculiar funeral custom:</p>

<p>Mr. Elton B.

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Amid the hurry of the concluding meetings of the British Association I did not see Mr. Thomas’s letter in your issue of Wednesday last; and it is only to-day that I have had an opportunity of reading it. I am much obliged to him for calling my attention to the fact that the existence of the sin-eater in Wales has been questioned.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then wonders why Mr. Thomas did not contribute to the correspondence around his (Hartland’s) article in <em>Folklore</em> and raise his concerns in a more timely fashion there:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I gather that he is a reader of Folklore.

<div><p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>With reference to the Welsh superstition of the sin-eater, the existence of which is doubted by Mr. Ede, those interested in the question may like to know that a full account of the superstition is given in “The Mountain Decameron,” by Joseph Downes, a now very rare book, published by Bentley in 1836, in three volumes.</p>
<p>On page 232 of vol. 3 there is the following heading - “The Last Sin-Eater of Wales, a Sketch,” &amp;c.</p>
<p>The chapter that follows is most interesting and minute, and seemns to be a literal transcript of fact. It is not strange, however, that the oldest inhabitant now living should not have heard of “the sin-eater,” since Joseph Downe, writing in 1836, himself says in the sentence introductory to his sketch, “So late an the earlier part of the last century that strange character of a stranger superstition known by the name of ‘the sin-eater’ was not unknown in Wales.”</p>
<p>What follows is an account in quotation marks of “what is believed to be the last sin-eater in Wales,” taken apparently from the printed work of some traveller whom Downes does not name. It is too long for quotation, but should be read by any one interested in the subject, as details of place and incident are so vivid that the traveller’s experience can scarcely be doubted. I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>
<p>Z.</p>

<p>During the original controversy, the readers of <em>Bye-Gones</em> were kept informed about the debate as it progressed, and with the opening salvos fired, it seems that a similar editorial line kicked in again.

The column reprinted the review in <em>The Times</em> of Mr Hartland’s comments made during the discussion following Captain Hinde’s paper, Mr Thomas’ letter taking issue with those comments, and Mr Hartand’s reply. Mr Thomas’ letter was followed by the following comment:</p>

As my statement at the British Association, and, indeed, the possession by Wales of this curious and important relic of the past at any recent period (or at all, if I understand him: rightly), has been challenged by a gentleman who writes in the “Times,” “Gwynfardd Dyfed” will confer an obligation on me and on all students of Welsh antiquities if he will kindly give in your paper a reference to the work from which he quotes (including exact title, page, date, and place of publication), and also state his authority for the survival of the custom in Cwmamman to 1881, for it seems to me that this was denied in 1882 by the Rev.

<p>LETTER FROM “GWYNFARDD DYFED.”</p>
<p>In reply to Mr. E. Sidney Hartland’s letter on this subject which appeared in our issue of September 25 last, “Gwynfardd Dyfedd” writes:– “I regret that, owing to my having been in a weak state of health recently, I have been unable before to give Mr. Hartland the additional information which he requires in support of the statements adduced in my article on the sin-eater in Wales.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then gives his sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It gives me much pleasure to find that Mr. Hartland was greatly interested in my contribution to the scanty literature on the subject of the alleged prevalence in bygone days of this sin-eating custom in the Principality and on its borders. Students of Welsh antiquities may like to know that the works quoted from by me on the subject are as under:— Pp. 52, 53, and 54 of ‘Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales: With the Scenery of the River Wye,’ by Thomas Roscoe, Esquire, published in 1854 by Mr. Henry G. Bohn. York-street, Covent Garden;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That reference, relating to Fosbroke, actual points to the <em>Mountain Decameron</em> in the original.</p>
<p>Gwynfardd Dyfed also cites <em>Cymru Fu</em>, the Welsh version of *Notes &amp; Queries, which in turn sourced material from Paxton Hood and Blackwood’s Magazine of 1875:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>also pp. 92 and 166 of Part II, of ‘Cymru Fu - Notes and Queries Relating to the Past History of Wales and Border Counties,’ published in 1888 by Messrs. Daniel Owen and Co. (Limited), of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In these notes in “Cymru Fu” the writers on this subject in turn draw their information from Paxton Hood’s Christmas Evans, and from ‘Blackwood’ (November, 1875). By consulting those sources as well, Mr. Hartland may come across more matter relating to this curious and superstitious custom, now obsolete. Possibly, do thorough investigation of the matter would result in much more about it being brought to light. If a few of the oldest people in the neighbourhood of Cwmamman, in Glamorganshire, were interviewed, surely some folk-lore respecting the sin-eater might be obtained.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also contributes personal experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I have talked to several old Pembrokeshire folk about the practice, but they appear to know nothing of such a custom; they, however, tell me that the plate of salt is still used in a great many eases. This, too, has come within my own personal experience. It is a pewter plate that is mostly used, if one such can be got. One old lady, now deceased, used to keep a pewter plate which she was in the habit of lending out for the purpose. It was also customary in the same county to place coins upon the eyelids of oorpses to keep their eyes closed. Are the coins and the plate of salt all mere relies of the sin-eating custom, or does their use possess any real efficacy? This important question is one which the medical man could assist the antiquary by answering.”</p>

<p>Since his earlier letter, he seems to have obtained copies of the arguments raised in the earlier controversy :</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>Letter to the Editor, <em>The Times</em>, E. S. Hartland, Monday, October 14th, 1895</p>
</aside>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THE SIN EATER IN WALES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,</p>
<p>Your correspondent, Mr. N. W. Thomas, denies the existence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the Academy of 20 years ago and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the Christian World of February, 1882. By the courtesy of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Woodall I have now been furnished with the correspondence containing these statements.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hartland opens with a defense of his claims as to the existence of the sin-eater, beginning with Aubrey:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I will deal with the negative evidence presently. Let us first see what positive evidence of the existence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr. Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey. This is true, in the sense that Aubrey is the earliest writer to mention the custom and that he gives the fullest account of it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He does not understand what Mr. Thomas’ issues are with such a notable source:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I do not know what grounds Mr. Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey’s testimony. He was a careful and enlightened inquirer into old customs.; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open ; his bona fides is not to be questioned ; and his description of the ceremony and the expressions he makes use of testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statement than casual gossip. He gives specific instances of sin-eating, not merely at Ross, as Mr. Thomas says, but also at Dynder, at Hereford, and at Llangors, in Brecknockshire, with particulars as to each. He does not, indeed, profess to have himself witnessed these instances.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, that Aubrey’s reports were not all his own direct testimony should not detract from their value:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That said, Aubrey <em>did</em> appear to have been witness to certain events he described:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But he does seem to have witnessed it, or a ceremony similar to it in all points except the utterance of the ritual words, at Beaumaris or elsewhere in North Wales. Speaking of offertories at funerals he says (“Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme” page 23) :-” These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye Ch. of Engl. Comon-Prayer-booke: but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingraved on it, &amp; ye parties name deceased, wch one accepts of on the other side of ye corps ; and this custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe he didn’t…</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Whether we are to understand that Aubrey saw this himself or not, it is clear that he had made minute inquiries.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Pennant is then evoked as another source:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A century later Pennant describes the same custom (“Tours in Wales,” ed. 1783, Vol. III., page 150). Pennant was born and lived in Wales ; and we must suppoose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours and friends, if he had not himself witnessed it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hartland is also able to draw on <em>contemporary</em> evidence that turned up in the pages of <em>Folklore</em> following the publication of his paper there in 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Coming down, to a more recent date, Miss Gertrude Hope,writing in Folklore (Vol. IV., page 392), describes the same ceremony as performed at Market Drayton as lately as the 1st of July, 1893. The details were given to her by an eye-witness, and she significantly adds - ” The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also claims to know of other Shropshire examples, although does not describe them, before drawing on another recent publication for evidence of related traditions elsewhere in England:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If necessary, I could give other cases from Shropshire ; and I ought not to leave quite unmentioned the superstition still current in Derbyshire, among a population probably still to a large extent of Celtic ancestry, that every drop of wine drank at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, in accordance with which belief wine is handed round first to the bearers and afterwards to the guests (see S. O. Addy, “Household Tales,” 1895, pages 123, 124). Mr. Thomas may, however, deny the relevancy of these; and considerations of space prevent my arguing the question at length here.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then summarises his defence:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Confining myself, therefore, to Wales, I observe that we have explicit assertions, not merely by Aubrey, but also by Pennant, as well as the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr. Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie down to a few years before 1852, when his paper was written. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us, found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited ; but in deference to them it is probable that in many places a compromise would be adopted. The acts would be retained, the words interpreting and completing them would be dropped.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hartland then enumerates what he considers to be Mr Thomas’ counter-claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now, what is the negative evidence ? It amounts to this :-</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Canon Silvan Evans, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folklore, never found a trace of the custom, nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature.</p></li>
<li><p>He made inquiries of the vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr. Rowland, the schoolmaster, denied the existence of the practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish of whom the vicar inquired also denied it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rev. T. Eynon Davies also denied it in reference to Cwmammman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the statements of octogenarians.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He is not convinced:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>None of these denials can outweigh the positive statements already cited. The custom certainly existed entire in the 17th century at Llangors. Shorn of the ritual words, it maintained itself into the 18th century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembrokeshire. We may be sure it did not maintain itself ony in these places, especially having regard to the practices in Market Drayton and in Derbyshire.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also goes on the offensive, casting doubt on Silvan Evans’ ability to reliably deny events at LLandebie that had occurred so many years previously:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans’s inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeel, was, we are told, an old resident; but the clergyman had only been vicar for 14 years, though he described himself as having known the neighbourhood well for 25 years, which may mean much or little.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also casts aspersions on the methods that may have been used when gathering counter-claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And suggests that the people doing the investigating would undoubtedly have been lied to or deliberately misled:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In any case they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition, if it existed. The Rev. Elias Owen, Diocesan Inspector of Schools and one of the chief authorities on Welsh folklore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitions of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse ” Our people are not superstitious, I am glad to say.” His inspection over, he asked the first class ” Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a buggan (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of any one who has seen one ? ” Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is the people hide their superstitions from all such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommon experience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev. C. F. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel “witch-burning” case, is express, and is of the greatest weight on this point. The reason of the concealment comes out in his evidence. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages as the priest or the minister to the ancient superstitions.</p>

</div>
<p>Silvan Evans’ claims are thus brushed away with a swipe of the hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>On the whole, then, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognized by every one), his denials and the results of his inquiries do not countervail the positive evidence of the existence of the sin-eater in Wales - and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev. Eynon Davies, whose inquiries were made later still.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Whilst Hartland’s evidence is all pure fact, and provided without more elaborate justification or reasonong, which could certainly provided given Hartland’s “scientific” approach, presumably:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I have confined myself to the bare question of fact, and have given little more than an outline of the arguments which I could adduce if I had space for them.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then refers to the book he published the previous year, in which we might recall Hartland had indulged in a certain amount of cannibal fetishism, and suggests that that work provides even more support for his claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The rite is discussed at length in the second volume of my “Legend of Perseus,” just published by Mr. David Nutt. Could I have advanced here the considerations there brought forward, I venture to think they would have strongly supported my conclusion.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hartland closes with an <em>ad hominem</em> attack that Thomas is perhaps acting from a sense of Welsh nationalistic fanaticism just as the Irish are wont to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I fear that, consciously or unconsciously, the denial has its roots in a mistaken national or local patriotism, which perhaps peeps forth in Mr. Thomas’s vehemence and in his allusion to the “Celtic fringe.” We are accustomed to this sort of thing among the Irish, who so greatly resent Giraldus Cambrensis’s account of their forefathers (in the main, I believe, perfectly true) that they call any daring lie “a Giraldus.” It is fair, however, to Canon Silvan Evans to say that he entirely disclaims this very natural feeling, putting the question purely as one of alleged matter of fact.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But just to be clear, Hartland is, of course, not a racist!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>My own numerous Welsh friends will not suspect me of any antipathy to their nation. or any desire to wound their susceptibilities in declining to accept Mr. Thomas’s verdict. I regard the sin-eater only as an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity ; and the last thing I should dream of would be to malke its possession the basis of any imputation against Wales or the Welsh.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Finally, Hartland explains any omissions in his account that draw on the <em>Mountain Decameron</em>, as referenced by that other letter of challenge to <em>The Times</em> penned by the pseudonymous <em>Z.</em>, as well as the correspondent Gwynfardd Dyfed writing to the Western Mail, taking the position that he hasn’t seen it, cannot count on its validity, but whatever it claims, he is sure he can work it into his account:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I have written without reference to the account in The Mountain Decameron mentiuned by your correspondent “Z,” because I have not seen that book. It is probably the nameless authority recently cited by a contributor to the Western Mail. If so,and if the account be authentic (as to which I can offer no opinion), the performance of the ceremony at night, as there described, would explain why the custom in some places eluded clerical notice.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And with that, he signs off:</p>
<blockquote>

<div><p>THE “SIN-EATER” IN WALES</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE WESTERN MAIL.</p>
<p>Sir-</p>
<p>A natural interest in the place of my birth prompts me to ask you to give the death-blow, once for all, to the absurd figment which I find reproduced in the “Western Mail” of this morning viz., that “the superstition of the ‘sin-eater’ lingered even till 1881 in the secluded Vale of Cwmamman, in Carmarthenshire.” When the late Mr. Paxton Hood first gave currency to the report in his “Life of Christmas Evans”, I, as well as others, asked some of the oldest reesidents of the place, whose memory reached back over 70 years, as to the truth of it, and they had never heard of the custom, which was said to prevail in their midst up to 1881. The late Dr. Rees, of Swansea, also naturally concerned that such a barbarous custom should be said to be practised by his countrymen towards the end of the nineteenth century, made the same inquiries, with the same result. I am not claiming for the secluded place of my birth an undue degree of enlightenment in asking you to “scotch ” if it be hopeless to destroy entirely, the absurd idea which would place it on a level with the most heathenish villages of Central Africa. -I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The editor, perhaps a little more circumspect, responded by way of an editorial comment at <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4333385/4333389/37/">p4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Editorial Comments</p>
<p>Quite a serious controversy has been waged in our columns, as well as those of the “Times,” on the subject of the “Sin-eater” in Wales. The function of this individual is alleged to have been to attend funerals and consume the sins of the defunct with cakes, washed down with nut-brown ale. It is alleged that sin-eating took place as late as 1852 at the village of Llandebie, in Carmarthenshire. The matter was investigated by Silvan Evans, the lexicographer, as well as the late “Giraldus” (who was resident there at the very time), and who but failed to discover any foundation for the story. Still, the evidence for the “Sin-eater” is not thus wholly got rid of, and equally extraordinary superstitions are to be met with in England and in other countries, so that no stone can reasonably be thrown at the Celt even if he did indulge these barbarous exercises, relics as they are of a dark and credulous age.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Llangollen Advertiser Denbighshire Merionethshire and North Wales Journal</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3173530/3173537/28/sin%20eater">October 18th, 1895</a>, p7, the sentiments raised by the issue are acknowledged:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>JOTTINGS AND GLEANINGS</p>
<p>SOME heat has been engendered over the question whether the picturesque profession of the sin-eater ever had any real existence in Wales or is the creation of the antiquarian imagination. It is asserted by students of folk-lore that a custom prevailed according to which the friends of a deceased man either themselves ate food passed over his body or engaged a substitute to do so in their behalf, the belief being that the sins of the dead were in this manner transferred to the living persons who took part in the ceremony. Mr. Sidney Hartland and other authorities contend that the account given of this superstition by Aubrey, a seventeenth century writer, can be confirmed not only from the pages of Pennant but from a considerable mass of more recent evidence.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Hartland’s case, however, is considered far from compelling:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It must be confessed that the instances adduced by Mr. Hartland in his letter on the subject are hardly convincing. A few isolated cases of curious ceremonies in dispensing the cold meats and strong liquors provided at burials prove nothing except that funeral etiquette varies according to localities. Mr. Hartland admits that there are no modern instances of ritual words being used, so that the significance of the rites can only be inferred from the interpretation supplied by Aubrey, which may be conjectural.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The observer also refers to another antique Welsh text, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.library.wales/digital-exhibitions-space/digital-exhibitions/europeana-rise-of-literacy/poetry-volumes/cannwyll-y-cymry/#?c=&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;cv=&amp;xywh=-886%2C0%2C3987%2C3390"><em>Cannwyll y Cymry</em></a> by Rhys Prichard, published posthunously in 1681, that fails to mention the ritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There is no reference to the alleged superstition, so far as we know, in Vicar Prichard’s “Canwyll y Cymru,” though he severely condemns a number of magical practices.</p>

</div>
<p>The lack of evidence turned up by Silvan Evans is also remarked on, before a wry suggestion that the sin-eater is perhaps of more interest in the chase than the actuality:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Canon Silvan Evans, with a considerable experience of funeral and a learned interest in folk-lore, never came across any vestige of the custom, and other competent investigators have likewise failed. In the interest of romance it is to be hoped that the sin-eater will not turn out so disappointing as the famous inscription discovered by Mr. Pickwick, which proved, on fuller inquiry, to be nothing more than “Bill Stumps His Mark,” but his reality is clearly not yet established.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Chapter 11, he inscription discovered</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Mr. Pickwick made that immortal discovery, which has been the pride and boast of his friends, and the envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country. They had passed the door of their inn, and walked a little way down the village, before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood. As they turned back, Mr. Pickwick’s eye fell upon a small broken stone, partially buried in the ground, in front of a cottage door. He paused.</p>
<p>‘This is very strange,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>‘What is strange?’ inquired Mr. Tupman, staring eagerly at every object near him, but the right one. ‘God bless me, what’s the matter?’</p>
<p>This last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment, occasioned by seeing Mr. Pickwick, in his enthusiasm for discovery, fall on his knees before the little stone, and commence wiping the dust off it with his pocket–handkerchief.</p>
<p>‘There is an inscription here,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>‘Is it possible?’ said Mr. Tupman.</p>
<p>‘I can discern,‘continued Mr. Pickwick, rubbing away with all his might, and gazing intently through his spectacles—‘I can discern a cross, and a 13, and then a T. This is important,’ continued Mr. Pickwick, starting up. ‘This is some very old inscription, existing perhaps long before the ancient alms–houses in this place. It must not be lost.’</p>
<p>He tapped at the cottage door. A labouring man opened it.</p>
<p>‘Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?’ inquired the benevolent Mr. Pickwick.</p>
<p>‘No, I doan’t, Sir,’ replied the man civilly. ‘It was here long afore I was born, or any on us.’</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.</p>
<p>‘You—you—are not particularly attached to it, I dare say,’ said Mr. Pickwick, trembling with anxiety. ‘You wouldn’t mind selling it, now?’</p>
<p>‘Ah! but who’d buy it?’ inquired the man, with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning.</p>
<p>‘I’ll give you ten shillings for it, at once,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘if you would take it up for me.’</p>
<p>The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined, when (the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade) Mr. Pickwick, by dint of great personal exertion, bore it with his own hands to the inn, and after having carefully washed it, deposited it on the table.</p>
<p>The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds, when their patience and assiduity, their washing and scraping, were crowned with success. The stone was uneven and broken, and the letters were straggling and irregular, but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered:—</p>

Mr. Pickwick’s eyes sparkled with delight, as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered. He had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition. In a county known to abound in the remains of the early ages; in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time, he—he, the chairman of the Pickwick Club—had discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity, which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him. He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses.</p>
<p>‘This—this,’ said he, ‘determines me. We return to town to–morrow.’</p>
<p>‘To–morrow!’ exclaimed his admiring followers.</p>
<p>‘To–morrow,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘This treasure must be at once deposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood. I have another reason for this step. In a few days, an election is to take place for the borough of Eatanswill, at which Mr. Perker, a gentleman whom I lately met, is the agent of one of the candidates. We will behold, and minutely examine, a scene so interesting to every Englishman.’</p>
<p>‘We will,’ was the animated cry of three voices.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickwick looked round him. The attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him. He was their leader, and he felt it.</p>
<p>‘Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,’ said he. This proposition, like the other, was received with unanimous applause. Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box, purchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placed himself in an arm–chair, at the head of the table; and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers: the inscription decoded</p>
<p>Mr. Blotton, indeed—and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime—Mr. Blotton, we say, with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds, presumed to state a view of the case, as degrading as ridiculous. Mr. Blotton, with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick, actually undertook a journey to Cobham in person, and on his return, sarcastically observed in an oration at the club, that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased; that the man presumed the stone to be ancient, but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription—inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood, and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than the simple construction of—‘Bill Stumps, his mark’; and that Mr. Stumps, being little in the habit of original composition, and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of orthography, had omitted the concluding ‘L’ of his Christian name.</p>
<p>The Pickwick Club (as might have been expected from so enlightened an institution) received this statement with the contempt it deserved, expelled the presumptuous and ill–conditioned Blotton from the society, and voted Mr. Pickwick a pair of gold spectacles, in token of their confidence and approbation: in return for which, Mr. Pickwick caused a portrait of himself to be painted, and hung up in the club room.</p>
<p>Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He also wrote a pamphlet, addressed to the seventeen learned societies, native and foreign, containing a repetition of the statement he had already made, and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many ‘humbugs.’ Hereupon, the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused, several fresh pamphlets appeared; the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies; the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into English; the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.</p>
<p>But this base attempt to injure Mr. Pickwick recoiled upon the head of its calumnious author. The seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the presumptuous Blotton an ignorant meddler, and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever. And to this day the stone remains, an illegible monument of Mr. Pickwick’s greatness, and a lasting trophy to the littleness of his enemies.</p>

<p>In <em>The Times</em> of Friday, October 18th, 1895, p2, the growing debate in the letters columns of <em>The Times</em> is recognised, and the additional information provided by the <em>Western Mail</em> correspondent “Gwynfardd Dyfed”, whose real identity is disclosed, is recognised:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Writing under date October 15 from Haverfordwest with reference to the letter on this subject by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland which appeared in <em>The Times</em> on Monday last, and in the last paragraph of which the writer suggested that the authorities for the statements in certain contributions on this subject which had recently appeared in the <em>Western Mail</em> had not been given, Mr. Frederick J. Warren (Gwynfardd Dyfed) says that in the contribution to the <em>Western Mail</em> of September 18 last he quoted portions of certain works not therein named. On September 25 a letter appeared in the same paper from Mr. Hartland asking him if he would furnish all the necessary particulars of the authorities cited. On the 8th of the present month he supplied this information through the same medium, and, as it would seem that Mr. Hartland did not see this second contribution containiug the authentications asked for, he now gives them as follows :- “Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales : With the Scenery of the River Wye,” by Thomas Roscoe, Esq., published in 1854 by Mr. Henry G. Bohn, York-street, Covent-garden ; also “Cymru Fu-Notes and Queries relating to the Past History of Wales and the Border Counties, publishd in 1888 by Messrs Daniel Owen and Co.

<p>The following week was a quiet one as far as correspondence goes, but it seems that Mr. Thomas, now writing from Eastbourne, was penning a response that was to appear in <em>The Times</em> of Monday, October 28th, 1895, p4.</p>
<p>The letter opens in a courteous enough manner, with Thomas explaining that his response will be focussed on one specific matter:</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>Letter to the Editor, <em>The Times</em>, N. W. Thomas, Eastbourne, Monday, October 28th, 1895</p>
</aside>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THE SIN-EATER IN WALES., TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.</p>
<p>Sir,- Mr. Hartland’s letter raises several very interesting points which would require to be discussed at some length. I must, however, confine myself to the question mainly raised by my first letter-the evidence for the recent existence of the sin-eater.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then explains his concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As I should explain, did space permit, I do not regard analogical evidence as very satisfactory for two reasous-(1) Aubrey may have misinterpreted a ceremony which he saw (he does not tell us that the name sin-eater was used, I think); (2) the sin-eater, if he existed, may not unreasonably be regarded as the result of a misunderstanding of other customs.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And identifies what he sees as the source of Hartland’s evidence:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The evidence for the recent existence in Wales of this personage is the evidence of Mr. Moggridge-a story related by him at Ludlow, and derived no one knows where, at least second hand, perhaps third, fourth, or fifth hand.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He then identifies the sources who failed to find evidence of the tradition, stressing their credentials in terms of being able to collect folklore from local populations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Against this we have the evidence of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the Nonconformist minister-no doubt such a conjunction is enough to damn any cause; but we must remember that the schoolmaster was no tyro at folklore, he had collected legends and customs for Sir Thomas Phillipps. Even a clergyman and a diocesan inspector can elicit ghost stories in a strange parish. Much more can a local schoolmaster find a sin-eater.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The lack of evidence is further noted in published Welsh sources:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Secondly, no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the name is known.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And finally, the lack of witnesses coming forward to say they have observed the tradition, is noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Thirdly, no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the balance of probability then, Thomas suggests that even if Hartland’s claims are sound, there is no <em>recent</em> evidence of the sin-eating tradition in Wales:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Even if I accepted Mr. Hartland’s canon of evidence I should not think that probability lay on his side. Holding that folklore requires stricter evidence of customs, which an eye-witness might readily misinterpret, I hold to my position that the sin-eater has not existed in Wales in recent times.,</p>

<div><p>[The <em>Times</em> declined to publish a fuller reply to Mr Hartland, on the ground that the subject was not of sufficient general interest. –Ed.]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Presumably the editor at <em>Bye-Gones</em> was in some form of communication with Mr. Hartland.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the <em>Welsh Gossip</em> section of both the <em>South Wales Echo</em> of October 29th, 1895, <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4602627/4602631/98/">p4</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3735711/3735715/44/">p4</a> of the <em>South Wales Daily News</em> on the same date, as well as the <em>Welsh Gleanings</em> section of the <em>Cardiff Times</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3431033/3431034/10/">November 2nd, 1895</a>, p1, the following paragraph appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Mr N. W. Thomas, New College, Eastbourne, writes to the <em>Times</em> pointing out that no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the name is known. That no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not sruprising that by this point, if not before, the debate had started to attract attention within Welsh speaking circles, In <em>Y Cymro</em> ((“The Welshman”), for example, an article appeared in the edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4279654/4279666/98/Y%20BWYTAWR%20PECHOD">October 30th, 1895, p12</a> referring to an “enthusisatic Welshman” (Mr. N. W. Thomas) who had written to the <em>Times</em> quoting Reverends Silvan Evans and Eynon Davies in his dismissal of claims suround the sin-eater in Wales, and Sidney Hartland’s response citing Aubrey and Pennant.</p>

</div>
<p>The following day, on <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3451868/3451872">October 31st,1895, p4</a>, <em>Y Cymro</em> published another column on the matter. The definition given for the sin-eater was taken from Brewer’s <em>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em>, with a comment to the effect that since there appears to be no Welsh word to describe the ritual, an English text had to be consulted. Hartland’s lack of knowledge about the Welsh is remarked upon.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The “expanded and corrected” twelfth edition at least, of Brewer’s <em>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em>, published in 1891, included an entry for the sin-eater.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps of greater concern was that a Welsh work on Welsh traditions, <em>Hynafion Cymreig</em>, published in Carmarthen in 1823, just a few short miles from the supposed loction where the sin-eater tradition was claimed to be practised, also had no name for the tradition and made no mention of. That food rituals were evident around funerals was not challenged. That they did take place should not be considered as surprising, helping mediate expressions of sympathy at a family funeral, just as food surely played a role in mediating the spread of joy at a wedding.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by the <em>Y Cymro</em> article, editorial staff over at the <em>Evening Express</em> also quoted Brewer’s <em>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</em> in their edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3256919/3256923/81/">October 31st, 1895</a>, p4:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Gathered from Gwalia</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Apropos to the discussion on the sin-eater, the following from “Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable” may not be without interest:— “Sin-eaters— Persons hired at funerals in ancient times to take upon themselves the sins of the deceased that the soul might be delivered from purgatory. Notice was given tc. an old sire before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket [low stool], on which he sat down facing the door; then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate, and a bowl of ale, which ho drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Seemingly now on a roll, there was now no let up at <em>Y Cymro</em>, where the edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3588373/3588387/36/Y%20BWYTAWR%20PECHOD">November 2nd, 1895, p14</a>, where the tone was increasingly one of chagrine at claims made by Englishmen against the morality of the Welsh, claims that not even the righteous Mr. Prichard, poet, and author of the <em>Cannwyll y Cymry</em>, published over three centuries earlier, had managed to discover.</p>
<p>The commentary in the Welsh language <em>Y Cymro</em> is picked up a few days later in the <em>Merthyr Times and Dowlais Times and Aberdare Echo</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3098997/3099002/28/">November 11th, 1895, p5</a>. The note begins with a brief summary of the tradition, as given by Moggrdge:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Notes and Comments</p>
<p>WAS the ancient custom of Sin-eating ever prevalent in Wales ? The Sin-eater was one who “ate” the sins of a dead man, and so delivered his soul from purgatory. The practice seems to have varied in its details. Mr. Matthew Moggridge, in 1852, described to the Cambrian Archaeological Society what he alleged to be done within the memory of people then living in the neighbourhood of Llandebie, in Carmarthenshire. The Sin-eater, he says, placed a quantity of salt on the bosom of the dead man, and a small piece of bread on the salt. Then, with loud lamentations, he ate the piece of bread, and so took into himself, as it were, all the sins of the deceased. The sum of half-a-crown was given him by the mourning relatives, and he ran away as soon as he could out of sight, for he was hated by all, and looked upon as a lost man.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That account had provided the basis for Hartland’s more recent exposition; but could it be trusted, for example, given the claims in <em>Y Cymro</em> that a Welsh publication from the supposed area where the tradition was extant, at the time it was supposedly still being employed, made no mention of it, or anything like it?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Is Moggridge’s story to be relied upon ? At the recent meetings of the British Association it was recounted by Mr. Sidney Hartland, who based upon it his statement as to the prevalence of the custom in parts of Wales within the present century. The <em>Cymro</em>, in an erudite and interesting article on the question, adduces some facts to show that Moggridge was wrong. There was published in Carmarthen, some dozen miles from Llandebie, in the year 1823, a book containing a collection of Welsh superstitions. This book, called “Hynafion Cymreig,” has not a word about Sin-eating. Had the custom, as Moggridge alleged, been in existence it would certainly have been mentioned in the “Hynafion.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The author has no doubts on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is almost impossible to escape the conclusion that Moggridge was misinformed, and that Hartland’s theory therefore falls to the ground. Then we have this further fact the custom is not mentioned in any Welsh literature that is extant. The poets do not refer to it, nor is there a syllable about it in any text-book of antiquities or collections of superstitions and folk-lore. This unbroken silence can only be explained by the absence of the practice in the country.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Immediately following the article, on <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3098997/3099002/29/">p5</a> was a review of “Miss Fiona Macleod’s new book, The Sin-eater”.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Miss Fiona Macleod’s new book, The Sin-eater, published this week, doubtless contains curious and interesting facts about this practice in the Celtic portions of northern Scotland. At any rate, her former books, “The Mountain Lovers” and Pharais,” deal with cognate subjects, and throw much valuable light on the daily life, characteristics, and superstitions of our kinsmen, the Gaels of the Scotch Highlands.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A couple of days later, in the <em>Evening Express</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3257259/3257261/28/">November 13th, 1895</a>, p2 noted a report in a “Birmingham newspaper” (I haven’t yet identified which one) summarising the debate occurring elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Sin-Eater in Wales controversy is summarised by a Birmingham paper, which remarks :— As a preliminary we may explain that sin-eaters, according to certain antiquarians, were a class of men who attended funerals in ancient times, and partook of bread and ale placed on the bier, and so symbolically took on themselves the sins of the deceased. It was believed that whenever this ceremony was performed that the spirit of the dead sinner would be saved from walking the earth in troubled state.</p>
<p>The denial of sin-eating in Wales by Mr. Thomas, of Oswestry, has called forth a mass of evidence in proof of the contrary from Mr. Sidney Hartland, one of the most learned of Midland antiquarians, which is printed in the current number of the “Academy.” Mr. Hartland relies mainly on old-time writers for his information. Aubrey mentions the custom, as performed by a “long, leane, ugly, lamentable, poor raskal” in Herefordshire. When the body was placed on the bier, “a Loafe of Bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar-bowle of maple full of beer, which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after death.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a letter in <em>Y Cymro</em> of <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3451886/3451891/29/">November 14th, 1895, p5</a> introduces  the Welsh terms “diodles” and “diodlas”, which perhaps remind us of the <em>Diodlys</em> tradition described in Bingley’s review of <em>North Wales</em> from 1804. The correspondent provides a description of the <em>diodles</em>/<em>diodlas</em> tradition taken from a Welsh work published in 1820, <em>Drych yr Amseroedd</em> [“Mirror of the Times”].</p>
<p>Breaking the chronology slightly, a correspondent to <em>Y Cymro</em> published on <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3542592/3542598/85/Y%20BWYTAWR%20PECHOD">December 26th, 1895, p6</a> denies the existence of the tradition in the sense of “sin-eating”:</p>
<p>At this point, let take a brief interlude from the correspondence, and see what Fiona Macleod’s fictional short story of a sin-eater in the Highlands has to say. We shall then moving on to a new forum for the correspondence debate, for as the <em>Bye-Gones</em> editor had suggested, <em>The Times</em> had tired of these provincial mutterings, even if the correspondents had not. For it had returned to the home of the original debate, in the pages of <em>The Academy</em>.</p>
