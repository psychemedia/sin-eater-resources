Welsh folk customs
by Owen, Trefor M.
p183-4


Mention must be made at this point of a custom whose very 
existence in Wales has been held in doubt, namely that of the 
‘ sin-eater.’ The first reference to the ‘ sin-eater ’ anywhere to 
be found Is in the manuscripts of the seventeenth-century writer 
John Aubrey who wrote of him thus: ‘ In the county of Hereford 
was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to 
take upon them the sins of the party deceased.... The manner 
was that when the corpse was brought out of the house and 
laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered 
to the sin-cate r, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, 
full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in 
money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipse 
all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking 
after they were dcad.’^ Aubrey adds that the custom existed 
in Llangors, Brecknockshire in 1640, and in 1686, he writes 
‘ this custom is used to this day in north Wales.Apart from 
Aubrey, the custom is not mentioned by name by any other 
writer until 185Z when Mathew Moggridge of Swansea 
described the custom and added further details which he 
maintained were obtained from Llandybic, Carmarthenshire, 
where the practice ‘ was said to have prevailed to a recent 
period.’ The additional material comprised the foUowing 
description. * When a person died, his friends sent for the 
Sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of 
salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of 
bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread which 
he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. 
This done he received the fee of 2S. 6d. and vanished as quickly 
as possible from the general gaze ; for as it was believed he 
really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all

those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he ^vas 
utterly detested in the neighbourhood—regarded as a mere 
Pariah’—as one inredeemably lost.’^ The existence of the 
custom has been denied by Silvan Evans who described Iiimsclf 
as not having been ‘ indiiferent as to the customs and legends 
of the land of his birth * and whose profession {clergyman), lie 
added, often brought him to contact with funerals.* Moreover 
another writer who had lived at Uandyble for many years and 
who claimed to be well acquainted witli the history of the 
parish, its customs and traditions, had ‘ never heard of such a 
thing * as a sin-eater* The evidence of this writer is impressive 
because he had collected ‘ Welsh lore ’ for Sir Thomas Phillips 
and claimed to be well-acquainted with ‘ Welsh lore ’ in 
almost every parish in south Wales/ While Moggridge’s 
claim maybe open to doubt—he may well have been misled In 
his interpretation by the practice of placing salt on a plate on 
the body of the deceased—Aubrey’s evidence may have been 
true of the seventeenth century. Even he may have been over- 
emphasiring a custom which Lewis Morris and Bingley 
describe as existing in Gwynedd, namely the eating of bread 
and ale over the cofhn by a poor person. But neither of these 
writers, admittedly describing conditions in a later period, 
makes any allusion to a belief similar to that outlined by 
Aubrey, which accompanied this custom. The evidence as 
regards Aubrey’s claim is not conclusive, but it appears that the 
nineteenth-ccniury description of the custom is not well- 
founded.
