Welsh folk customs
by Owen, Trefor M.

1959
p183-4


Mention must be made at this point of a custom whose very existence in Wales has been held in doubt, namely that of the 'sin-eater.' The first reference to the 'sin-eater' anywhere to be found is in the manuscripts of the seventeenth-century writer John Aubrey who wrote of him thus: 'In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased.... The manner was that when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the sin-eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipse all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.' [Lansdowne MSS i& B.M., dUd by Win Sikes ? Biiiiih Goblins, p.325]] Aubrey adds that the custom existed in Llangors, Brecknockshire in 1640, and in 1686, he writes 'this custom is used to this day in north Wales'. Apart from Aubrey, the custom is not mentioned by name by any other writer until 1852 when Mathew Moggridge of Swansea described the custom and added further details which he maintained were obtained from Llandybic, Carmarthenshire, where the practice 'was said to have prevailed to a recent period.' The additional material comprised the foUowing description. 'When a person died, his friends sent for the Sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done he received the fee of 2S. 6d. and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze ; for as it was believed he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood—regarded as a mere Pariah—as one irredeemably lost.' [*Arch. Camb.* 1852, p.30] The existence of the custom has been denied by Silvan Evans who described himself as not having been 'indiiferent as to the customs and legends of the land of his birth * and whose profession (clergyman), he added, often brought him to contact with funerals. [*Bye Gones*: 24 November, 1875] Moreover another writer who had lived at Llndybïe for many years and who claimed to be well acquainted with the history of the parish, its customs and traditions, had 'never heard of such a thing' as a sin-eater. [*Western mail*, 16 December, 1875.] The evidence of this writer is impressive because he had collected 'Welsh lore' for Sir Thomas Phillips and claimed to be well-acquainted with 'Welsh lore' in almost every parish in South Wales. [He was Mr. John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaser at Llandybïe for many years commencing 1850. He claimed that the customhad not existed within the memory of the oldest inhabitants, a view which was confirmed by the vicar of the parish at the time.(*Bye-gones*: 9 February, 1876). Cf. also Gomer M. Roberts, *Hanes Plywf Llandybie*, p. 271] While Moggridge's claim maybe open to doubt—he may well have been misled in his interpretation by the practice of placing salt on a plate on the body of the deceased—Aubrey's evidence may have been true of the seventeenth century. Even he may have been over-emphasising a custom which Lewis Morris and Bingley describe as existing in Gwynedd, namely the eating of bread and ale over the cofhn by a poor person. But neither of these writers, admittedly describing conditions in a later period, makes any allusion to a belief similar to that outlined by Aubrey, which accompanied this custom. The evidence as regards Aubrey’s claim is not conclusive, but it appears that the nineteenth-ccniury description of the custom is not well-founded.
