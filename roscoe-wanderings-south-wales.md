" So late as the earlier part of the last century, that 
strange character of a stranger superstition, known by 
the name of 'The Sin-Eater,' was not unknown in 



SUPERSTITIONS. 63 

Wales. This was some desperate being, who (unless 
we suppose him an unbeliever), being past redemption, 
lost to all hope of salvation, did, for a slight reward, or 
to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his 
own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, 
sometimes receiving confession during life, and bar- 
gaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his 
already laden soul. 

** Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, 
quotes a letter which speaks of a 'Sin-Eater,' who 
'lived by Boss highway,' and is described as a ' gaunt, 
ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal.' 

''A gentleman, who lived a little before the time of 
this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this 
brief account of what is believed to have been the last 
'Sin-Eater of Wales/ 

"'I got lost,' says he, 'near nightfall, after being 
landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on 
the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black tur- 
bary of great extent divided me from the road. I was 
cautioned to ride far round this pitchy bog, for no 
horse ever ventured among the peat-pits — the whole 
being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was enough, 
under a black evening, to keep me off, even without 
peril of being swallowed, man and horse. 

"'At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of 
a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a 
cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at 
a distance. The house was on a high point and turn 
of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow 
ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard 
sounds of wailing within, and soon a woman came out 
 

into the dead niglit, late as it was, and cried a name to 
the top pitch of her wild Toice, that seemed one I had 
heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay 
a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a hit of 
hread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting 
to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office; that is, to 
eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place 
the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the 
cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or 
penances from that paidoned dead man for ever, to 
him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of 
soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever.' 

'' This is the traveller's account of this incident. He 
had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion 
of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their 
standing-point. After waiting long, he caught a far- 
out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, 
till she kindled on the high road's point the straw of 
her husband's late bed — ^the usual signal of a death in 
the house. 

" ' The Sin-Eater,' he was told, ' lived alone in a hovel 
made of sea- wreck, and nails of such, between sea- 
marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by 
day, none dare by night; whether for the footing, or 
the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that 
recluse.' "
