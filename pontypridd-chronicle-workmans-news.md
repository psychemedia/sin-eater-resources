CHURCH FOLK LORE. Writing in the Newbury House  Magazine anent "Church Folk Lore," the Hev. J. E. -Vatix records a very remarkable custom which prevailed up t, say, a* couple of'hundred years ago. There was in one of the villages adjoining Wales an old man who was called "The Sin Eater." His office was, for a trifling consideration, to pawn (so to SDeak) his own soul for the ease and rest. of a soul departed. When a pi rson died, notice was given to him, and he at once went to the hi me of the deceased. A cricket—i.e., a stool—was brought, and he sat down in front of the door. A groat, a crust of brea 1, and a lull bowl of ale were given to him, after the con- sumption of which he rose and pronounced the "ease and rest 01 the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul." It was believed that this cere- I mony would free the departed soul from "walking" thenceforth. It is probable that this s range custom was originally connected some way with th^ cere- m ny ot the Scape Goat under the Law (Lev. xvi. 21). This institution of the "Sin Eater was in later times mainly confined to the county of Hereford; but there is reason to believe that it once prevailed generally in Wales.
