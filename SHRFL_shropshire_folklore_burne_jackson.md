One very curious and repulsive outgrowth from the custom of 
funeral doles must here be noticed, as by some it has been set down 
as a Shropshire practice. I mean the well-known account of th6 
Sin-eater, taken from Aubrey's Remahw^in which, let me point out, 
there is no reference made to Shropshire at all, I will quote the 
passage in full. 

* SINNE-EATERS. 

* In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to (hire) have poor 
people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the yBity deceased. Oue 
of them I remember Uved in a cottage on Rosse high- way. (He was long, leane, 
ugly, lamentable poor raskel.) The manner was that when the Corps was 
brought out of the house and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of bread was brought 
out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazer-bowle of 
maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, w^^ he was to diinke up, and sixpence in 
money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him {ipso facto) all the Sinnes of 
the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This 
custome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scapegoate in y^ old Lawe. 



* Blake WAY, Sheriffs of Shropshire (1831), p. 170. Mr. Blakeway says 
these offerings were still customary in North Wales when he wrote, but they 
seem (see Brand, Antiquities^ II. 208) to have there been made rather for the 
benefit of the parson than of the poor. No doubt they were once intended to 
purchase masses for the repose of the soul of the deceased.

DEATH. 307 

Leviticus, cap. xvi. verse 21. 22 This Custome (though rarely used in 

our dayes) yet by some people was (observed) continued even in the strictest time 
of ye Presbyterian government : as at Dynder, volcns nolens the Parson of y® 
Parish, the (kinred) relations of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie 
punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at 
ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her 
death a Mazard-bowle for the Siune-eater ; and the like in other places in this 
Countie; as also in Brecon, e. g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 
1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient customme. I believe this 
customme was heretofore used over all Wales. 

* See Juvenal Satyr. VI. (519 — 521), where he speakes of throwing purple 
thread into y* river to carry away ones slnne. In North Wales, the sinne eaters 
are frequently made use of ; but there, insted of a Bowie of Beere, they have a 
bowle of Milke. Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls 
have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were 
continued at Grentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. 
And so in Germany at rich mens funeralls Doles are in use, and to every one a 
quart of strong and good Beer. — Cramer.' * 

The connection of this custom with Shropshire rests on the 
authority of John Bagford, whose letter on the subject is dated 
Feb. 1st, 1714 — 15. He says, * Within the memory of our Fathers, 
in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person 
dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire (for so they called him) 
who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood 
before the door of the house, when some of the Family came out and 
furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. 
Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of 
Bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of Ale, which he drank ofE at 
a draught After this, he got up from the Cricket and pronounced, 
with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the Soid departed, for 
tchich he would pawn his own Soul. This I had from the ingenious 
John Aubrey, Esq., who made a Collection of curious Observations, 
which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. 
Churchill, the bookseller.' 2 

It will be seen that Bagford is therefore but a second-hand 
authority, whose account was committed to writing some thirty years 
after Aubrey's own. It is singular, to say the least of it, that iio

other writer has ever even alluded to such a practice;^ Aubrey has 
always been noted for his romance and credulity, yet it seems hardly 
possible that he could have misunderstood a matter which he relates 
80 circumstantially and apparently from personal knowledge. It is 
easier to believe that in some wild and remote places the custom of 
giving doles to the poor was kept up after the precise nature of the 
benefit to the soul of the dead man (expected in pre-Eeformation 
days) had been forgotten, and that among ignorant people it was 
corrupted into the debasing superstition which Aubrey describes. 
But Salopians will be slow to believe that his story concerns their 
county until further evidence be forthcoming. 

Much later than Aubrey's time, the funeral dole survived in 
^orth Wales in its more primitive and innocent form. Pennant in 
his History of WhiUford describes the nearest female relative of the 
dead giving bread, cheese, ale, and money to the poor over the 
coffin, and Mr. Wirt Sikes reproduces a curious 18th-century print of 
such a scene.* 

The funeral ?ponge-cakes of North Shropshire are still, or were 
recently, in use in Wales also.* It is much to be wished that 
the subject of the ceremonial use of cakes could be farther investi- 
gated.* One cannot but suspect that the funeral cakes were in 
their first origin not a dole to purchase prayers, but a part of the 
ceremonial of the pagan burial-feasts; of which we really seem to 
retain other traces in Shropshire, to judge from the following passage 
in a letter addressed by the Rev. G. L. Wasey to Miss Jackson in 
1873. He speaks of course of the neighbourhood of Bridgnorth. 

* As to Dining at funerals : it is not done here : but a very sub- 
stantial " Dejeuner a la Fourchette '* at which all the guests (not the 

* But in 1852 Mr. Matthew Moggridge of Swansea asserted at the Cambrian 
Archaeological Society's Annual Meeting, that the custom had then been recently 
practised in the parish of Llandebie, Caermarthenshire. See Wirt Stkes, 
British Goblins, p. 826.

* E. g. we have Wedding, or, as it used to be called, Bride Cake, Christening 
Cake, Yule Cake, Twelfth Cake, Simnel Cakes, Soul Cakes, etc. : to say nothing 
of the divinations and magical remedies in which the baking of specially com- 
pounded cakes (as the Dumb Cake) plays a part.
