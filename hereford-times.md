VARIETIES.

... 

Curious Custom.

A strange popish custom prevailed in Monmouthshire and other western counties till very recently. Many funerals were attended by a professed "sin-eater," hired to take upon him the guilt of the deceased. By swallowing bread and beer, with a suitable ceremony before the corpse, he was supposed to free it from every penalty for past offences, appropriating the punishment to himself. Men who undertook so daring an imposture must all have been infidels, willing, apparently, like Esau, to sell their birthright for a mess pottage.

CAMBRIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. MEETING AT LUDLOW.

CAMBRIAN ARCHÆOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. MEETING AT LUDLOW. 

THE SIN-EATER. 

M. MOGGRiDGE Esq., made some remarks upon a singular custom which formerly existed in Wales, in connection with deceased persons, and which he had recently discovered was noticed in old work, being prevalent the neighbourhood of Ross, Herefordshire. The custom was this—when party died, a person known by the name of "the sin-eater was called in, who placed upon the corpse a platter containing a loaf of bread and some salt; the sin-eater afterwards ate the bread,and doing so was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the deceased person. Happily, however, the light of Christian age was rapidly banishing superstition from the minds of the people, and that custom had, he believed, now disappeared.

Mr. Allen remarked that there still existed a custom in Wales of placing a candle salt, and burning it in the chamber of deceased person. Was this in any way connected with the custom just described was the popular notion that the candle stuck in the salt would scare away the evil spirit, awl it was usual for the friends of the deceased to watch the corpse for a certain period.

The Rev. J. B. James reminded the meeting of the of this custom—the scape goat. 

Mr. Symons wished to understand distinctly whether this custom still prevailed, and if so, what extent. Itwas to be hoped that, for the credit religion iv this country, the custom was extinct. To send missionaries abroad to convert the heathen when a state of things disgusting and abhorrent existed at home, was perfect farce. The mere practice of putting salt on the bodies of corpses to prevent decomposition was a distinct custom, and totally irrelevant to the subject of this discussion.

The President considered that the object of the inquiry was that we might understand the and practices of the past. When a corpse lay state, there was always person appointed to remain with it during that exhibition. He viewed that only a mark respect to the deceased. He apprehended that, so far as explanation could now be given, may some way have arisen from practice.

Mr. Moggridge considered it to be an eastern custom, which he believed was now extinct.

Mr. Freeman made some brief observations on the word "sin-eater," as used by Mr. Moggridge.

Mr. Hodges, of Ludlow, surgeon, said that it was a common practice to place a pewter filled with salt upon a corpse. Pewter was known good conductor of heat, and the salt had cooling effect.

Mr. Wynne said believed it was used in Merionethshire to prevent decomposition of the body.
