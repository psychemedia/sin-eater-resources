SIN-EATERS. Within the last few decades a curious custom nas disappeared in Wales. This (says a writer in the current issue of the Rambler) is the sin-eating ceremony. It was the practice, when anyone died. for a relative to place on his or her body a quantity of bread, cheese, and beer. The sin-eater" was rlien sent for, and his duty was to consume these provisions, and to pronounce the everlasting rest of the departed. It was believed that, like the Hebrew scapegoat, he thus took upon himself the misdoings of the departed, and, by the act of eating the food. freed the soul of the deceased from all its burden of sin. As to the eventual responsibility of the sin- enter himself we have no conclusive information. Perhaps a brother sin-eater" eventually relieved him. At any rate, he found good provender to ease his conscience qualms.
