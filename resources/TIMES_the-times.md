THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.,IPSWICH, Sept. 11. (Wednesday)
The annual meeting of the British Association was opened to-day under circumstances which augur favourably for a week of useful activity, sustained by sufficient, but not overwhelming, numbers. Up to this evening nearly 1,200 tickets had been issued. The weather is cooler than it was three days ago and is broken by sharp showers, too short to cause much inconvenience.

THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION, Ipswich, Sept 15th

The engineers dealt with a short and varied programme. The Anthropologists had their meeting-place crowded during a discussion on cannibalism, in which there was apparently an under-current of feeling not quite in accord with popular sentiment.

Section H - Anthropology

This section assembled in the morning at the Working Men's College, under the presidency of Professor Flinders Petrie There was a crowded attendance to hear Captain Hinde's papers on cannibalism and the pigmy tribes in the Congo region.

The CHAIRMAN, in introducing Captain Hinde, said that we had been accustomed to look upon cannibalism as something extremely unnatural; but it had not at all been so regarded by a large number of the rest of mankind. We should endeavour to cast aside a little insular prejudice in listening to the paper.

CAPTAIN S. L. HINDE, who has been travelling and fighting for some years in the Congo basin, said that almost all the races in the Congo basin practise cannibalism, and, though in some parts it is prevented by the presence of white civilization, in others it seems to be on the increase. An extensive traffic in human flesh prevails in many districts, slaves being kept and sold as an article of food. The different tribes have various and horrible methods of preparing the flesh for eating; in some instances, before the death of the victim, certain tribes of the Bangala race themselves acknowledge that they break the arms and legs of the victim, and place the body thus mutilated and still living in water for two or three days, on the supposition that this pre-mortem treatment renders the flesh more palatable. There are also distinct tribal preferences for various parts of the body, and it is remarkable that, contrary to an ignorant yet very generally accepted theory, the negro man-eater never eats flesh raw, and certainly takes human flesh as food purely and simply, and not from any religions or superstitious reasons. In the country of the Balétéla one saw neither gray-haired persons, halt, maimed, nor blind. Even parents were eaten by their children on the approach of the least sign of old age. Under such circumstances the Balétéla were a splendid race. After a fight the native camp-followers of his expedition invariably ate up all the dead, leaving absolutely nothing for the jackals. In this way they undoubtedly saved the expedition from many an epidemic. With regard to the pygmies, he said their average height was under 4ft., and it was as difficult to detect their presence in the forest as it would be to find a mouse in a cornfield. 'hey were a nomadic race, and, being hunters, followed the game in its migration through the forest according to the season. They were courageous, pugnacious, and had an intimate knowledge of poisons. Death succeeded in from three to ten minutes after a scratch was made by one of their tiny poisoned arrows.

Mr. ELWORTHY said he appeared in the character of "devil's advocate" and thought there was something to be said in favour of cannibalism. Underlying it was the primeval idea that the body imbibed the properties of that which it ate. Upon that idea – and with all possible reverence he said it – was founded one of the most solemn of our Christian rites. In one part of France even now tbe last of the harvest corn was baked into a loaf made in the form of a human figure. This was supposed to represent the spirit of the corn – the spirit of vegetation, reproduction, fertility – and was broken up, distributed among the villagers, and eaten.

Mr. ROUSE, speaking on the authority of Mrs. M'Kittrick, wife of Mr. M'Kittrick, of the Congo Ballolo (Baptist) Mission, who remained to carry on missionary work after her husband's death, said that under the influenee of Gospel teaching the practice of cannibalism in that region had almost wholly ceased. What was the derivation of the wvord cannibal?

Mr. DARNELL DAVIS, of British Guiana, said it was derived from the Caribs, or Carribals, who ate the bodies of their enemies under the impression that they would thereby absorb the courage of the latter. A French writer had described the Caribs as such anthropophagic epicures that they could detect the different flavour of a Frenchman, a Spaniard, and an Englishman, and they liked the French flavour best. In regard to Captain Hinde's "sly dig" at the missionaries, speaking as an unprejudiced Government official, he thought missionaries were hampered in their work by the fact that other white men, as a rule, practised the very opposite of what the missionaries preached.

Mr. E. S. HARTLAND said that in all probability the earliest form of cannibalism was that of the eating of deceased relatives. This practice extended over bhe greater part of the world, and many people would be surprised to learn that traces of it were to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own islands. Not very long ago in Upper Bavaria, when a man died and had been laid out, a cake was made of ordinary flour. The corpse was placed before the fire, and this cake, called the corpse cake, was put upon its breast to rise. The dough, in rising, was believed to absorb all the virtues of the deceased, and the cake was afterwards eaten by his nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peniusula an edible image of the dead was carried in the funeral procession. When the body was buried the mourners ate this image above the grave, saying as they did so, "God resthim." In Wales the practice of employing a "sin-eater" had only ceased within the memory of men still living. It was the custom for the nearest relative, usually a woman, to hand across the bier, or place upon the breast of the corpse, bread, cheese, and beer, which were eaten by the sin-eater, who pronounced everlasting rest to the departed. It was believed that the sin-eater by this means appropriated to himself all the sins which the deceased had committed during his lifetime.

Mr. STEPHEN BOURNE testified to the value of missionary effort in the spread of civilization, humanity, and religion.

Mr. SCOTT ELLIOTT gave details of the habits of the human "leopard" cannibals of the West Coast of Africa, and said that had it not been for Captain Hinde's expedition he himself would have been killed and eaten. He had noticed that cannibalism in Africa seemed to be confined to the region of the dark forests.

CAPTAIN HINDE regretted that it should have been inferred from his paper that he had any intention of attacking missionaries; such was not the case in the least.

THE SIN EATER IN WALES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

Sir,

In your issue of Monday Mr. E. S. Hartland is reported to have said, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism in the Anthropological Section of the British Association, that the sin-eater has only disappeared from Wales within living memory.

If, as I imagine, Mr. Hartland's evidence for this survival is presented to us in his article on the subject in Folklore for June, 1892, I venture to think it is wholly insufficiant. Mr. Hartland's words are (p. 148), " Mr. Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie. . . as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period." These words are a paraphrase from the report of the Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol. III., N.S., p. 330. The exact words used by Mr. Moggridge are as follows :-' There (near Llandebie) the above practice (of the sin-eater) was said to have prevailed to a recent period. "

This evidence is originally at best second hand; it is unfortunate that Mr. Hartland has emphasized its value; in the article in Folklore, Mr. Moggridge's evidence has the appearance of beiug the result of personal observation. Thuw at the outset Mr. Hartland's evidence is weakened.

But to any one who has considered the discussion in the Academy in the winter of 1870-76 it seems quite incredible that Mr. Moggridge's evidence should be quoted at all. Canon Silvan Evans collected the evidence on the question. Among others, the vicar of the parish and the schoolmaster testified to the non-existence of the superstition. The vicar quoted an intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in the parish. He said that such a custorm, in his opinion, could not have appeared for the last 200 years, or he would have heard of it from his father or grandfather, who lived to a great age. The vicar concluded that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge could not be substantiated by any reliable evidence.

The schoolmaster, Mr. John Rowland, who lived in Llandebie in 1852, when Mr. Moggridge spoke, was equally emphatic. He said he knew all the parishioners and the history of the parish, its customs, legends, and traditions, and during the time he was there he attended many funerals, but never heard of a sin-eater ; in fact, people never gave cakes at funerals in Llandebie.

Is it possible that Mr. Hartland has never seen this discussion, or has he ignored it ? In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to assert that the sin-eater was known within living memory in the locality named.

In addition to this, in February, 1882, the Rev. T. Eynon Davies published a letter in the Christian World a propos of Paxton Hood's " Christmas Evans." Mr. Davies was Congregational minister in Cwmannan, near Llandebie, and said, " Some octogenarians whom I have questioned have never seen a sin-eater, neither have they heard their parents nor their grandparents refer to this custom." There is, in fact, no evidence that he ever existed in Wales at all. All the stories go back to Aubrey's " lean, long, ugly, lamentable,poor Raskel "; and he was at Ross, in Herefordshire, if we believe Aubrey, none too strong a witness.

If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the " sin-eater " in modern times, stamped originally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, sealed 30 years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association. Even the Celtic fringe does not deserve this treatment.,I am, &c.,

SANDOWN PIER, ISLE OF WIGHT.
The Attorney General and Miss Webster yesterday performed the ceremony of opening the pier and pier pavilion in Sandown Bay. The pier has been lengthened by 545ft., with a pier-head 107ft. by 93ft., and a pavilion has been built capable of accommodating 400 people, at a total cost of about £12,800. The pier and pavilion were illuminated in the evening.

SMOKING IN CHURCH.

Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to us from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing :-" Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice -viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. "The Communion-table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverance. I have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it abould be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten."

The Sin-Eater.
Author: E. SIDNEY HARTLAND

THE SIN-EATER, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

Sir,

Amid the hurry of the concluding meetings of the British Association I did not see Mr. Thomas's letter in your issue of Wednesday last; and it is only to-day that I have had an opportunity of reading it. I am much obliged to him for calling my attention to the fact that the existence of the sin-eater in Wales has been questioned. I gather that he is a reader of Folklore. Had he challenged the statements in my article when it was published there, I should have been doubly grateful, since my only object is to elicit and preserve the truth; assuredly not to cast any imputation upon Welshmen I have never seen the discussion in the Academy, nor Mr. Eynon Davies's letter in the Christian World to which Mr. Thomas refers; nor have I, until now, heard of any doubt being thrown upon the matter.

Unfortunately, I have no access here to the old numbers of the Academy. Will Mr. Thomas kindly add to my obligation by lending me those containing the discussion on the sin-eater, if he have copies of them? Meantime, I reserve all observations upon the evidence until I have seen them. I am. &eC.,

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.

Sir,
-With reference to the Welsh superstition of the sin-eater, the existence of which is doubted by Mr. Ede, those interested in the question may like to know that a full account of the superstition is given in " The Mountain Decameron," by Joseph Downes, a now very rare book, published by Bentley in 1836, in three volumes.

On page 232 of vol. 3 there is the following heading - "The Last Sin-Eater of Wales, a Sketch," &c.

The chapter that follows is most interesting and minute, and seemns to be a literal transcript of fact. It is not strange, however, that the oldest inhabitant now living should not have heard of " the sin-eater," since Joseph Downe, writing in 1836, himself says in the sentence introductory to his sketch, " So late an the earlier part of the last century that strange character of a stranger superstition known by the name of 'the sin-eater ' was not unknown in Wales."

What follows is an account in quotation marks of "what is believed to be the last sin-eater in Wales," taken apparently from the printed work of some traveller whom Downes does not name. It is too long for quotation, but should be read by any one interested in the subject, as details of place and incident are so vivid that the traveller's experience can scarcely be doubted. I am, Sir, yours obediently,
Z.

The Sin-Eater In Wales.
Author: E. SIDNEY HARTLAND.
Issue: 34707

THE SIN EATER IN WALES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,

-Your correspondent, Mr. N. W. Thomas, denies the existence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the Academy of 20 years ago and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the Christian World of February, 1882. By the courtesy of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Woodall I have now been furnished with the correspondence containing these statements.

I will deal with the negative evidence presently. Let us first see what positive evidence of the existence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr. Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey. This is true, in the sense that Aubrey is the earliest writer to mention the custom and that he gives the fullest account of it. I do not know what grounds Mr. Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey's testimony. He was a careful and enlightened inquirer into old customs.; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open ; his bona fides is not to be questioned ; and his description of the ceremony and the expressions he makes use of testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statement than casual gossip. He gives specific instances of sin-eating, not merely at Ross, as Mr. Thomas says, but also at Dynder, at Hereford, and at Llangors, in Brecknockshire, with particulars as to each. He does not, indeed, profess to have himself witnessed these instances. If we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt. But he does seem to have witnessed it, or a ceremony similar to it in all points except the utterance of the ritual words, at Beaumaris or elsewhere in North Wales. Speaking of offertories at funerals he says (" Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme," page 23) :-" These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye Ch. of Engl. Comon-Prayer-booke: but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingraved on it, & ye parties name deceased, wch one accepts of on the other side of ye corps ; and this custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales." Whether we are to understand that Aubrey saw this himself or not, it is clear that he had made minute inquiries. A century later Pennant describes the same custom (" Tours in Wales," ed. 1783, Vol. III., page 150). Pennant was born and lived in Wales ; and we must suppoose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours and friends, if he had not himself witnessed it.

Coming down, to a more recent date, Miss Gertrude Hope,writing in Folklore (Vol. IV., page 392), describes the same ceremony as performed at Market Drayton as lately as the 1st of July, 1803. The details were given to her by an eye-witness, and she significantly adds - "The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been." If necessary, I could give other cases from Shropshire ; and I ought not to leave quite unmentioned the superstition still current in Derbyshire, among a population probably still to a large extent of Celtic ancestry, that every drop of wine drank at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, in accordance with which belief wine is handed round first to the bearers and afterwards to the guests (see S. O. Addy, "Household Tales," 1895, pages 123, 124). Mr. Thomas may, however, deny the relevancy of these; and considerations of space prevent my arguing the question at length here.

Confining myself, therefore, to Wales, I observe that we have explicit assertions, not merely by Aubrey, but also by Pennant, as well as the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr. Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie down to a few years before 1852, when his paper was written. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us, found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited ; but in deference to them it is probable that in many places a compromise would be adopted. The acts would be retained, the words interpreting and completing them would be dropped.

Now, what is the negative evidence ? It amounts to this :-

1. Canon Silvan Evans, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folklore, never found a trace of the custom, nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature.

2. He made inquiries of the vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr. Rowland, the schoolmaster, denied the existence of the practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish of whom the vicar inquired also denied it.

3. The Rev. T. Eynon Davies also denied it in reference to Cwmammman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the statements of octogenarians.

None of these denials can outweigh the positive statements already cited. The custom certainly existed entire in the 17th century at Llangors. Shorn of the ritual words, it maintained itself into the 18th century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembrokeshire. We may be sure it did not maintain itself ony in these places, especially having regard to the practices in Market Drayton and in Derbyshire. It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans's inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeel, was, we are told, an old resident; but the clergyman had only been vicar for 14 years, though he described himself as having known the neighbourhood well for 25 years, which may mean much or little. We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference. In any case they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition, if it existed. The Rev. Elias Owen, Diocesan Inspector of Schools and one of the chief authorities om Welsh folklore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitions of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse " Our people are not superstitious, I am glad to say." His inspection over, he asked the first class " Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a buggan (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of any one who has seen one ?" Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is the people hide their superstitions from aU such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommon experience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev. C. F. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel " witch-burning" case, is express, and is of the greatest weight on this point. The reason of the concealment comes out in his evidence. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages as the priest or the minister to the ancient superstitions.

On the whole, then, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognized by every one), his denials and the results of his inquiries do not countervail the positive evidence of the existence of the sin-eater in Wales - and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev. Eynon Davies, whose inquiries were made later still. I have confined myself to the bare question of fact, and have given little more than an outline of the arguments which I could adduce if I had space for them. The rite is discussed at length in the second volume of my "Legend of Perseus," just published by Mr. David Nutt. Could I have advanced here the considerations there brought forward, I venture to think they would have strongly supported my conclusion. I fear that, consciously or unconsciously, the denial has its roots in a mistaken national or local patriotism, which perhaps peeps forth in Mr. Thomas's vehemence and in his allusion to the "Celtic fringe." We are accustomed to this sort of thing among the Irish, who so greatly resent Giraldus Cambrensis's account of their forefathers (in the main, I believe, perfectly true) that they call any daring lie "a Giraldus." It is fair, however, to Canon Silvan Evans to say that he entirely disclaims this very natural feeling, putting the question purely as one of alleged matter of fact. My own numerous Welsh friends will not suspect me of any antipathy to their nation. or any desire to wound their susceptibilities in declining to accept Mr. Thomas's verdict. I regard the sin-eater only as an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity ; and the last thing I should dream of would be to malke its possession the basis of any imputation against Wales or the Welsh.

I have written without reference to the account in The Mountain Decameron mentiuned by your correspondent "Z," because I have not seen that book. It is probably the nameless authority recently cited by a contributor to the Western Mail. If so,and if the account be authentic (as to which I can offer no opinion), the performance of the ceremony at night, as there described, would explain why the custom in some places eluded clerical notice.

 I am, &c., E. SIDNEY HARTLAND., Highgarth, Gloucester.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Writing under date October 15 from Haverfordwest with reference to the letter on this subject by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland which appeared in *The Times* on Monday last, and in the last paragraph of which the writer suggested that the authorities for the statements in certain contributions on this subject which had recently appeared in the *Western Mail* had not been given, Mr. Frederick J. Warren (Gwynfardd Dyfed) says that in the contribution to the *Western Mail* of September 18 last he quoted portions of certain works not therein named. On September 25 a letter appeared in the same paper from Mr. Hartland asking him if he would furnish all the necessary particulars of the authorities cited. On the 8th of the present month he supplied this information through the same medium, and, as it would seem that Mr. Hartland did not see this second contribution containiug the authentications asked for, he now gives them as follows :- "Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales : With the Scenery of the River Wye," by Thomas Roscoe, Esq., published in 1854 by Mr. Henry G. Bohn, York-street, Covent-garden ; also "Cymru Fu-Notes and Queries relating to the Past History of Wales and the Border Counties, publishd in 1888 by Messrs Daniel Owen and Co. (Limited), of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In the notes in "Cymru Fu", the writers on this subject in turn draw their information from Paxton Hood's Christmas Evans" and from "Blackwood" November. 1875).

The Sin-Eater In Wales.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.,TO THE EDITOR OF TUE TIMES.,Sir,-Mr. Hartland's letter raises several very interesting points which would require to be discussed at some length. I must, however, confine myself to the question mainly raised by my first letter-the evidence for the recent existence of the sin-eater.

As I should explain, did space permit, I do not regard analogical evidence as very satisfactory for two reasous-(1) Aubrey may have misinterpreted a ceremony vwhich he saw (he does not tell us that the name sineater was used, I think); (2) the sin-eater, if he existed, may not unreasonably be regarded as the result of a misunderstanding of other customs.,The evidence for the recent existence in Wales of this personage is the evidence of Mr. Moggridge-a story related by him at Ludlow, and derived no one knows where, at least second hand, perhaps third, fourth, or fifth hand.

Against this we have the evidence of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the Nonconformist minister-no doubt such a conjunction is enoagh to damn any cause; but we must remember that the schoolmaster was no tyro at folklore, he had collected legends and customs for Sir Thomas Phillipps. Even a clergyman and a diocesan inspector can elicit ghost stories in a strange parish. Much more can a local schoolmaster find a sin-eater.

Secondly, no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the name is known.

Thirdly, no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived.

Even if I accepted Mr. Hartland's canon of evidence I should not think that probability lay on his side. Holding that folklore requires stricter evidence of customs, which an eye-witness might readily misinterpret, I hold to my position that the sin-eater has not existed in Wales in recent times.,

I am, &C.., N. W. THOMAS.,New College, Eastbourne.
