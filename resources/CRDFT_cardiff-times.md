AN EXTRAORDINARY WELSH SUPERSTITION.—

In a late issue of the *Newcastle Weekly Chronicle* (which paper, by the way devotes an entire pnge to Notes and Queries) I read an account of a superstition, which, it was alleged, used to be prevalent in parts of Wales; that is, that after a death occurred in a house, a professional, known as the "sin-eater," for a certain fee, agreed to take off all the deceased person's sins, by placing on his corpse a loaf of bread which he (the sin-eater) afterwards devoured ; the finale being that the operator was hunted from the house by the bereaved family, after the manner of the scapegoat of the Bible. I have since seen an article in which the alleged Welsh custom of sin-eating is discredited, and it is therein stated that no instance of the kind has ever been verified. Some of the many thousands of your readers who belong to the principality may be able to give some clue to the origin of the myth or, if not a myth, some  cases in which the custom was practised.

Local Notes and Queries

AN EXTRAORDINARY WELSH SUPRESTITION.' —

For a good account of Welsh superstitions, I would refer "J., Stroud," to Wirt Sykes's British Goblins." Referring to the "Sin-eater," he says :—" Well-informed Welshmen have denied that any such custom as that of the Sin-eater ever existed in Wales at any time, or in the border shires; and it must not be assertej that they are wrong, unless we have convincing proof to support the assertion. The existing evidence in support of the belief that there were ones Sin- eaters in Wales I have carefully collated, and (excluding hearsay and second-hand accounts), it is here reproduced. The first reference to the Sin-eater anywhere to be found is in the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum, in the handwriting of John Aubrey, the author. It runs thus:— 'In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sin-eater over the corpse, and also a mazard bowl of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.' Aubrey adds, 'and this custom, though rarely used iu our days, yet by some people was observed in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government; as at Dynder (*nolens volens* the parson of the parish), the kindred of the woman deceased there, had this ceremony punctually performed, according to-her will: and also the like was done at the city of Hereford, in those times, where a woman kept many years before her death a mazard bowl for the Sin-eater; and the like in other places in this country as also in Brecon, e.g., at Llangors, where Mr Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this custom. I believe,' says Aubrey, 'this custom was heretofore used all over Wales.' He states further,—' A.D. 1686: This custom is used to this day in North Wales.' Upon this Bishop White Kennet made this comment:—' It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake, and one flaggoa of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church porch. No other writer of Aubrey's time, either English or Welsh, appears to have made any reference to the Sin-eater in Wales; and equal silence prevails throughout the writings of all previous centuries. Since Aubrey, many references to it have been made, but never, so far as I can discover, by any writer in the Welsh language— a singular omission, if there ever was such a custom; for, concerning every other superstitious practice commonly ascribed to Wales, the Welsh have written freely." EDITOR.

AN EXTRAORDINARY WELSH SUPERSTITION.

The great majority of your readers will have read the account of the "scapegoat" ceremony recorded in the Sacred Volume. Some, too, will remember a striking parallel custom (or, to put it more correctly, a parallel custom with a disparity) observed by the North American Indians. From goat to dog, and from dog to man, are remarkable bounds; but here is an account of a human "scapegoat" from a trustworthy authority :— "In a certain county in Wales, some years ago when a person died, his friends sent for the 'sin-eater' of the district, who, for half-a-crown, *took upon himself the sins of the deceased*, by the simple process of eating them. A loaf of bread was provided, which the 'sin-eater' first placed upon the dead man's chest, then muttered some incantations over it, finally eating it. By this he was believed to have taken from the deceased the heavy weight of his sins, appropriating them to himself, for which act of kindness he was regarded by everybody as an outcast. After the ceremony was finished, and he had received his pay, the 'sin-devourer' vanished in double-quick time, it being the usual custom for the bereaved friends to belabour him with sticks."

WELSH ECHOES FROM LONDON

Welsh Folk-Lore. The current number of Folk-Lore opens with the paper on "The Sin-Eater," read by Mr E. Sidney Hartland, of Gloucester (formerly of Swansea), before a recent meeting of the Cymmrodorion Society. It is many years since the *sin-eater* has disappeared from Wales, but if Mr Hartland's conclusions be correct many of the quaint funeral customs prevalent amongst the Welsh people were survivals of the more ancient ceremony, which, traced back to its origin, is probably the relic of a savage feast, where the meat consumed (with the object of taking over some of the properties of the dead) was the very body of the deceased kinsman. There is now little left in Wales of the funeral customs of thirty and forty years ago, and it behoves Welsh folk lorists to be diligent in completing the record. Professor Rhys, who has rendered so much valuable service to the cause of folk lore, adds some interesting notes to a previous communication on the "First foot and Allied Superstitions," in which he draws attention to the importance attached to the sex or complexion of the first person who enters the house on New Years Day, and the editor of the journal, Mr Joseph Jacobs, appeals for further information on the subject. To Dr Griffith Evans, of Bangor, folk-lorists are indebted for a contribution giving detailed statements as to certain forms of exorcism that were in use in Wales so recently as the forties. The excellent record of folk-lore Bibliography is continued.

WELSH GLEANINGS.

Mr N. W. Thomas, New College, Eastbourne, writes to the *Times* pointing out that no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the name is known. That no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived.

Courtship and Marriage, Death and Burial

...

In Hampshire the outer door of the house through which the body has been carried is left open, until the return of the mourners otherwise it is supposed that another death will occur before a year has passed away.

The funeral baked meats mentioned in Shaespeare's "Hamlet" still have their representatives in funeral biscuits which are handed round. These are small, round spnge cakes, and were formerly known as arvel bread, arvel being the ale or feast of the heir when he succees to his father's property. Probably this is connected with the custom of the sin-eater, formerly observed in Wales, and was a relic of old pagan times. A poor person was hired to perform the duties of sin-eater. Bread and beer were passed to the man over the corpse, or laid on it; these he consumed, and by this process was supposed to take upon him ail the sins of thedeceased and free the defunct person, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, from walking after death. The consumers of funeral biscuits in modern times probably do not reflect what an extraordinary custom or superstition these dainties are connected with.

This custom prevailed up to a few years ago at Market Drayton, for at a funeral there the body was brought downstairs, a short service was performed, and then glasses of wine and funeral biscuits were handed to each bearer across the coffin. The clergyman who had recently come from Pembrokeshire remarked that he was sorry to see that pagan custom sill observed, and that he had put an end to it in his former parish. At other places the current belief still exists that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased; hence wine is drunk at the funerals in order to release the soul of the dead fiom the burden of sin.
