Characterisitics of Welsh Preaching

...

In a word, it is impossible, knowing Wales as we know it in our own day, to form any very distinct idea of the country as it was when these great preachers arose ; and, when the tides of a new spiritual life rolled over the Principality, the singular relics of even heathenish superstition were loitering still among the secluded valleys and mountains of the land. No doubt, the proclamation of the Gospel, and the elevated faith which its great truths bring in its train, broke the fascination, the charm, and power of many of these ; but they lingered even until within the last forty or fifty years, — indeed, the superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Caer- marthenshire. The meaning of this most singular institution of superstition was, that when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person ; he then uttered an incantation over the bread, after which, he proceeded to eat it, — thereby eating the sins of the dead person ; this done, he received a fee of two- and-sixpence, — which, we suppose, was much more than many a preacher received for a long and painful service. Having received this, he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the de- parted aiding his exit with blows and kicks, and other indications of their faith in the service he had ren- dered. A hundred years since, and through the ages beyond that time, we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere prevalent.

Another odd custom was the manner in which public opinion expressed itself on account of any domestic or social delinquency. A large crowd assembled before the house of the delinquent, one of whom was dressed up in what seemed to be a horse's head ; the crowd then burst forth into strong vituperative abuse, accompanying the execrations with the rough music of old kettles, marrow-bones, and cleavers ; finally, the e^gy of the sinner was . burnt before the house, and the sacred wrath of the multitude appeased. The majesty of outraged opinion being vindicated, they dispersed.

In the third edition of 1888 - https://archive.org/details/christmasevansp00hooduoft/page/22/mode/2up?q=sin+eater -there is an additional footnote referring the reader to "See Note at end of Chapter, page 39." which is as follows:

*Note to "Cwm-Aman" page 23.*

Dr. Thos. Rees, in a letter to the Editor of the *Dysgedydd*, Rev. Herber Evans, says, "That although bred and born within ten miles of Cwm-Aman, he had never heard of this ridiculous superstition."
