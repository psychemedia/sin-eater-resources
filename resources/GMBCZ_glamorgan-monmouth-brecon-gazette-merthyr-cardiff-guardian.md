The forthcoming work, called "The Mountain Decameron, is likely to enrol its writer as one of the most potent masters of fiction. The scene is Wales, a land abounding in the highest materials of romance, but till now unaccountably neglected. The common nomenclature of its topography involves themes of deep mystery and overpowering interest. There is the Fynnon Waedog (Bloody Well) — the Panty Gwaye (the Hollow of Woe) — the Maen Achwynfan (the Stone of Weeping)–the Lysan Gwad Gwyr (the Plant of the Blood of Man). What terrible mysteries do these more than half unveil, and by a single name!

ROMANTIC LEGENDS OF WALES.-

A new Romance, under the title of "The Mountain Decameron", from the pen of a most original and powerful writer, has just appeared. It is remarkable, that whilst England and Scotland have found such numerous, and, in several instances, such able and delightful delineators, Wales, which has remained, more than any other portion of the Empire in its ancient state, and which abounds with so many interesting legends and traditions congenial with its picturesque and magnificent scenery rendering it the very home of romance, should hitherto have remained without illustration from the pen of the novelist. At length, however, a master of fiction has arisen, who is likely to turn to account the rich materials existing in Cambria, and to render her mountains, her lakes, her valleys, and the strongly contrasted character of her inhabitants, as well known and admired as those of Scotland, when displayed by the genius of Scott and Burns.

THE MOUNTAIN DECAMERON—

The romance thus announced will assuredly win for its author a distinguished name among English writers of fiction. The daring nature of his conceptions, and the fearless power with which he animates them, cannot fail to produce a deep impression His scene, too, Wales, is, most strange to say, nearly unbroken ground in English literature. Yet who, alive to taste or feeling, can look without intense excitement on its lone cataracts, its cloud-capt rocks, its vestiges of departed greatness, its mighty wrecks of castles breasting stormy seas, its abbeys crumbling in olive-coloured glooms, and its wild and stirring legends?

LITERARY NOTICES.

"THE MOUNTAIN DECAMERON."

These volumes contain much that is clever and original. They profess to embody in a series of Tales the popular habits, customs, superstitions, and modes of thinking of the Welsh.  We have no time for present analysis, and our extracts are taken almost at random, and have reference rather to that which is incidentally spoken, than to the staple commodity of the work.

The author laments in a note, and with some shew of justice, the indifference of the Welsh Gentry to their National Literature.

"With a thousand apologies to the *higher orders* of Welsh, it must be owned that this can the modern gentleman of Wales. The ruins that peep on his path, the dark hints of past tragic events, that, even in the common names of places, his familiar haunts, in the business of hunting and shooting, "implore the passing tribute of it in vain! The lightest, most tasteful antiquarianism, is heavy and vapid midst the excitement of the chase, or other excitements more fatal to health."

"There is in fact, and literally, *no Reading Public in Wales*, but the better educated part of the more secluded Welsh peasantry. The gentry of Wales dispute this, but they had better *disprove it*. Let them do so by attaching *some* importance to so invaluable a resource, one so innocent, so exalting so vital to good morals as *reading*. Vermin hunting might still be the *grand* resource.

"Facts are stubborn things. *Seventeen* Welsh periodicals circulate *well* among the *humbler* classes! *One*, conducted with ability—and with great sacrifice by the spirited patrons of it, to the honour of their country- *one*, acknowledged as worthy of support, by high critical authorities not Welsh— has at last *ceased to circulate for want of that support from the gentry*. Other orders, *seventeen* —the gentry *not one: verbum sat*."

[...EXCERPT...]

A few of the remaining superstitions of the Welsh are thus described:–

"The superstitions of Wales," the Doctor remarked, "form no part of the popular *poetry* of our age; yet there exist many grandly imaginative. How few know any thing about our Cum Annwn, that is'Dogs of the Sky', but which their office, as assigned, would warrant its to call the *Bloodhounds of Souls!* by earthly analogy. Sudden fires trail along the heavens at the moment of a dying person's body and soul taking leave, and that light is no other than that fire which each of that terrible pack always has following after like a chain; and sounds like the yellings of an earthly hunt, may be heard in the dumbness of midnight, and which hunting is no less than the chase of the parting soul by these fiends of the sky, as it flies towards Heaven's gate before them, the flight tor nothing less than *eternal* life or death! What superstition affecting mortal life and its brevity, and its briefer pains, can compare in terror, in wildness, or sublimity with this? with these howlings and huntings for immortal souls, these wildfires trailed by demon bloodhounds, across all the deep-blue *Chase* of the midnight heavens, and the issue of the dread hunting never revealed to the mourner, upgazing from the gate of the house of mourning? The light borne in the hand of a spirit, moving the way a corpse shall soon be borne, and called the *Canwyll Corph* —Corpse Candle — is better known and a solemn fancy is that!

"More terrible and forcible in mournful conception is the strange being that crosses the twilight path of the Welsh mountaineer, and which warns him by its mere presence, of a death in his house near at hand. The Cyoewraeth is the likeness of a woman, frightfully cadaverous of visage, bringing all the festering horror of a three weeks' burial in its grim yet not utterly disfeatured loathsomeness, abroad into the world of life, divulging the foulest secrets of the grave! This *form* stands direct in some lonesome path of the startled person, tossing her long grisly arms in the air and wringing her earthy lengths of wasted hand, and— shaking down her already worm-beset hair over her eye-holes, and their sunken dead-light fixed upon his, steady as the basilisk's on its prey, but gloomy— sets up such a cry of wild weeping, and utters two words only, so terrible i their power, that they for the moment arrest the moving blood in the veins of the hearer— the Welsh words signifying 'Oh, my wife!' or 'Oh, my husband! according to the sex of the shortlived object of its fatal forewarning."



*Annwn*— The *bottomless abyss*; *Hell*, in the ancient scuse, as the "bourn" of all spitis.

THE LAST "SIN-EATER" OF WALES. A SKETCH. (From Mr Downes' Mountain-Decameron.)

So late as the earlier part of the last century, that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of "The Sin-Eater," was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, who, (unless we suppose him an unbeliever)- being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confessions during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his already laden soul.

Mr Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom, (but I have an idea by Mr Kyrle, the "Man of Ross,") which describes a "Sin-Eater," who "lived by Ross highway," and is described as a gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal."

If we consider these persons as probably not less believers than those who employed them, it is not easy to imagine a condition of the mind more terrific, desolate, and desperate, than theirs; thus more and more removed from the hope of mercy with every death, and assurance of perdition doubly sure.

A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last "Sin-Eater of Wales".

"I got lost," says he, "near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was to gain that between Penyboat village and Machynlleth town. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy morass, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits -the whole being a quaking morass. In truth its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse. It forms a great brown-black triangle of land, without a tree, or any vegetation but patches of gorse. Yet the piles of *mawn*, (all fetched a way by persons on foot) diversified the dismalness with a sort of low walls, and between was gleaming of some water, from the many holes whence it is dug. Till the moon went down, which lit me a space, I could just distinguish these dismal pools and cuts like canals, by its glimmer. I never saw ought so dismal in my own country as this great turbarv of hollow ground looked, a huge green-roofed pit, the pitchy mud thus betraying itself every where, as the large moon, looking red as blood in a foul fog stagnating all over it, took leave of it, and its brown grew browner, and that browner black, till the last to be seen was one horrid blackness, where nothing lived, and nothing was heard but the low roar of the sea washing it on two sides, like the hum of some great city. That deep-voiced murmur of the sea so sounding like a thousand voices, made it more shocking to look upon, the space between, as dumb as a great grave. More than once I thought a light glimmered in the very midst, but I took it for the Jack-a-lantern, if not something worse, for I had heard of Wreckers, and there had been a shipwreck, the weather wild, and even the day had been hardly light.

"At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a pleasant cottage taper instead of that will-o'-wisp of the black bog, which was as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, the corpse-candle, carried by a figure of one (as these Welsh say,) whose own burial will soon take place, in the spot it vanishes at. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office-that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the Cross, and then praying for a transfer of whatever pains or penances in fire or "thick-ribbed ice," or molten lead, or what beside monastic belief attached to the perdition of tormented souls, from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever."

This is the traveller's account of this incident.

He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road's point the straw of her husband's late bed—the usual signal of a death in the house.

The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dared by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse. One curious belief was current, that he was no other than "The Wandering Jew"— the man who spit on his Saviour, and cannot die—that fable familiar to so many countries.

SIN-EATER.

—Can any of your readers explain the origin of "the sin-eater," and give instances of that horrible practice still subsisting in parts of England and Wales, as I am assured it does? It consists in the supposed transfer of the sins of a person recently dead to a man of reprobate character, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have relieved the dead man from the responsibility of his sins, amd to have it on himself; he crown for his services, and is driven or pursued from the house with execration. This practice was the subject of an interesting paper by Mr. Moggridge of Swansea at the last annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association; but its origin was not satisfactorily traced. The scapegoat, and the sacrifice of criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been suggested. —JELINGER. C. SYMONS. [The custom is generally supposed to have been taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi. 21, 22. See a curious passage from Lansdown MSS. concerning a sin-eater who lived in a cottage on the Ross high way in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand's Antiquities, vol. ii, p. 247, edit.1849] -Notes and Queries.

"BUNDLING" IN WALES.

Mr. Charles Jeffreys, a gentleman residing at Gwyn- fryn, near Aberystwith, was charged before Judge Johnes, at the County Court, with violently assaulting Evan Williams and Evan Jenkins, farm servants of Tre'ddol. The damages laid were £50 in each case. Mr. W. S. Crealock appeared for the plaintiffs, and Mr. F. Roberts for the defence. The case of Evan Williams was first taken. Mr. Crealock, in opening the case, stated the facts. Evan Williams, the plaintiff, was courting one of the servants at Gwynfryn named Sarah Williams, and by her invitation went there on the evening of the 3rd of May., according to a custom of the country called "bundling." He arrived there with a friend, Evan Jenkins, and after taking their boots off in the wash- house, both were conducted upstairs to the maid- servants' bedroom. The time was then between half- past eight and nine o'clock in the evening. They re- mained there some time undisturbed, in the society of the maids. About two o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Jeffreys hearing a noise, awoke her husband, who came upstairs armed with a formidable club, with which he beat the plaintiff and his friend most unmercifully, as they would hear by the evidence, They ran down to the kitchen, where Mr. Jeffreys, who had been all the time belabouring them with the stick, threw it on the table, tucked up his sleeves, and struck the plaintiff four or five times. He then let them out through the front door. They would be told in evidence that blood was found on Mr. Jeffreys' nightdress, and spots of blood were sprinkled on a china candlestick, which was held by a Mr. Trueman, who was a visitor at Mr. Jeffreys'. After they were turned out, they walked three miles without shoes, having been unable to put them on; however, by helping one another they got them on, and reached home at seven o'clock in the morning. They had been attended by Dr. Rowlands, of Goginan, and had been unable to do any work. He thought Mr. Jeffreys ought to be thankful he was brought up at that court and not taken to the assizes. He would now call the plaintiff. Evan Williams said he was a farm servant at Neuadd yr Yuis, near Talybont. Was acquainted with one of the servants of Mr. Jeffreys previous to last May. Her name was Sarah Williams. Went to Gwynfryn on the 3rd of May, upon her invitation, taking with him a friend, named Evan Jenkins. When they got to the gate Eliza Jones, the cook, met them and told them to go into the wash-house and take their boots off, as there was a man-servant at his supper in the house, but whom she would get away. She went out with the man-servant, and Ellen Jones, another servant, came and showed them the way into the bedroom. At about half-past 9 the three girls were in the room. The candle was then put out. Witness and Sarah Williams then lay down on one of the beds. He had taken his coat off. Some time in the morning he was informed Mrs. Jeffreys was coming up stairs. He had fallen asleep, and therefore did not hear her himself. Heard her leave the room and go to the top of the stairs and call out "Charley, Charley." Witness then jumped out of bed and put on his hat and coat, and went to the door with the intention of leaving. He opened the door and saw Mr. Jeffreys coming up stairs with a stick across his shoulder. Witness touched his fore-lock and said, Beg your pardon, sir." Mr. Jeffreys said, I will kill you," and struck him (witness) across the nose with the stick, which broke the bone of his nose. He fell back against the washhand-sfand. He then got up and went down stairs. Received several blows when going down one on the neck, and another severe one on the arm. Could hardly say what took place when they got into the kitchen, as he was nearly insensible. Mr. Trueman and Evan Jenkins were, however, present. Showed Mr. Jeffreys the blood running from his face, and begged him to desist. They were then both turned out of the front door by Mr. Jeffreys. When he reached home sent for Mr. Hughes, Dr. Rowland's assist- ant, who said that it was such a serious affair that he must send for him (Dr. Rowlands). Had not resumed work, as he was unable to use his arm and hand. His head and back were also affected. Cross-examined by Mr. Rowlands Was 23 years old, and had made up his mind to marry Sarah Wil- liams. Did not know her intimately previous to the evening of the assault. Had never amused himself with Sarah Williams before. She was the only one to whom he had been paying his addresses this summer. Had promised to marry her the night he received the beating. Went to Mr. Crealock on the Friday follow- ing. The amount of damages was left to him and Dr. Rowlands. Did not know why they had been laid at £50. His Honour: To bring the case within the juris- diction of the County Court, I suppose. Mr. Crealock You are right, your Honour. Examination continued: Dr. Rowlands had in- serted instruments and raised the sunken bones of his nose. His wages were .£14 10s. per annum. Be- longed to a club, but had been told that no amount could be given except in cases of sickness. Had made no preparatory agreement with Mr. Crealock respecting the amount he was to be paid. Evan Jenkins deposed that when Mr. Jeffreys was in the kitchen he threw the stick with which he had struck them on the table, and, stepping back a few paces, ran at Evan Williams, striking him on the side of the nose. Saw blood on Mr. Jeffreys' fist. Evan Williams did not oppose him in any way. Ellen Jones said she was housemaid at Gwynfryn. Remembered Mr. Jeffreys coming up to their room on the morning of the 14th of May inst. Heard Evan Williams ask Mr. Jeffreys' pardon, and saw Mr. Jeffreys strike him. Next morning had occasion to put away her master's night-dress, and noticed it was sprinkled with blood half-way up the elbow. There was also a white china candlestick stained in the same manner. Cross-examined Was dismissed from Gwynfryn immediately after the occurrence. Resided now at Ruthin, in Denbighshire. Sarah Williams and Mr. Hughes, the assistant to Dr. Rowlands, were next examined, but the evidence was not very important. Dr. Rowlands said he was a surgeon, residing at Goginau. Was called to attend Evan Wliliams on the 4th of May last. Found he had a small fracture of the left side of his nose, with an abrasion of the skin on the left side of his face. He had a disloca- tion of the thumb on the left hand, and several bruises about the shoulder and elbow, and the left eye was swollen and discoloured. Reduced the frac- ture of the nose, to which instruments had to be ap- plied, and also the dislocation of the thumb. They had not hitherto been in a fit condition to work. If the blow on the nose had descended on the forehead, it would probably have resulted in inflammation of the brain. He was not permanently injured. This closed the plaintiff's case. Mr. Roberts proposed examining his witnesses before addressing the court. Mr. Chas. Jeffreys was then examined, and said I am the defendant in this action. I was awakened by Mrs. Jeffreys on the early morning of the 4th of May. I got up, fancying some men were talking to the ser- vants through the window. Finding nothing, I returned into the house, on the way arming myself with a stick. I went upstairs and found the two men there. Did not strike them in the bedroom. Sent them downstairs, I following and striking at them with the club, holding it in the middle. I put the club on the kitchen table, and struck the plaintiff twice or thrice with my fist. When going downstairs they had their backs to me it was, therefore, impossible for me to have struck Evan Williams on the face. Saw blood on his face after I struck him with my fist in the kitchen, but saw no pool of blood in the kitchen. I then let them out through the front door. Cross-examined by Mr. Crealock I persist in my assertion that I did not strike a blow in the bedroom. Did not enter the room at all, but opened the door for them to come out. Plaintiff made use of the words Beg your pardon, sir," and said they meant no harm. I answered, Bundle out of this," or something to that effect. Did not say that I would kill them, but might have said I might possibly have shot them, by taking them for house-breakers. I did strike Evan Williams (the plaintiff) after he came out of the bedroom. Struck him with the stick produced. fThe stick or club had apparently been a part of the back of a chair, and was about a yard in length.] Held it about a foot off the end. Mr. Crealock Do you not think that when the stick was held a little off the end it would produce a severer blow, for if it was held at the end it would be slightly top-heavy ?—I should say not. Mr. Crealock You have been to New Zealand, haven't you ?—Yes. And know what a Maori club is, I suppose ?—Yes. It is nothing like that (pointing to the stick). lou know that a Maori club must be held in a pecu- liar fashion to produce an effect ?—Yes. Isn't it so with this?—I do not know. Was your night-dress sprinkled with blood? —Yes a few drops here and there. Do you think it must have been a severe blow on the nose before the blood would have sprinkled about. I do not know. It was similar to that delivered when two little boys are fighting in the street. I walked them out as soon as I had done with them. Did not lay bold of one of the men by the collar and drag him out of the corner. Would not swear that I did not strike Evan Williams four times with my fist after had placed the club on the table. Mr. Irueman was holding the candle. Never heard anything of the blood seen on the premises until now. His Honour Do I understand you to say you struck them after they begged your pardon? Witness I was striking them all down the stairs, and until they got into the corner of the kitchen. The Rev. Mr. Trueman was next examined, and gave corroborative evidence. In cross-examination he said neither of the men showed the slightest sign of fight- ing, but appeared too frightened. It was impossible for blood to fly upon the china candlestick which he held in his hand as he was too far distant. Mr. F. Roberts then addressed the jury in defence, and throughout he was much applauded, notwith- standing the repeated calls for silence. He maintained that an Englishman's house was his castle, and that Mr. Jeffreys was right in using violence towards the plaintiff, although it might have been rather severe. He also denounced the practice of courting, or bund- ling, as being the stepping-stone to seduction, illegiti- macy, and disgrace. After a brilliant peroration, in which he described a fourpenny-piece as being suffi- cient damages, he sat down amid cheers. Mr, Crealock summed up the evidence on the whole case. He denounced the practice as an uncivilized one, but considered the violence used was unjustifiable. Mr. Jeffreys knew the custom of the country, as it was called, and yet, without receiving any opposition from the men, assaulted them in a barbarous fashion. He agreed with his learned friend as regarded the immo- rality of the proceeding, but they (the jury) had not to decide upon that question, but the one of assault. His Honour then charged the jury. He strongly condemned the practice of courting, as it was called, and which he had hoped had been stamped out. The provocation was great, but he pointed out that there were but two instances in which a man was entitled to take the law into his own hands one was in self- defence, and the other was when a person was caught in direct violation of domestic sanctity. He thought the claim of £ 50 absurd, but said there must be some damages. He advised them to take into consideration what damages they would have given if the provoca- tion had not been so great, and to make a reasonable deduction for the provocation given in this case. The jury, after an absence of about a quarter of an hour, returned with a verdict of damages £ 15. Costs allowed. The case of Evan Jenkins was then gone into, and damages of 1;11 were awarded with the costs. The first case, which lasted about five hours, was watched throughout the day with intense interest, and the court was crowded. A little surprise was evinced at the amount of damages, many sympathising with the defendant.
