The forthcoming work, called "The Mountain Decameron, is likely to enrol its writer as one of the most potent masters of fiction. The scene is Wales, a land abounding in the highest materials of romance, but till now unaccountably neglected. The common nomenclature of its topography involves themes of deep mystery and overpowering interest. There is the Fynnon Waedog (Bloody Well) — the Panty Gwaye (the Hollow of Woe) — the Maen Achwynfan (the Stone of Weeping)–the Lysan Gwad Gwyr (the Plant of the Blood of Man). What terrible mysteries do these more than half unveil, and by a single name!

ROMANTIC LEGENDS OF WALES.-

A new Romance, under the title of "The Mountain Decameron", from the pen of a most original and powerful writer, has just appeared. It is remarkable, that whilst England and Scotland have found such numerous, and, in several instances, such able and delightful delineators, Wales, which has remained, more than any other portion of the Empire in its ancient state, and which abounds with so many interesting legends and traditions congenial with its picturesque and magnificent scenery rendering it the very home of romance, should hitherto have remained without illustration from the pen of the novelist. At length, however, a master of fiction has arisen, who is likely to turn to account the rich materials existing in Cambria, and to render her mountains, her lakes, her valleys, and the strongly contrasted character of her inhabitants, as well known and admired as those of Scotland, when displayed by the genius of Scott and Burns.

THE MOUNTAIN DECAMERON—

The romance thus announced will assuredly win for its author a distinguished name among English writers of fiction. The daring nature of his conceptions, and the fearless power with which he animates them, cannot fail to produce a deep impression His scene, too, Wales, is, most strange to say, nearly unbroken ground in English literature. Yet who, alive to taste or feeling, can look without intense excitement on its lone cataracts, its cloud-capt rocks, its vestiges of departed greatness, its mighty wrecks of castles breasting stormy seas, its abbeys crumbling in olive-coloured glooms, and its wild and stirring legends?

LITERARY NOTICES.

"THE MOUNTAIN DECAMERON."

These volumes contain much that is clever and original. They profess to embody in a series of Tales the poppular habits, customs, superstitions, and modes of thinking of the Welsh.  We have no t;me for present analysis, and our extracts are taken almost at random, and have reference rather to that which is incidentally spoken, than to the staple commodity of the work.

The author laments in a note, and with some shew of justice, the indifference of the Welsh Gentry to their National Literature.

"With a thousand apologies to the *higher orders* of Welsh, it must be owned that this can the modern gentleman of Wales. The ruins that peep on his path, the dark hints of past tragic events, that, even in the common names of places, his familiar haunts, in the business of hunting and shooting, "implore the passing tribute of it in vain! The lightest, most tasteful antiquarianism, is heavy and vapid midst the excitement of the chase, or other excitements more fatal to health."

"There is in fact, and literally, *no Reading Public in Wales*, but the better educated part of the more secluded Welsh peasantry. The gentry of Wales dispute this, but they had better *disprove it*. Let them do so by attaching *some* importance to so invaluable a resource, one so innocent, so exalting so vital to good morals as *reading*. Vermin hunting might still be the *grand* resource.

"Facts are stubborn things. *Seventeen* Welsh periodicals circulate *well* among the *humbler* classes! *One*, conducted with ability—and with great sacrifice by the spirited patrons of it, to the honour of their country- *one*, acknowledged as worthy of support, by high critical authorities not Welsh— has at last *ceased to circulate for want of that support from the gentry*. Other orders, *seventeen* —the gentry *not one: verbum sat*."

[...EXCERPT...]

A few of the remaining superstitions of the Welsh are thus described:–

"The superstitions of Wales," the Doctor remarked, "form no part of the popular *poetry* of our age; yet there exist many grandly imaginative. How few know any thing about our Cum Annwn,that is'Dogs of the Sky', but which their office, as assigned, would warrant its to call the *Bloodhounds of Souls!* by earthly analogy. Sudden fires trail along the heavens at the moment of a dying person's body and soul taking leave, and that light is no other than that fire which each of that terrible pack always has following after like a chain; and sounds like the yellings of an earthly hunt, may be heard in the dumbness of midnight, and which hunting is no less than the chase of the parting soul by these fiends of the sky, as it flies towards Heaven's gate before them, the flight tor nothing less than *eternal* life or death! What superstition affecting mortal life and its brevity, and its briefer pains, can compare in terror, in wildness, or sublimity with this? with these howlings and huntings for immortal souls, these wildfires trailed by demon bloodhounds, across all the deep-blue *Chase* of the midnight heavens, and the issue of the dread hunting never revealed to the mourner, upgazing from the gate of the house of mourning ? The light borne in the hand of a spirit, moving the way a corpse shall soon be borne, and called the *Canwyll Corph* —Corpse Candle — is better known and a solemn fancy is that!

"More terrible and forcible in mournful conception is the strange being that crosses the twilight path of the Welsh mountaineer, and which warns him by its mere presence, of a death in his house near at hand. The Cyoeuraeth is the like- ness of a woman, frightfully cadaverous of visage, bringing all the festering horror of a three weeks' burial in its grim yet not utterly disfeatured loathsomeness, abroad into the world of life, divilulging the foulest secrets of the grave! This *form* stands direct in some lonesome path of the startled person, tossing her long grisly arms in the air and wringing her earthy lengths of wasted hand, and— shaking down her already worm-beset hair over her eye-holes, and their sunken dead-light fixed upon his, steady as the basilisk's on its prey, but gloomy— sets up such a cry of wild weeping, and utters two words only, so terrible i their power, that theyfor the moment arrest the moving blood in the veins of the hearer— the Welsh words signifying 'Oh, my wife!' or 'Oh, my husband! according to the sex of the shortlived object of its fatal forewarning."



*Annwn*— The *bottomless abyss*; *Hell*, in the ancient scuse, as the "bourn" of all spitis.

THE LAST "SIN-EATER" OF WALES. A SKETCH. (From Mr Downes' Mountain-Decameron.)

So late as the earlier part of the last century, that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of "The Sin-Eater," was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, wno, (unless we suppose him an unbeliever)- being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confessions during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to bo imposed on his already laden soul.

Mr Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget bv whom, (but I have an idea by Mr Kyrle, the Man of Ross,") which describes a "Sin-Eater," who "lived by Ross highway," and is described as a gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal."

If we consider these persons as probably not less believers than those who employed them, it is not easy to imagine a condition of the mind more terrific, desolate, and desperate, than theirs; thus more and more removed from the hope of mercy with every death, and assurance of perdition doubly sure.

A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last "Sin-Eater of Wales".

"I got lost," savs he, "near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was to gain that between Penyboat village and Machynlleth town. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy morass, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits -the whole being a quaking morass. In truth its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of eing swallowed, man and horse. It forms a great brown-black triangle of land, without a tree, or any vegetation but patches of gorse. Yet the piles of *mawn*, (all fetched a way by persons on foot) diversified the dismalness with a sort of low walls, and between was gleaming of some water, from the many holes whence it is dug. Till the moon went down, which lit me a space, I could just distinguish these dismal pools and cuts like canals, by its glimmer. I never saw ought so dismal in mv own country as this great turbarv of hollow ground looked, a huge green-roofed pit, the pitchy mud thus betraying itself every where, as the large moon, looking red as blood in a foul fog stagnating all over it, took leave of it, and its brown grew browner, and that browner black, till the last to be seen was one horrid blackness, where nothing lived, and nothing was heard but the low roar of the sea washing it on two sides, like the hum of some great city. That deep-voiced murmur of the sea so sounding like a thousand voices, made it more shocking to look upon, the space between, as dumb as a great grave. More than once I thought a light glimmered in the very midst, but I took it for the Jack-a-lantern, if not something worse, for I had heard of Wreckers, and there had been a shipwreck, the weather wild, and even the day had been hardly light.

"At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a pleasant cottage taper instead of that will-o'-wisp of the black bog, which was as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, the corpse-candle, carried by a figure of one (as these Welsh say,) whose own burial will soon take place, in the spot it vanishes at. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office-that is, to cat the bl'ead, lav hi hand on tbe. dead breast, place the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the Cross, and then praying for a transfer of whatever pains or penances in fire or "thick-ribbed ice," or molten lead, or what beside monastic belief attached to the perdition of tormented souls, from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever."

This is the traveller's account of this incident.

He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road's point the straw of her husband's late bed—the usual signal of a death in the house.

The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach bv day, none dared by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse. One curious belief was current, that he was no other than "The Wandering Jew"— the man who spit on his Saviour, and cannot die—that fable familiar to so many countries.

SIN-EATER.—Can any of your readers explain the origin of "the sin-eater," and give instances of that horrible practice still subsisting in parts of England and Wales, as I am assured it does? It consists in the supposed transfer of the sins of a person recently dead to a man of reprobate character, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have relieved the dead man from the responsibility of his sins, amd to have it on himself; he crown for his services, and is driven or pursued from the house with execration. This practice was the subject of an interesting paper by Mr. Moggridge of Swansea at the last annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association; but its origin was not satisfactorily traced. The scapegoat, and the sacrifice of criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been suggested. —JELINGER. C. SYMONS. [The custom is generally supposed to have been taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi. 21, 22. See a curious passage from Lansdown MSS. concerning a sin-eater who lived in a cottage on the Ross high way in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand's Antiquities, vol. ii, p. 247, edit.1849] -Notes and Queries.
