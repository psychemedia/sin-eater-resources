>NOTES AND QUERIES.
>
> THE nature and design of the present work have been so fully stated in the Prospectus, and are indeed so far explained by its very Title, that it is unnecessary to occupy any great portion of its first number with details on the subject. We are under no temptation to fill its columns with an account of what we hope future numbers will be. Indeed, we would rather give a specimen than a description ; and only regret that, from the wide range of subjects which it is intended to embrace, and the correspondence and contributions of various kinds which we are led to expect, even this can only be done gradually. A few words of introduction and explanation may, however, be allowed ; and, indeed, ought to be prefixed, that we may be understood,.by those readers who have not seen our Prospectus.

"WHEN FOUND, MAKE A NOTE OF," is a most admirable rule ; and if the excellent Captain had never uttered another word, he might have passed for a profound philosopher. It is a rule which should shine in gilt letters on the gingerbread of youth, and the spectacle-case of age. Every man who reads with any view beyond mere pastime, knows the value of it. Every one, more or less, acts upon it. Every one regrets and suffers who neglects it. There is some trouble in it, to be sure ; but in what good thing is there not ? and what trouble does it save ! Nay, what mischief! Half the lies that are current in the world owe their origin to a misplaced confidence in memory, rather than to intentional falsehood. We have never known more than one man who could deliberately and conscientiously say that his memory had *never* deceived him ; and he (when he saw that he had excited the surprise of his hearers, especially those who knew how many years he had spent in the management of important commercial affairs) used to add, — because he had never trusted it ; but had uniformly written down what he was anxious to remember.

But, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that reading and writing men, of moderate industry, who act on this rule for any considerable length of time, will accumulate a good deal of matter in various forms, shapes, and sizes — some more, some less legible and intelligible — some unposted in old pocket books — some on whole or half sheets, or mere scraps of paper, and backs of letters — some, lost sight of and forgotten, stuffing out old portfolios, or getting smoky edges in bundles tied up with faded tape. There are, we are quite sure, countless boxes and drawers, and pigeon-holes of such things, which want looking over, and would well repay the trouble. Nay, we are sure that the proprietors would find themselves much benefited even if we were to do nothing more than to induce them to look over their own collections. How much good might we have done (as well as got, for we do not pretend to speak quite disinterestedly), if we had had the looking over and methodizing of the chaos in which Mr. Oldbuck found himself just at the moment, so agonizing to an author, when he knows that the patience of his victim is oozing away, and fears it will be quite gone before he can lay his hand on the charm which is to fix him a hopeless listener: — "So saying, the Antiquary opened a drawer, and began rummaging among a quantity of miscellaneous papers, ancient and modern. But it was the misfortune of this learned gentleman, as it may be that of many learned and unlearned, that he frequently experienced on such occasions, what Harlequin calls *l'embarras des richesses* — in other words, the abundance of his collection often prevented him from finding the article he sought for." We need not add that this unsuccessful search, for Professor MacCribb's epistle, and the scroll of the Antiquary's answer, was the unfortunate turning-point on which the very existence of the documents depended, and that from that day to this nobody has seen them, or known where to look for them.

But we hope for more extensive and important benefits, than these from furnishing a medium by which much valuable information may become a sort of common property among those who can appreciate and use it. We do not anticipate any holding back by those whose " NOTES" are most worth having, or any want of "QUERIES" from those best able to answer them. Whatever may be the case in other things, it is certain that those who are best informed are generally the most ready to communicate knowledge and to confess ignorance, to feel the value of such a work as we are attempting, and to understand that if it is to be well done they y must help to do it. Some cheap and frequent means for the interchange of thought s certainly wanted by those who are engaged n literature, art, and science, and we only lope to persuade the best men in all, that we offer them the best medium of communication with each other.

By this time, we hope, our readers are prepared to admit that our title (always one of ,he most difficult points of a book to settle), las not been imprudently or unwisely adopted. We wish to bring together the ideas and the wants, not merely of men engaged in the same lines of action or inquiry, but also (and very particularly) of those who are going diferent ways, and only meet at the crossings, where a helping hand is oftenest needed, and they would be happy to give one if they knew it was wanted. In this way we desire that our little book should take "NOTES," and be a medley of all that men are doing — that the Notes of the writer and the reader, whatever be the subject-matter of his studies, of the antiquary, and the artist, the man of science, the historian, the herald, and the ge- nealogist, in short, Notes relating to all subjects but such as are, in popular discourse, termed either political or polemical, should meet in our columns in such juxta-position, as to give fair play to any natural attraction or repulsion between them, and so that if there are any hooks and eyes among them, they may catch each other.

Now, with all modesty, we submit, that for the title of such a work as we have in view, and have endeavoured to describe, no word could be so proper as "NOTES." Can any man, in his wildest dream of imagination, conceive of any thing that may not be — nay, that has not been — treated of in a note ? Thousands of things there are, no doubt, which cannot be sublimed into poetry, or elevated into history, or treated of with dignity, in a stilted text of any kind, and which are, as it is, called, "thrown" into notes; but, after all, they are much like children sent out of the stiff drawing-room into the nursery, snubbed to be sure by the act, but joyful in the freedom of banishment. We were going to say (but it might sound vain-glorious), where do things read so well as in notes ? but we will put the question in another form : — Where do you so well test an author's learning and knowledge of his subject ? — where do you find the pith of his most elaborate researches?— where do his most original suggestions escape ? — where do you meet with the details that fix your attention at the time and cling to your memory for ever? — where do both writer and reader luxuriate so much at their ease, andfeel that they are wisely discursive? But if we pursue this idea, it will be scarcely possible to avoid something which might look like self-praise ; and we content ourselves for the present with expressing our humble conviction that we are doing a service to writers and readers, by calling forth materials which they have themselves thought worth notice, but which, for want of elaboration, and the "little leisure" that has not yet come, are lying, and may lie for ever, unnoticed by others, and presenting them in an unadorned *multum-in-parvo* form. To our readers therefore who are seeking for Truth, we repeat "When found make a NOTE of;" and we must add, "till then make a QUERY."

MAZER WOOD : GUTTA PERCHA.

In the *Musaeum Tradescantianum, or a Collection of Rarities preserved at South Lambeth, near London*, by John Tradescant, 1656, I find, amongst "other variety of rarities," "the plyable Mazer wood, which, being warmed in water, will work to any form;" and a little farther on, in the list of "utensils and household stufFe," I also find "Mazer dishes." In my opinion, it is more than a coincidence that Doctor Montgomery, who, in 1843, received the gold medal of the Society of Arts for bringing gutta percha and its useful properties
under tiie notice of that bodv, describes it in almost the same words that Tradescant uses when speaking of the jiliable Mazer wood: the Doctor says, "it could be moulded into any form by merely dipping it into boiling water." It is worthy of remark that Tradescant, who was the first botanist of his day, seems to have been uncertain of the true nature of the " Mazer wood," for he does not class it with his "gums, rootes, woods ;" but, as before observed, in a heterogeneous collection which he styles "other variety of rarities." Presuming, as I do, that this Mazer wood was what we now term gutta percha, the question may be prepounded, how could Tradescant have procured it from its remote *locale*? The answer is easy. In another part of the *Musaeum Tradescantianum* may be found a list of the "benefactors" to the collection; and amongst their names occurs that of William Curteen, Esq. Now this William Curteen and his father Sir William, of Flemish descent, were the most extensive British merchants of the time, and had not only ships trading to, but also possessed forts and factories on, some of the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, the native *habitat* of thee sapotaceous tree that yields the gutta percha. Curteen was a collector of curiosities himself, and no doubt his captains and agents were instructed to procure such : in short, a specimen of gutta percha was just as likely to attract the attention of an intelligent Englishman at Amboyna in the fifteenth century, as it did at Singapore in the nineteenth.

If there are still any remains of Tradescant's collection in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, the question, whether the Mazer wood was gutta percha or not, might be soon set at rest ; but it is highly probable that the men who ordered the relics of the Dodo to be thrown out, showed but little ceremony to the Mazer wood or dishes.

A curious instance of a word, not very dissimilar to Mazer, may be found in Eric Red's Saga, part of the *Flatö Annals*, supposed to be written in the tenth century, and one of the authorities for the pre-Columbian discovery of America by the Icelanders. Karlsefne, one of the heroes of the Saga, while his ship was detained by a contrary wind in a Norwegian port, was accosted by a German, who wished to purchase his, Karlsefne's, broom.

"'I will not sell it,' said Karlsefne. 'I will give you half a mark in gold for it,' said the German man. Karlsefne thought this a good offer, and thereupon concluded the bargain. The German man went away with the broom. Karlsefne did not know what wood it was ; but it was *Maesur*, which had come from Wineland!"

Perhaps some reader may give an instance of Mazer wood being mentioned by other writers ; or inform me if the word Mazer, in itself, had any peculiar signification.

W. Pinkerton.

Mazer Wood (Vol. iii., p. 239.). — The Querist asks, "Has the word Mazer any signification in itself?"

It is used to signify a cup. Vide Walter Scott's *Lord of the Isles*, where Robert Bruce is speaking:

"Bring here, he said, the Mazers four, 
My noble fathers loved of yore."

And it is probably derived from the Irish " Maeddher," a standing cup, generally of *wood*, of a quadrangular form, with a handle on each of the sides. The puzzle was how to drink out of it, which was done from the angles. A silver " Maeddher" was presented to Lord Townshend when leaving Ireland, who puzzled many of his English friends by placing it before them filled with claret. Uninitiated persons usually attempted to drink from the flat side, and poured the wine over their clothes. I think another was presented to Lord 
Normanby when in Ireland. We see *gutta percha* cups and buckets everywhere now-a days. Perhaps such an utensil might have been among the dishes, &c. mentioned in the Catalogue of the Tradescant Museum.

Mazer Wood (Vol. iii., pp. 239. 288 ). — Your Querist asks, "Has the word Mazer any signification in itself?" It signifies *Maple*, being a corruption of the Welsh word *Masarn* — the maple-tree. Probably, therefore, the use of the wood of the maple tor bowls and drinking-cups prevailed in this country many centuries before the times of Spenser and Chaucer, in whose works they are mentioned. In Devonshire the black cherry-tree, which grows to a large size in that county, is called the mazer-tree. From this circumstance I conjecture that this wood has been used there in former times for bowls and drinking-cups as a substitute for maple. That the original word, mazer, should have been retained, is not to be wondered at. It is known that when the *mazer* bowl was made of silver, the old name was retained. The name of the maple-tree, in the Irish language, is *crann-mhalpais*; therefore the name of the Irish wooden drinking-cup *maedher* cannot be derived from it.

Mazer Wood and Sin-eaters (Vol. iii., pp. 239. 288.).— The following extract from Hone’s Year Book, p.858., will add to the explanation furnished by S.S.S., and will also give an instance of the singular practices which prevailed among our ancestors:–

"Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum are statements in Aubrey’s own handwriting to this purport. In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals, to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable, poor rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead."

Perhaps some of your readers may be able to throw some light on this curious practice of sin-eating, or on the existence of regular sin-eaters.

Minor Queries Answered

Sin-eater. — Can any of your readers explain the origin of "the sin-eater," and give instances of that horrid practice still subsisting in parts of England or Wales, as I am assured it does? It consists in the supposed transfer of the sins of a person recently dead to a man of reprobate character, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have released the dead man from the responsibility of his sins, and to have taken it on himself; he then receives half-a-crown for his services, and is driven or pursued from the house with execration.

This practice was the subject of an interesting paper by Mr. Muggridge of Swansea, at the last annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association ; but its origin was not satisfactorily traced. The scapegoat, and the sacrifice of criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been suggested. Jelinger C. Symons.

[The custom is generally supposed to have been taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi. 21, 22. See a curious passage from the Lansdown MSS. concerning a sin-eater who lived in a cottage on the Rosse highway in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand’s Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 247., edit. 1849.]

THE SIN-EATER.

(Vol. vi., p. 390.)

In addition to your reference to the scape-goat, as accounting for the custom to which JELINGER C. SYMONS refers, it occurs to me that Hosea iv. 8. might be also quoted: "They *eat up the sin* of my people." "They eat up," that is, "the sin-offering of my people." As the priest of old, by eating the sin-offering, declared in the clearest way that the sins of the guilty offerer *had* been transferred to the victim that was offered, so in some sort it came to be believed by superstitious persons, that the eating a piece of bread which had been taken off the body of a dead man, and offered to another in his behalf, transferred the sins of the deceased to the eater of the bread. Perhaps indeed the practice referred to may be rather traced up to the one great sin-offering of Him who was "made sin" for us, and who "took *bread*," the night He was betrayed at the institution of the Eucharist. "The *bread*" became the representative of the victim on Calvary ; and from the *sin-offering-eater*, or "sin-eater," being a regularly ordained priest — who might, for a consideration, say a mass for the *dead*, —laymen of "reprobate character" usurped his priestly functions, and took that honour to themselves. Some notion at least of the *feast upon a sacrifice* seems to be implied by the proceeding ” referred to by your correspondent.

ALEXANDER LEEPER.

Dublin.


In Whitby and Doddridge there is a note on 1 Cor. iv. 13. which gives some information on this subject. Whitby, from *Phavorinus*, states the custom referred to to be an Athenian one; but I see, in Pole’s *Synopsis*, that Grotius, in a note on the above passage, refers to Caesar, lib. vi., in proof that a custom of the same kind prevailed among the Gauls. See also Bos, *Exercit. Philolog.*, p. 125., to whom Doddridge refers.

The Sin-Eater.—

This odd term, with the explanation (quoted in Brand’s Antiquities), recently turned up in a newspaper article advocating "funeral reform":—

"Our good friend the opulent cheesemonger, or our other good friend the wealthy drysalter, is interred with ceremonies befitting a baron. Says an authority on the subject :— 'The mutes who stand at the door represent the two porters of the castle, with their staves in black ; the man who heads the procession, wearing a scarf, is the herald-at-arms ; the man who carries the plume of feathers on his head is an esquire, who bears the shield and casque with its plume (of feathers) ; the pall-bearers, with batons, represent the knight companions-at-arms ; and the men walking with wands the gentlemen ushers’; and so on throughout the rest of the performance. There are, however, distinct indications of revolt against this absurdity, and much beside that pertains to the burial of the dead. We have won the right of being buried with or without Church sanction in consecrated or unconsecrated ground, and with entire liberty as to the sort of service to be adopted on the occasion. Those who desire it can have the attendance of a priest at the grave, but he is no more indispensable than a sin-eater. 'And what,' the reader asks, 'is a sin-eater?' Well, he is not a person easy to find in these days, but followed an indispensable occupation in the past. He was generally an old man, the Pariah of a village, who, before every funeral, went and stood at the door of the house, where was given him a sixpence, a loaf of bread, and a wooden bowl of beer or milk. And as the coffin passed out, he ate the bread and swallowed the draught, and in so doing took upon himeelf the sins of the departed, and went his way. We are well rid of the sin-eater, who throve in the last century ; but there still linger around us customs and usages hardly less preposterous."

Tne Sin-Eater (5th S. vi. 505.)—

Mr. Watson may perhaps not be aware of very curious or almost identical parallel to this Yorkshire religious ceremony, superstition, or whatever it may be called, in the book on Turkistan recently published by Mr. Schuyler. He found it, if I remember right, among the Mussulmans of Khokand as a regular part of their religious observances.

THe CORPSE CANDLE

The belief in the appearance of the corpse candle in Wales has not yet died out. Having occasion to visit this part of Wales, which, by the way, is in many particulars one of the most interesting spots in Caermarthenshire, I found a valuable "subject" for folklore study – one who cannot speak half-a-dozen words of English. My informant is an aged widow lady. I asked her today if she had ever seen the corpse candle, and she positively assured me that she saw it on the night her husband died, and, further, that at the railway station at this place there is to be seen sometimes, late at night, after every one has left, a candle burning in the office, which is a portent of some evil. With all the persuasive powers at my command, I entirely failed in disabusing her mind of this superstitious belief. It is curious to note that the old corpse candle should find an abiding place in the reailyway station.

Smoking in Church .—The following is a cutting from a recent number of the Times :—

"Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to us from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing :— 'Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an oldpractice—viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The Communion-table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hate upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence, have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that 
it should be forgotten.'"

I remember reading somewhere that it was a custom among ladies in South America to have chocolate brought to them as soon as the sermon commenced— a practice denounced by the bishop, who preached against it. He, however, had his cup of chocolate in the sacristy after the service. His persistence in denouncing it was followed by his being found dead in the sacristy after having drunk his cup of chocolate.

Bread and Salt.

Some years since I call for the first time upon Canon Percy, of Carlisle, at his residence there. When refreshment had been offered and declined, he said, "You must have some bread and salt," with some remarks to imply that it was the way to establish a friendship. These were then brought in and eaten, without anything to lead one to suppose that this was an unusual custom at the house. Was this a practic peculiar to himself or to his family? or is such custom prevalent in the North, or in any other part of England? I have not met with it else-where.

Old Yorkshire Customs,—

A few days ago I received a letter from a friend, who holds the office of coroner in the North Riding, which is worth quoting. He says: "I held an inquest the other day at —— on a man who hanged himself; on the breast of the corpse was a plate of salt— a thing rarely seen now. The object is to scare away evil spirits." Brand mentions the custom as being common in his day in Northumberland, and gives a quotation from Moresin’s *Depravatae Religionis Origo*, 1594, "Salem abhorrere constat Diabolum," &c., which bears out my correspondent's statement as to the motive with which the act was done in this case. Such a survival, in the nineteenth century, of an old custom is curious and deserves placing on record in "N. & Q."

Old Yorkshire Customs (6th S. vi. 146).

The practice of placing a plate of salt on the breast of a corpse is a general one among the labouring classes of Dudley and that district, though there it is done not with the object indicated by Mr. Chapman, but with the idea that it acts as a disinfectant and purifies the apartment. B. R.

The custom to which my friend Mr. Chapman refers is perhaps more common than he supposes. It was followed in my own house some years ago (without my previous knowledge or sanction), but I found that in addition to the plate of salt on the breast there was a larger vessel of salt under the bed on which the corpse was laid. I have always heard that the reason for placing the plate of salt on the breast was that given by Mr. Chapman's correspondent, who is, if I may guess at his identity, well acquainted with North Yorkshire traditions. C. G. C.
Richmond, Yorkshire.

I remember seeing a corpse some twenty years since at Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, on the breast of which was placed a pewter plate containing salt. On inquiring for what purpose it was placed there the female in attendance said it was to prevent the corpse swelling. G. J. Dew.
Lower Heyford, Oxon.

Welsh Folk-lore: The Sin-Eater.

The following curious scrap of folk-lore occurs in the Rev. Paxton Hood's book on Christmas Evans, the Preacher of Wild Wales (London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1881) :—

"The superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Caermarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular institution of superstition was, that when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person; he then uttered an incantation over the bread, after which he proceeded to eat it— thereby eating the sins of the dead person; this done, he received a fee of two-and-sixpence—which, we suppose, was much more than many a preacher received for a long and painful service. Having received this, he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aiding his exit with blows and kicks, and other indications of their faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since, and through the ages beyond that time, we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere prevalent."

Welsh Folk-Lore : the Sin-Eater (6th S., vii. 25).— I have just stumbled on the following passage in Leland’s *Collectanea*, vol.i. p. lxxvi (ed. 1774), *à propos* of this matter :—

"Within the memories of our fathers in Shropshire in thore villages adjoyning Wales, when a Person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire (for so they call'd him) who presently repair'd to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the Door of the House, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket on which he sat facing the Door. Then they gave him a Groat which he put in his Pocket, a Crust of Bread which he eat, and a full Bowle of Ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the Cricket and pronounced with a composed gesture, 'The ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul.' This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq.; who made a collection of curious Observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the Hands of Mr. Churchill the Bookseller."

I have since looked through Aubrey's Miscellanies, but find no mention of the subject.

Welsh Foik-Lore: the Sin-Eater (6th S., vii. 25, 334).—See Hone’s *Year Book*, col. 858, where the passage from Leland’s *Collectanea* quoted by W. B. N. is given as forming part of a letter from John Bagford, dated 1715; and where the reader is also referred to the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum for statements concerning sin-eating in Aubrey's own handwriting. The subject was briefly discussed in "N. & Q.," 1st S. iv. 211, a correspondent being referred by the editor to Ellis's edition of Brand's *Popular Antiquities*, vol. ii. p. 155, for information under this head. The custom has, I suspect, been passed over intentionally by the Rev. Peter Roberts in his Cambrian Popular Antiquities, 8vo, 1815; but an aquatint illustration at p. 177 of that work presents us with the ceremony of dispensing food and drink over the coffin to a man who, receives ate kneeling upon one knee. Pennant says that

"it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier for the next-of-kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After
that they presented in the same manner a coup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it imme-
diately."

This seems to indicate a form of "sin-eating."

ALFRED WALLIS.

John Aubrey has three passages concerning sin-eaters in his *Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme*, which was edited and most excellently annotated by Mr. James Britten for the Folk-lore Society in 1881. The passages occur at pp. 19, 24, 35.

SIN-EATERS.

Recently this old custom has been referred to in a local paper ; but the rather contradictory illustrations given call for an explanation, which doubtless some reader will be able to give. It is said that in Upper Bavaria, when a dead person is laid out, a cake of ordinary flour is put on his breast, which is to absorb the virtues of the deceased, the cake afterwards being eaten by the nearest relatives. In Wales, we are told, there was, within the recollection of persons living, the sin-eater. The relatives, in this case, put bread, cheese, and beer on the breast of the dead, and the sin-eater disposed of the lot, and pronounced the everlasting rest of the dead. Here the sin-eater was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the departed. This practice is said to have existed in this neighbourhood in 1851. It will be interesting to learn if these customs still exist ; if so, where. The old custom referred to in Leland's 'Collections' was sin-eating pure and simple.

SIN-EATER.
(8th S. viii. 288, 332.)

There appeared in the *Times* of 18 Sept., 1895, a very interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of Oswestry, on the above subject. Armed with that letter, I spent half a day at the British Museum, and looked through everything that Mr. Thomas refers to as bearing on the matter. I was already familiar with Joseph Downes's tale in the 'Mountain Decameron,' but as I am no folk-lorist, that was about the extent of my own knowledge. It seems that the "authorities" for the alleged custom are (1) Aubrey ; (2) Mr. Matthew Moggridge, of Swansea ; and (3) Pennant.

The important statement as affecting South Wales is Mr. Moggridge's, made at the sixth meeting of the Cambrian Archeological Society at Ludlow on 28 August, 1852.

After describing the custom Mr. Moggridge said that—

"in Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, there was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the practice was said to have pre-vailed to a recent period...... He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred a few yeara ago, but he believed it was extinct now."

Mr. E. A. Freeman inquired whether "sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed?" Mr. Moggridge "answered in the affirmative."

That statement seems to have passed unchallenged, although there were Welshmen actually present—the late Mr. Wynne, of Peniarth, for instance, and the present Bishop of St. David's.

It is greatly to Freeman's credit that his scent for "facts" was keener than the Welshmen's, even on their own ground. "Sin-eater" has never been adopted into the Welsh language, nor is there an equivalent term known in that language. And yet Mr. Moggridge must have had some ground for his assertion. On the supposition that he was acquainted with the Rev. John Williams, who was vicar of Llandebie and Bettws from 1804 to 1850, I think I can give a possible explanation. When, after Williams's death in 1850, there was a sale of his effects at the vicarage, my father bought a large quantity of Welsh periodicals and books. Among these was *Drych yr Amseroedd* (*Mirror of the Times*), by the Rev. Robert Jones, of Rhoslan, Carnarvonshire. That little work was a great favourite of mine when I was a boy. Let me translate a short passage :—

"*Inquirer*: I remember my grandfather mentioning something called Diodlas or Diodles. Can you tell me what that was?

"*Observer*: When some one happened to die in a household, some poor person chosen by the family would be the recipient of that precious (lit. happy) dole the Diodles. The manner of bestowing it was as follows: the family would send a cup to the coffin-maker, to be painted of the same colour as the coffin (two colours were used in those times—black for married folk, white for the single); and when the day of the funeral arrived, after the body had been placed on the bier, the head of the family gave the alms to the poor person selected, that is to say, a big loaf of good bread, and a large chunk of cheese with a piece of silver stuck in it, and the painted cup full of ale (if ale there happened to be), otherwisr of milk, presenting them across the corpse to the poor person. The latter would utter devout and fervent blessings and prayers for (lit. along with) the soul of the dead. It was customary for the entire household, on the first Sunday after the funeral, to go and kneel on the grave, each saying the Lord's Prayer (Pader). And they would never mention any deceased member or relation of the family without saying very devoutly 'Heaven be his portion' (*Nefoedd iddo!*),"— p43.

This custom will be familiar to the reader already, no doubt, from Pennant's 'Tour' (ii. p. 338, London, 1784) ; but the Welsh name, and several graphic touches besides, are not to be found in Pennant's description, which, by the way, is evidently derived from the same source as the account in the British Magazine for 1835 (vol. vii. p. 399), said there to be taken "from a MS. book of a bishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago."

I venture to suggest that it is this by no means repulsive old North Walian custom that has given rise to the myth of the sin-eater. The only Welsh terms for the alleged custom that Mr. Moggridge could possibly have heard are *diodles* and *cwpan y meirw*—both of them unknown in South Wales.

Owen Pughe's 'Welsh Dictionary' (Gee, 1832) has, under *Diawdlesir* :—

"A drinking cup; also a cup-full of drink, so called superstitiously, given for the dead, which in some places is called *diawdlyst*, and *cwpan y meire* (i.e., the cup of the dead).

"*Diawdlyst*=the give-ale."

Canon Silvan Evans's great 'Welsh Dictionary,' now in course of publication, has not yet, I believe, reached D. It does not mention *cwpan y meirw*.

I was very well acquainted, when a boy, with a small farmer from what I must call the "incriminated district," who used to be in great request as a *post mortem* barber. He would most certainly have informed me of such a practice had it ever existed within his personal or traditional knowledge.

I may add that the opening of the "lawless" valley mentioned lies between the two parishes of Liandebie and Bettws, and that Swansea is only some ten or twelve miles off. It is not only possible, but highly probable that the aged vicar of those two parishes had often dwelt on the "Popish" superstition described so graphically in Jones of Rhoslan's little book.

At any rate, that is the only explanation I can suggest of the Cambrian Archaeologists' amusing "comedy of errors." Mr, Sidney Hartland must search somewhere else than in Lilandebie and Cwmamman for evidence in support of his "cannibal" theory. J. P. Owen.
48, Comeragh Road, West Kensington.

P.S.—Perhaps I may be allowed to add that the above was sent for publication to 'N. & Q.' before the appearance of Mr. Sidney Hartland’s first letter in the Academy (Nov., 1895), and that that gentleman had it before him, in the form of a letter from me to Prof. Rhys, in October, 1895.

+++

The two customs mentioned under the above heading are, in reality, quite reconcilable. According to a widely disseminated folk-belief, when a man dies his essential principles, moral or otherwise, may be taken over by some one else, the matter being managed in various ways in different parts of the world. Thus, among certain savage peoples a successful warrior banquets on the body of the enemy he has killed, in order to absorb his bravery and his other enviable characteristics. It is said that in ancient Mexico the captor was under obligation to offer up his captive at one of the solemn sacrificial feasts— an important reason for the custom being, probably, that the prisoner's virtues as a man should be transmitted to the conqueror, though, from another point of view, no doubt the unfortunate sufferer was an earthly representative of the god to whom he was sacrificed.

In most cases where transference of moral or vital powers is supposed to take place, the recipient is thought to benefit ; but this is not a necessary part of the belief. He may occupy the place of a scapegoat, as does the Welsh sin-eater, and take upon himself all responsibility for the misdeeds of the deceased, although he more usually appropriates the good qualities of the dead. The idea of freeing the defunct from his imperfections can scarcely be so ancient as the more selfish notion of seizing his virtues. It would seem to be an outgrowth from the more egotistical belief, aided to some degree in development by the influence of religious or quasi-religious environment. M. P.

+++

The ceremony of sin-eating as it was formerly practised in Scotland is described at p. 60 of Mr. Phiselton Dyer’s 'Domestic Folk-lore.' If my memory serves me, there is a good deal of information on this subject in 'The Golden Bough,' by Mr. Frazer. C. C. B.

+++

Mr. Elton, in 'Origins of English History,' 1882, pp. 181, 182, has some interesting observations on sin-eating. He says, "The superstition certainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may be doubful whether it extended to the neighbouring parts of Wales." He quotes Aubrey's 'Remains of Gentilisme' (as every one writing on the subject does), and refers also to Sikes's 'British Goblins,' 325, and Hone's 'Year Book,' 858. A quotation from Mr. Wirt Sikes shows that the custom prevails in Turkestan. I doubt if the custom survives anywhere in Great Britain or Ireland. James Hooper. Norwich.

+++

Sin-eating pure and simple has, I think, been obsolete in these islands now for some considerable period. An excellent article dealing with the whole matter appears in Folk-Lore, 1892, pp. 144-157, by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. He states, at p. 156, that the custom (of sin-eating in one form or another) was existent, or quite recently existed, among the Greeks and Scots, and possibly among the Dyaks and Gipsies. He quotes the incident which occurred in 1851 or 1852, when the custom was still prevalent in Wales, and gives a reference to the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, N.S., iii. (1852), 330. A curious variant of the custom is mentioned as surviving in Shropshire in 1892 (*Folk-Lore*, iv. pp. 392, 393). W. B. Gerish. Wormley, Herts.

SIN - EATER
(8th S. viii, 288, 332 ; ix. 109.)

As the question of the sin-eater has come up in 'N. & Q.,' and Mr. Owen has alluded in your issue of 8 Feb. to my letter to the *Times* in September last, I should be glad of an opportunity of making a few remarks on the subject. I should have preferred to do so in the *Academy*, but the editor, after inserting Mr. Hartland's letters, in which I was alluded to by name half a dozen times and challenged to explain various facts, published Mr. Owen's reply without a word of explanation to myself.

The original purpose of my letter to the Times was to dispute the evidence for the Llandebie case, and it was only incidentally that the general question of sin-eating was involved.

The main objection to the Llandebie story is the evidence of the schoolmaster Rowlands, who states that cakes were not given at funerals there. If this is so it is difficult to see how the sin-eater could have existed; for it is argued that this custom of giving cakes was a survival of sin-eating, and we are asked to believe that the custom of giving cakes disappeared before the central figure, the sin-eater.

The weakness of Mr. Moggridge's *ipse dixit* is so apparent that I need not enlarge on it ; for, in the absence of any statement of how he came by his information, a story on his authority is worth no more than a statement in an anonymous letter, copied and published without investigation.

I could not, even without the explicit denials which we have before us, attach any importance to such a story ; but when capable men, resident in the neighbourhood, not only fail to find the sin-eater, but vouch for facts actually inconsistent with the existence of the sin-eater at the spot within recent times, it seems absurd to consider the Llandebie case as coming under the head of facts for folk-lorists.

It is singular that no one has ever been produced who has seen a sin-eater, or even spoken with any one who has seen one. If the sin-eater was in existence in 1852 or shortly before, it should be possible now (much more should it have been so in 1877) to produce one who could give testimony of this nature. N. W. Thomas. New College, Eastbourne.

+++

Mr. Owen begins his remarks by saying that "there appeared in the *Times* of 18 Sept., 1895, a very interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of Oswestry, on the above subject." He forgets to say that Mr. Thomas's letter was an attack on Mr. Hartland, to which the latter, in the *Times* and the *Academy*, effectually replied.

Mr. Hartland quoted a passage from my 'Household Tales and Traditional Remains,' p. 124 ; and as this has a material bearing on the subject, I will repeat it here :—

"When you drink wine at a funeral every drop that you drink is a sin which the deceased has committed. You thereby take away the dead man’s sins and bear them yourself."

I can produce the informant from whom this curious piece of folk-lore was obtained. It was offered to me without any questioning when I was collecting folk-lore some years ago, and it is undoubtedly genuine. It completes what Aubrey said about sin-eating; so that English folk-lore is acquainted not only with sin-eating but also with sin-drinking. It matters not whether such terms as "sin-eating" or "sin-drinking" can be proved to have existed in recent times. It is enough to show that the customs themselves existed ; and of this we have ample evidence.

Taking the two customs together, one cannot help seeing a resemblance between them and the *missa pro defunctis*, or mass for the dead. For what is a "mass" for the dead but a "mess" or banquet for the dead? Prof. Skeat tells us that the Low Lat. *missa* "is usually accounted for by supposing that the allusion is to the words *ite, missa est*." But this seems far-fetched and very improbable ; indeed, Prof. Skeat admits that the change of vowel from the Lat. *i* to O.E. oe, as in *moesse*, M.E. *messe*, is remarkable. It is easy to trace the "mess," or feast for the dead, in ancient custom. We may see it in the mass of All Hallows, or All Hallows Day (1 Nov.), of which, even to this day, a reminiscence is found in Yorkshire in the "tharf cakes" eaten during the first week of November. We may see it in the funeral cakes so commonly eaten during the present century. We may see it in the enormous feasts and in the mighty brewings of ale held and made after the death of the wealthy in the Middle-English period. And, going still further back, we may see it in the broken bones, with marrow extracted, scattered throughout so many prehistoric burial mounds in England.`[Greenwell's 'British Barrows', p10.]` From evidence thus presented it appeared to Dr. Thurnam that anthropophagism once prevailed in the British Isles, and he adduced some passages from ancient writers in support of his opinion `[Greenwell, ut supro, p544.]`. These were: Diodorus Siculus, v. 32; Strabo, iv. 5, 4; Plinius, vii. 2; Hieronymus adv. Jovianum, ii.

If the explanation of "mass" here offered be correct, it follows that every "feast" in the calendar is a commemorative banquet. The words of the Saviour, "This do in remembrance of me," may be compared, and also the *minni*, or memorial cup, at old northern sacrifices. S. O. Addy. 3, Westbourne Road, Sheffield.

SIN-EATER (8th S. viii, 288, 332 ; ix. 109, 169). — Mr. Addy's reference to my note in 'N. & Q.' is not quite accurate. I did not "forget to say" that Mr. Thomas's letters to the *Times* were an "attack" on Mr. Hartland, for the simple reason that the latter gentleman had assured me his sole object was to get at the truth, and that he would welcome light from whatever quarter it came. The only thing in the shape of an "attack" that I have seen was Mr. Hartland's criticism on the supposed shortcomings of the venerable Welsh scholar Canon Silvan Evans. So far as I was personally concerned, I thoroughly enjoyed the way in which my own humble contributions to the controversy were handled, though that handling did not tend to enhance my respect for "authority" in matters of folk-lore, nor to deepen my confidence in the dovetailing method of working up accounts of custom and myth. Indeed, Mr. Hartland's efforts

varias inducere plumas 
Undique collatis membris ut turpiter atrum 
Pingeret dvépopayow (Fe-fi-fo-fum Auberiensem),

furnish a lesson that will not, I hope, be thrown away on the guileless reader of the pronouncements of folk-lore "authorities."

The only modern instance of so-called "sin-eating" adduced by Mr. Hartland in his letters that I did not attempt to deal with was the account taken from Mr. Addy’s book. Aubrey and Pennant, Moggeridge and the Pembrokeshire minister were all found to be other than Mr. Hartland’s fancy painted them. I was unable to find a copy of Mr. Addy's work in the British Museum, but that gentleman's own communication to 'N. & Q.' induces me to ask him (1) if the term "sin-drinking" was employed by his informant ; (2) if his informant was a Churchman or a Dissenter; and (3) if he can see his way to publish the name of the locality where the "ritual" described to and by him is practised.

It was only, I believe, through my public avowal of scepticism as to the "significance," from a sin-eating point of view, of the Pembrokeshire minister's remarks at the Market Drayton funeral that Mr. Hartland was induced to sift that tale. The result of his investigation was, if I may borrow Mr. Addy's expression, "effectual" enough. The Market Drayton evidence— "evidence," to quote Mr. Hartland's words in the *Academy* for 9 Nov., "such as could not be doubted" — had become two months later (*Academy*, 11.Jan.) an "incident about which there had been some misapprehension"; while the minister's words "would appear only to have had reference to the general custom of eating and drinking at funerals." I did not attempt to argue with Mr. Hartland. Indeed, there was no need, for the above is only a sample of the "effectual" way in which his own
arguments destroyed either themselves or one another. J. P. Owen, 48, Comeragh Road, W.

Sin-Eater (8th S. viii, 288, 332; ix. 109, 169, 236).— Mr. Owen has put three questions to me, which I answer specifically. (1) The term "sin-drinking" was not employed by my informant, nor does it occur in the text of my book. I used it in the index as the most convenient word for reference. (2) I do not know whether my informant was a Churchwoman or a Dissenter. (3) The name of my informant was Miss Alice Halifax, the daughter of a farmer, formerly living near Dronfield, in Derbyshire, afterwards at Ompton, in Nottinghamshire, and now, I believe, near Newark. Miss Halifax collected folk-lore for me, and I wrote it down from her dictation. I am not aware that any ritual is now practised. S. O. Addy.

Souling.

On the 2nd of November, All Souls' Day, it is in Shropshire the custom for the village children to go round to all their neighbours *souling*, as they call it, collecting small contributions, and singing the following verses, which I took down from two of the children themselves : —

Soul! soul! for a soul-cake ;  
Pray, good mistress, for a soul-cake.  
One for Peter, two for Paul,  
Three for Them who made us all.

Soul! soul! for an apple or two;  
If you've got no apples, pears will do.  
Up with your kettle, and down with your pan ;  
Give me a good big one, and I'll be gone.

Soul! soul! for a soul-cake ;  
Pray, good mistress, a soul-cake, &c.

An apple or pear, a plum or a cherry,  
Is a very good thing to make us merry.  
Soul! soul! &c.

The soul-cake referred to in the verses is a sort of bun, which until lately it was an almost general custom for persons to make, and to give to one another on the 2nd of November. Perhaps some of your readers can state whether this custom prevails in other counties in England. It seems to be a remnant of the practice of collecting alms, to be applied to the benefit of the souls of the departed, for which especial masses and services
were formerly sung on All Souls' Day.

Custom on All Souls' Day. —In two villages lying side by side in the line which marks off Staffordshire from Cheshire, and doubtless elsewhere, bands of children go from house to house, on the evening of All Souls' Day, begging for biscuits, nuts, apples, and the like—all of which they call " soul-cakes" or "sow-cakes" (pronounced "sowl-cake" or "sow"-cake”), in doggrel ballads such as these : —

(1.)  
Step into your cellar—see what you can find :  
If your barrels be not empty,  I hope you will prove kind.
Ihope you will prove kind with your 'aples' and strong beer,  
And we'll come no more ' a-souling' until this time next year."

(2.)  
"One for Peter, one for Paul,  
One for Him as made us all!  
Up with your kettles, and down with your pans,  
Give us a 'sou'-cake’ and we will begone.  

(1) goes to a very pretty tune; (2) is in recitative.

GRIDDLE.

*Griddle* is not gridiron, but is a circular plate of iron (or a broad and shallow pan) made on purpose for baking cakes. It is derived from |It is derived from Welsh *greidel*l*, from *greidiaw*, to heat or scorch. Gridiron is derived from Swedish-Gothic *grädda*, to bake and iron. The griddle-cake mentioned by your correspondent as being made on All-hallows Eve is, I suppose, the same as the soul-cake. ...

At Ripon, in Yorkshire, the women make a cake on the Eve for every one in the family, and  it is called "cake-night." A soul-mass cake was often kept for good luck. Mr. Young, in his *History of Whitby*, says: "A lady in Whitby has a soul-mass loaf one hundred years old." Hunter, in his *Hallamshire Glossary*, says that the custom of making a peculiar kind of cake on this day is recognised in a deposition of the year 1574, given in Watson’s *History of the House of Warren* (i, 217), wherein the party deposes that his mother knew a certain castle of the Earl of Warren’s, having when a child, according to the custom of that country, gathered soul-cakes there on All Souls' Day.

Hallow E’en at Oswestry.— 

I don't think Brand, Hone, or Chambers says anything of a custom that still prevails on the borders of Wales on the eve of All Saints. Numerous parties of children go round the houses, singing at the doors songs, of which the following are popular samples :—

"Wissel wassel, bread and possel,  
An apple or a pair, a plum or a cherry,  
Or any good thing to make us merry.  
One for Peter, and two for Paul,  
And three for the good man that made us all."

What the first line means perhaps some en- lightened reader will say. In some cases the verse is followed with—

"Go down in your cellar and fetch us some beer,  
And we won’t come again until next year."

And generally we hear a further application :—

"The streets are very dirty,  
My shoes are very thin ;  
I’ve got a little pocket To put a penny in."

In all cases the finale is—

"God bless the master of this house,  
God bless the mistress too,  
And all the little ladies,  
Around the table too."

The singing ended, there comes a thundering rap at the door, and you are greeted with "Pleas to giv' us a penny." To my knowledge this has been a custom in Oswestry for forty years, and I hear little voices at my door as I write.

Hallow E'en at Oswestry (4th S. x. 409.)—

I was unable to supply the full text of the doggrel sung on the borders of Wales on All Saints' Eve when I wrote, but it has since been supplied to the "Bye-gones" column of the Oswestry Advertiser, as follows :—

"Wissel wassel, bread and possel,  
Cwrw da, plas yma:  
Apple or a pear, plum or a cherry,  
Any good thing that would make us merry.

Go down to your cellar, and draw some beer,  
And we won’t come here till next year.

Sol cakes, sol cakes,  
I pray you good missis, a sol cake ;  
One for Peter, and two for Paul,  
And three for the man that made us all.

God bless the master of this house,  
Likewise the mistress too,  
And all the little children,  
Around the table too.  
Their pockets lined with silver,  
Their barrels filled with beer,  
Their pantry full of pork pies,  
I wish I had some here.

The roads are very dirty,  
My shoes are very thin,  
I’ve got a little pocket,  
To put a penny in.  
Up with the kettle, and down with the pan,  
Give us an answer, and we'll be gone."

It would appear from this as if we had yet Christmas Carols mixed up with our Hallow E'en ditties. Ritson gives

"God bless the master of this house,  
The mistress also,  
And all the little children
That round the table go,"

as a Christmas carol of the time of James I., and some of the other lines remind one of the carols that made their appearance after the Restoration.

SOUL CAKES

The following, which seems worth a note in "N. & Q." comes to me in a letter from a lady dated "All Saint's Day, 1878." Church Pulverbatch is in Salop, and the letter is written at Chester:—

"I knew an old Mrs. Ward of Church Pulverbatch, who was born in 1752 and died in 1853. She never had an illness in her life. On the dy she *attained her hundredth year* she was dressed in her bridal dress of yellow satin, and kept her *fête* by receivng the Holy Communionwith her friends and neighbours. I am reminded of her just now by the children who are singing their 'Souling Song' under my window; for Mrs. Ward was the last of her generation — or of any generation — in her neighbourhood, to make 'soul cakes.'"

"Soul-caking." A few years ago when living in Cheshre, the youths used to dress up (some in women's clothes) and go to houses on All Saint's Day. It was called "soul-caking". Was this custom the survival of a religious play ; or the asking of alms for masses for the dead, to be said on All Souls’ Day’? Very little notice was taken of Noy. 5 in that part.

*Soul-caking* (8th S. iv. 49).—Your correspondent will find much information about soul- cakes in Brand's 'Popular Antiquities,' art, "All- hallow Even" (ed. Bohn, i. 390, sqq.). This includes a note by Tollett :

" That on All Saints’ Day, the poor people in Staffordshire...... go from parish to parish *a souling*, as they call it, i.e., begging and puling (or singing small, as Bailey's 'Dictionary' explains puling) for *soul cakes*, or any good thing to make them merry. This custom is mentioned by Peck, and seems a remnant of Popish superstition to pray for departed souls, particularly those of friends."

It is added by the editor :—

"The custom of going a Souling still continues in some parts of the county, peasant girls going to farmhouses, singing:—

Soul, soul, for a soul cake,  
Pray you, good mistress, a soul cake."  
F. ADAMS.

For soul-cakes in Chester in the year 1878 see 'N. & Q.,' 5th S. x. 426. Consult also 'A Garland for the Year,' by John Timbs, p. 115; Brand's 'Popular Antiquities,' vol. i. p. 217 (notes to " All-hallow Eve"); and 'Clavis Calendaria,' vol. ii. p. 229.

In Austria "Halloween cakes" are still eaten on November 1; but to my knowledge there is no special custom in connexion with them. A specimen may no doubt be procured in London at either the Vienna Café in New Oxford Street, or at an Austrian confectioner’s shop towards the Shepherd's Bush end of High Street, Notting Hill. The name of the cake is "Heiligen Stritz'l."
