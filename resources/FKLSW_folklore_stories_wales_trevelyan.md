An ancient custom, which prevailed in remote districts so late as the last half of the eighteenth century, was formerly remembered by aged people. When a person died, the relatives sent for a local bard or another individual to perform the following ceremony: Upon this man's arrival, he placed a pinch of salt on the breast of the deceased, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then recited the Lord's Prayer or the Apostles' Creed over the bread, and then ate the latter. When this was done, he was paid a fee of not less than two shillings and sixpence. Then he went away. In superstitious times this man was regarded with loathing, and as one absolutely lost,

because he had, as it were, eaten the sins of the deceased. In remote centuries he was called the "sin-eater." An aged man living in the year 1826 had the reputation of having been in his earlier days a sin-eater. [Family Collection.]
This custom was in no way connected, as some people assert, with Druidism. It seems to have been a survival of mediaeval times.
In the early part of the nineteenth century people arranged funerals to take place after nightfall, either by moonlight or torchlight, and very often in the twilight. This custom has long become obsolete, but even now the sunset hour is often chosen for funerals.
Previous to the year 1852 it was considered unfeeling to leave a dead body in a room by itself during the interval between death and burial. By day and night the corpse was watched, and candles were kept burning in the death-chamber.
Every village and rural town in Wales formerly had its traditional road by which the dead were carried* Many of these still remain, and are locally called "the burying lane." It was thought that if the funeral procession went along any other road, the soul of the deceased would have no peace. The ancient town of Llantwit Major, Glamorgan, still remains its "burying lane," but it is no longer used by funeral processions. In some places this was called the "death-road," and in earlier ages it was connected with Hades, or the intermediate state between earth and the abode of the blessed. The "death-road" was a remnant of pre-Reformation times, and has long since become obsolete; but the "burying lane" is still to be found in many parts of Wales.
There was an old belief that this road or "burying lane" must always be kept level, smooth, and in good repair, for Death was supposed to walk up and down it three days before the soul parted from the body, and, if it was in good order, the better it would be for the deceased.
