Welsh Wit and Wisdom
...

In his interesting work on Church folk- lore the Rev. J. Edward Vaux says that one of the most striking (ustoms m connection with funerals is a custom which continued till the seventeenth century. "There was in one of the villages adjoining the Welsh border an old man called the 'Sin Eater,' and his office was, for a trifling consideration, to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed. When a person died notice was given to him, and he at once went to the house of the deceased. A cucket —that is, a stool- was brought, and he sat down in front of the door. A groat, a crust of bread, and a full bowl of ale were given to him, after which he rose and pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul. It was believed that this ceremony would free the departed soul from "walking thenceforth."

SMOKING IN CHURCH. Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to the "Times" from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing:— "Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him re-calls an old practice— viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The Communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence. I have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten."

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

A column ot the "Times" of Monday was occupied with a letter from Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. Highgarth, Gloucester, on the subject of "The Sin-eater in Wales." The letter is written in answer to another correspondent, Mr. N. W. Thomas, who denied the existence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the Academy twenty years ago and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World" of February, 1882 Mr. Hartland claims that neither of these denials can outweigh the positive statements he cites in the earlier portion of his letter.

Apropos to the discussion on the sin-eater, the following from "Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable" may not be without inte- rest:—"Sin-eaters— Persons hired at funerals in ancient times to take upon themselves the sins of the deceased that the soul might be delivered from purgatory. Notice was given tc. an old sire before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket [low stool], on which he sat down facing the door; then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate, and a bowl of ale, which ho drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

The Sin-Eater in Wales controversy is summarised by a Birmingham paper, which remarks :— As a preliminary we may explain that sin-eaters, according to certain antiquarians, were a class of men who attended funerals in ancient times, and partook of bread and ale placed on the bier, and so symbolically took on themselves the sins of the deceased. It was believed that whenever this ceremony was performed that the spirit of the dead sinner would be saved from walking the earth in troubled state.

The denial of sin-eating in Wales by Mr. Thomas, of Oswestry, has called forth a mass of evidence in proof of the contrary from Mr. Sidney Hartland, one of the most learned of Midland antiquarians, which is printed in the current number of the "Academy." Mr. Hartland relies mainly on old-time writers for his information. Aubrey mentions the custom, as performed by a "long, leane, ugly, lamentable, poor raskal" in Herefordshire. When the body was placed on the bier, "a Loafe of Bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar-bowle of maple full of beer, which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after death."

The sin-eater controversy did not end when it disappeared from these columns. The "Times," the "Academy," and one of the Birmingham papers opened their columns to the discussion, and now a volume has appeared, entitled, "The Sin-Eater, and Other Stories," by Miss Fiona Macleod, of which a reviewer says "she (the authoress) has caught in no small degree the spirit of the Celt, with its gloom and superstition, its fixity of purpose, its harshness and nobility."
