Thoms, who suggests the following points as a ?? the headquarters of the Society must be in London, and that there should be a yearly subscriptii n of it. is. Regarding the first suggestion, Mr. Thoins w rites: 1s I insist on this because the Folk Lore Society miust not only have a local habitation and a name, but that habitation must ibe central and permanent," and as to the second he very naturally says that from the very motives of the Society the incidental expenses will be large, apart from the paper and printing ; and paper and print are luxuries which must be paid for. Mr. ?? proposes that one of the duties of the Society will be to gather in the various local journals which indulge in folk-lore columns, and to mount and preserve these columns for future use, and, next to gathering together the relics of our folk-lore, the collecting of analogous folk-lore of other countries. The more important items of their researches would be published in an annual volume. Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, whose name is familiar to readers of .Aotes and Que7ries, has consented to act as Honorary Searetary, and any lady or gentleman (for, remarks Mr. Thorns, the Folk- Lore Society is one which may be greatly promoted by ladies) who may be disposed, is requested to communicate his orher inten- tions to that gentleman, at 26, Merthyr Terrace, Castelnau, Barnes
