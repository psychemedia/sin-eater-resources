We have heard it asserted that the premonitory token of a death, known as "corpse-candles," is known only to the diocese of St David's
But in the interesting publication 'Bygones' already
alluded to we find a remarkable account of their incidence at Crigion,[Bygones, 1871-3, p. 36. The account has been somewhat shortened and alteredqua language, to suit the limits of our article.] in the county of Montgomery and diocese of Hereford, and
we have little doubt that the superstition has small regard for distinctions of North and South Wales. The statement of an old inhabitant will explain its nature and peculiarities. “During a heavy snow, when he was a boy, his mother, as she went up-stairs to bed, pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farm-house towards the church. A servant coming up-stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the Church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished at the farm-house. Its tenant, they knew, was unwell, but, as the snow was so deep, it was not till the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked up, so that, on the day of the funeral, it was found impossible to take the procession by the usual route, and a portion of the church-wall had to be taken down, to admit the entrance of the bier. That portion of the wall was the exact spot which the deponent saw the light cross on the evening of the death." [According to Borrow, Wild Wales, vol. iii. p. 223, these corpse-candles are dangerous to those who  casually meet them. Men die from contact with them, then the candle is abroad on another errand.] Of all the many death-tokens we are acquainted with —such as the “hooting of owls,” “the solitary crow at the tree," “the howling of dogs," “the crowing hen," the sudden stopping of the family clock-none is so weird and impressive as this of the corpse-candles, none less soluble by natural causes, or even by the freaks of human credulity. Among deathbed customs prevalent in the Principality, it is not easy to explain that which removes from under the dying head a pillow that has
pigeon's feathers in it; nor is it by any means a sufficient reason for the custom, widely prevalent, of placing a deep pewter plate filled with salt upon the chest of the corpse immediately after “laying out," that it is done to prevent the body swelling. Salt is rather, as is explained by the learned and curious Brand, the emblem of eternity and immortality, and as such a sort of “satan-fuge,” for “the devil loveth no salt in his meat," and the righteous are “the salt of the earth.” As Herrick writes-

“The body's salt the soul is, which, when gone,  
The flesh soone sucks in putrefaction.”

It is a darker and narrower superstitution, still surviving in North 
and South Wales, and the Border, which at a funeral hands over to a hireling, who lives by such services, a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death. It is hard to say which is most degraded, the employers or the employed, in such a transaction. The scapegoat in this case is currently called a "Sin-eater." Of such it would be no stretch of imagination to believethat, like Sion-y-Cint, the Welsh Faust, they had sold themselves to the devil. Amidst odd graveyard etiquette, we may notice that in some parishes of Montgomeryshire it is all-important to rest the corpse under the shade of the mountain-ash, whose magical virtue lies in the belief that it was the wood of the Saviour's Cross. More common is the usage of mourners and others who attend a Welsh funeral, carry-ing a sprig of rosemary and dropping it into the grave with the last words of the service. These floral rites are very pretty, and we hope
not soon likely to die out. Who that has any acquaintance with Monmouthshire can easily forget Flowering Sunday? Or who would wish to see discontinued the lingering Shropshire custom of hanging garlands in the churches at the death of a maiden? ...
