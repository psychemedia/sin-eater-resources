V.—Corpse Candles. 


‘© About the latter end of the 16th century, 
and the beginning of the 17th, there lived 
in the valley of Ebwy Fawr, one Walter 
John Harry, belonging to the people called 
Quakers, a harmless honest man, and by 
occupation a farrier, who went to live at 
Ty yn y Fid, in that valley, where one 
Morgan Lewis, a weaver, had lived before 
him, and after his death. had appeared to 
some and troubled the house. One night, 
Walter being in bed with his wife, and 
awake, saw a light come up stairs, and ex- 
pecting to see the » and being some- 
what afraid, though he was naturally a very 
fearless man, strove to awake his wife by 
pinching her, but could not awake her ; 
and seeing the spectre coming with a can- 
dle in his hand, and a white woollen cap 
upon his head, and the dress he always 
wore, resolved to speak to him, and did 
when he came near the bed, and said, 
* Morgan Lewis, why dost thou walk this 
earth ?? To which the apparition gravely 
answered, like one in some distress, ‘ that it 
was because of some bottoms of wool which 
he had hid in the wall of the house, which 
he desired him to take away, and then he 
would trouble them no more.’ And then 
Walter said, ‘ I charge thee, Morgan Lewis, 
in the name of God, that thou trouble my 
house no more ;’ at which he vanished away, 
and appeared no more.”

having been at a debauch one night, and 

ing home late whem the doors were 
locked, and the people in bed, feared to 
disturb them; fearing also their chiding 
and expostulations about his staying so late, 
went to the servant, who slept in an out 
room, as is often the manner in this coun- 

. He could not wake the servant, but 
while he stood over him, he saw a small light 
come out of the servant’s nostrils, which soon 
became a corpse-candle. He followed it out 
until it came to a foot bridge, which lay 
over a rivulet of water. It came into the 
entleman’s head to raise up the end of the 
foot bridge from off the bank whereon it 
lay, to see what it would do. When it 
came, it seemed to offer to go over, but did 
‘not go, as if loath to go because the bridge 
was displaced. When he saw that, he put 
the bridge in its place, and stayed to see 
what tiie candle would do. It came = the 
bridge when it was replaced ; but when it 
came near him, it struck him, as it were 
with an handkerchief; but the effect was 
strong, for he became dead upon the place, 
not knowing of himself a long time before 
he revived: such is the power of the spirits 
of the.other world, and it is ill jesting with 
them. A Sadducee, and a proud ridiculer 


of apparitions, in this gentleman’s place . 


now, would have a pure seasoning for his 
pastime. *Tis true, these gentlemen have 


not seen the corpse-candles of Wales; but 
they should believe the numerous and ever- 
continuing witnesses of it, and not foolishly 


discredit abundant matters of fact, attested 
By honest wise men. We have heard of 
others, who, from an excess of natural cour- 
age, or being in liquor, have endeavoured 
to stop the corpse-candles, and have been 
struck down upon the place ; but now none 
offer it, being deterred by a few former ex- 
amples, related, remembered, and justly be- 
lieved.” 

** Joshua Coslet, a man of sense and 
knowledge, told me of several corpse-can- 
dles he had seen, but of one in particular 
which he saw in a lane, called Heol bwich 
y gwynt (Wind gap lane), in Landeilo 
Fawr parish, where he suddenly met a 
corpse-candle, of a small light when near 
him, but increasing as it went farther from 
him. He could easily perceive that there 
was some dark shadow passing along with 
sya but he was ~~ to look ear- 

ly it. Not long after a burying 
quned thet wer. He told me, that it is the 
common opinion, doubtless trom some ex- 
perience of it, that if a man should wan- 
tonly strike it, he should be struck down 
by it; but if onetouches it unawares, he shall 
pass on unhurt. He also said, that some dark 
shadow of a man carried the cundle, hold- 
ing it between his three fore fingers over 
against his face. This is what some have 
seen, who had the courage to look earnest- 
y. Others have seen the likeness of a can- 

carried in a skull. There is nothing 
unreasonable or unlikely in either of these 
representations.” 


* One William John, of the parish of 
Lanboydi, a smith, on going home gp» 
night, being somewhat drunk and bold (it 
seems too bold), saw one of the 
dles ; he went out of his way to meet with 
it, and when he came near it, he saw it way 
a burying, and the upon the bier, 
the perfect resemblance of a woman in the 
neighbourhood whom he knew, holding the 
candle between her fore fingers, who dread. 
fully grinned at him ; and presently he was 
struck down from his horse, where he 
mained a while, and was ill a long tim 
after before he recovered. This was before 
the real burying of the woman. His fault, 
and therefore his danger, was his comi 
presum ly against the candle.—This is 
another sensible proof of the apparition and 
being of spirits.” 

‘© The fore-knowledge of those corps. 
candle spirits, concerning deaths and buriak, 
is wonderful, particular as the following in. 
stance will shew:—One Rees Thomas, » 
carpenter, passing through a place called 
Rhiw Edwst, near Cappel Ewen, by mi 
heard a stir coming towards him, walki 
and speaking ; and when they were come to 
him, he felt as if some person put their hand 
upon his shoulder, and saying to him, Rhy 
bach pa fodd yr y’ch chwi?—( Dear Rees, how 
are you) ? which surprised him much, fer 
he saw nothing. Buta month after, paw 
ing that way, he met a burying in that 
very place; and a woman who was in th 
company, put her hand upon him and spoke 
exactly the same words to him that them 
visible spirit had spoken to him before; a 
which he could no less than wonder. This 
I had from the mouth of Mr T. I. of Tre 
vach, a godly minister of the x 

** The following account I had from ue 
der the hand of Mr Morris Griffith, a man 
truly religious, and a lively preacher of the 
gospel among the Baptists, which came t 
pass in Pembrokeshire, as follows :—When 
I kept school at Pont-Faen parish, in Pem 
brokeshire, as I was coming from a place 
called Tre-Davith, and was come to the top 
of the hill, I saw a great light down in the 
valley, which I wondered at, for I could not 
imagine what it meant, But it came to my 
mind that it was a light before a burying, 
though I never could believe before thi 
there was such a thing. The light which! 
saw then was a very red light, and it stood 
still for about a quarter of an hour in th 
way which went towards Lanferch-llawddy 
church. I made haste to the other sided 
the hill, that I might see it farther; aml 
from thence I saw it go along to the church 
yard, where it mien still for a little time, 
and entered into the,church: I stood still 
waiting to see it come out, and it wasnt 
long before it came out, and went to ace 
tain part of the church-yard, where it sto 
a little time, and then vanished out of my 


sight.

with the children about noon, I heatls 
great noise over head, as if the top of te

the shape of the person that is to die, carry-

said that they saw the shape of those who 
were to be at the burying. I am willing 
to suspend my belief of this, as seeming to 
be extravagant, though their foreboding 
knowledge of mortality appears to be very 
wonderful and undeniable.”

Legends and Folklore of North Wales


[Seems to draw on Bye-gones  - Oswestry Adbvertiser - a lot...]
...

We have heard it asserted that the premonitory token of a death, known as "corpse-candles," is known only to the diocese of St David's. But in the interesting publication 'Bygones' already alluded to we find a remarkable account of their incidence at Criggion, [Bygones, 1871-3, p. 36. The account has been somewhat shortened and altered *qua* language, to suit the limits of our article.] in the county of Montgomery and diocese of Hereford, and
we have little doubt that the superstition has small regard for distinctions of North and South Wales. The statement of an old inhabitant will explain its nature and peculiarities. "During a heavy snow, when he was a boy, his mother, as she went up-stairs to bed, pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farm-house towards the church. A servant coming up-stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the Church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished at the farm-house. Its tenant, they knew, was unwell, but, as the snow was so deep, it was not till the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked up, so that, on the day of the funeral, it was found impossible to take the procession by the usual route, and a portion of the church-wall had to be taken down, to admit the entrance of the bier. That portion of the wall was the exact spot which the deponent saw the light cross on the evening of the death." [According to Borrow, Wild Wales, vol. iii. p. 223, these corpse-candles are dangerous to those who casually meet them. Men die from contact with them, then the candle is abroad on another errand.] Of all the many death-tokens we are acquainted with —such as the "hooting of owls," "the solitary crow at the tree," "the howling of dogs," "the crowing hen," the sudden stopping of the family clock-none is so weird and impressive as this of the corpse-candles, none less soluble by natural causes, or even by the freaks of human credulity. Among deathbed customs prevalent in the Principality, it is not easy to explain that which removes from under the dying head a pillow that has pigeon's feathers in it; nor is it by any means a sufficient reason for the custom, widely prevalent, of placing a deep pewter plate filled with salt upon the chest of the corpse immediately after “laying out," that it is done to prevent the body swelling. Salt is rather, as is explained by the learned and curious Brand, the emblem of eternity and immortality, and as such a sort of "satan-fuge," for “the devil loveth no salt in his meat," and the righteous are "the salt of the earth." As Herrick writes-

"The body's salt the soul is, which, when gone,  
The flesh soone sucks in putrefaction."

It is a darker and narrower superstition, still surviving in North and South Wales, and the Border, which at a funeral hands over to a hireling, who lives by such services, a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death. It is hard to say which is most degraded, the employers or the employed, in such a transaction. The scapegoat in this case is currently called a "Sin-eater." Of such it would be no stretch of imagination to believe that, like Sion-y-Cint, the Welsh Faust, they had sold themselves to the devil. Amidst odd graveyard etiquette, we may notice that in some parishes of Montgomeryshire it is all-important to rest the corpse under the shade of the mountain-ash, whose magical virtue lies in the belief that it was the wood of the Saviour's Cross. More common is the usage of mourners and others who attend a Welsh funeral, carrying a sprig of rosemary and dropping it into the grave with the last words of the service. These floral rites are very pretty, and we hope not soon likely to die out. Who that has any acquaintance with Monmouthshire can easily forget Flowering Sunday? Or who would wish to see discontinued the lingering Shropshire custom of hanging garlands in the churches at the death of a maiden? ...
