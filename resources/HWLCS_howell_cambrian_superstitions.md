Every natioDi has its peculiar soperstitions, 
and as regards the Corpse Candles or, in Welsh, 
Canwyllaucyrph^ they are universally known to be 
endemic (if I may use the expression) to Wales.-i— 
It appears that these lights are generally observed 
tp v«er their course towards the churchyard, which 
they enter i hover round the spot wher^ the person 
whose death they intimate will be buried, and dis- 
appear ; they vary in brilliancy and size, according 
to the person whose doom it is to leave the world ; 
thus an infant's would not be larger than that of a 
' candle, whilst a child's <' of the larger growth'' is 
of a proportionate size ; the colour is said to be a sul- 
phureous blue,]: and when any one observes their 
approach, if they do not move aside they >Hrili be 
struck down by their force, as Twas informed. by a 
|>erson living, whose father coming in contact with 
one, was thrown off his horse. If th^y are seen to 
stop, the corpse will do the same at the funeral ; if 
they move aside, it will occur so at the buriial ; and 
should two candles meet, the two funerals ^ill do 
the same: it is also said that if a person looks back 
at one after it has passed himV he will perceive the 
corpse and its attendants.

The reason of their appearing^ is generally at- 

tributed to a Bishop of St. David's, a martyr, who 

^ in olden days, whilst hurning, prayed that they 

, might be seen in Wales, (some say in his diocese 

only) before a person's death, that they might testify 

that he had died a martyr ; and in many parts of 

' North Wales, the people are almost distracted when 

, they see them^ as it is not known whose death they 

J predict. Anbrey mentions several instances in his 

. Miscellanies^ and Tregortha also in his Invisible 

World. 

; As may be supposed, there are many fictitious 

tales told respecting these lights', for doubtless were 

» a Wiflo* the wisp se^^rij it would ipstantlybe set down 

. as a Corpse Candle; bjut aa I have oonglomerated 

the most antl^ntic accounts, and from those whom 

V I can credit, the reader need not doubt their vera- 

i^ city, as several have been confessed solemnly to 

ministers, many of wliom in Wales gave implicit 

credence to these forerunners of death. 

It is said, that some years ago whep the d^oaeh 
; which runs from Llandilo to Carmarthen, wjf^ pass- 
, tng by Golden Grove, (the property of,, the qoble 
£arl Cawdor) three corpse candles were observeld 
on the surface of the water^gliding down the stream 
which runs near the road; all the passengers behalf 
them, and it is related that a few days after, some 
men were crossingthe river iiear there in a coracle, 
but one of them expressed his fear at venfiy*ing, as 
the river vtras flooded, and remained behind ; the

about a quarter of an hour, in the rbadtb the church ' 
of Uiife^chHawdAg, after which it went into the

the churchyard. In a few days afterwards ihie son

ni^ht. There is also now living in St. John's- 
town, near Carmarthen, an aged individaal of the 
name of Jones, who has confidently assured a rela- 
tion of mine, that ^he was accustomed to see these 
candles proceeding^ down the road to Llanllwch 
<2burch ; and that she observed that the funerals in* 
variably took the same direction, moving aside 
just as she had seen their precursors^ and that^be- 
fore any one was drowned, she has frequently seen 
a light float on the river.
