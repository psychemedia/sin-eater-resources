In praise of ale
by W. T. Marchant

1888

p.93-4



Probably the most peculiar of the many quaint customs which our ancestors kept up was the funeral one of sin eating. In a letter dated 1715, printed in Leland's Collection, it is stated that, within the memory of the writer's father, in those villages adjoining Wales, when a person died notice was given to an old "sire" or village patriarch, who straightway repaired to the house of mourning and sat down on a "cricket," or stool, facing the door ; then one of the family of the deceased gave the sin-eater a groat, which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread which he ate, and a full bowl of ale which he drank off at a draught. Finally, he rose from the cricket, and with a composed gesture pronounced "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul". In Hereford, according to Aubrey, the sin-eater ate his bread and drank his bowl of beer over the corpse, and his fee was sixpence instead of fourpence. Bishop Kennett, to whom Aubrey's manuscripts passed, added to them a note that a remainder of this custom lingered at the beginning of the eighteenth century in the parish of Amersham, in the county of Bucks. There, at the burial of every corpse, a cake and a flagon of ale were brought to the clergyman in the porch ; but this refection was not served until after the interment.
