Mr Elton B. Ede writes to the "Times" from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing: — "Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice — viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The Communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence."

"THE SIN-EATER IN WALES."

Mr N. M. Thomas, writing on Monday to the "Times" on this subject, and dealing with "the evidence for the recent existence of the sin-eater," said:- As I should explain, did space permit, I do not regard analogical evidence very satisfactory for two reasons: (1) Aubrey may have misinterpreted a ceremony which he saw (he does not tell us that the name sin-eater was used, I think); (2) the sin-eater, if he existed, may not unreasonably be regarded as the result of a misunderstanding of other customs. The evidence for the recent existence in Wales of this personage is the evidence of Mr Moggridge — a story related by him, at Ludlow, and derived no one knows where, at least second hand, perhaps, third, fourth, or fifth hand. Against this we have the evidence of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the Nonconformist minister — no doubt such a conjunction is enough to damn any cause; but we must remember that the schoolmaster was no tyro at folk-lore, he had collected legends and customs for Sir Thomas Phillips. Even a clergyman and a diocesan inspector can elicit ghost stories in a strange parish. Much more can a local schoolmaster find a sin-eater. Secondly, no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welch word for the name is known. Thirdly, no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater, or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived. Even if I accept Mr Hartland's canon of evidence I should not think that probability lay on his side. Holding that folk-lore requires stricter evidence of customs, which an eye-witness might readily misinterpret, I hold to my position that the sin-eater has not existed in Wales in recent times."
