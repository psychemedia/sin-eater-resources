Preface

The *Remaines* while containing much of value, are not of equal merit throughout. Aubrey had the faculty of collection rather than that of selection, and he was clearly inclined to be credulous, and thought to be so by some of his most noteworthy contemporaries. The great naturalist John Ray, for example, expresses himself plainly on this head in a letter printed by Aubrey in the *Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey* (v. 410). He says : —

"I think (if you can give me leave to be free with you) that you are a little too inclinable to credit strange relations. I have found men that are not skilful in the history of nature very credulous, and apt to impose upon themselves and others, and therefore dare not give a firm assent to anything they report upon their own authority, but are ever suspicious that they may either be deceived themselves, or delight to teratologize (pardon the word), and to make show of knowing strange things."

In the same work, however (iv. 407, Appendix), Aubrey gives the following justification of his conduct : —

"It may seem nauseous to some that I have raked up so many old western proverbs, which I confess I disdain not to quote. Pliny himself being not afraid to call them oracles, lib. 18, cap. 4: 'Ac primum omnium oraculis majore ex parte agemus, quae non in alio vitae genere plura certiorave sunt.' For proverbs are drawn from the experience and observation of many ages, and are the ancient natural philosophy of the vulgar, preserved in old English and Norse rhymes handed down to us, and which I set as instantiae crucis, for our curious modem philosophers to examine, and give διολις  to their 'Ολις."

At the present day, whatever we may think of Aubrey's credulity, all folk-lorists are glad that he did not "disdain to quote" the proverbs, sayings, and traditions of the people.

With regard to the notes which I have here and there added, a word or two of explanation seems needed. When I undertook to edit the work at the request of the Council of the Folk-Lore Society, I had hoped that these would be much more numerous, and that I should have obtained much help in my work from those who were far more fitted than myself to undertake the task. I regret to say that, although the work was sent in slip-proof to all the Members of the Council, I have received no assistance whatever from the greater number of them. I do not wish to be imderstood as complaining of this want of assistance — I know too well what it is to be more than fully occupied — but I mention this as tending to explain the fewness of the notes.  ...

Sinne Eaters [see p. 33]

Jam tamen extincto cineri sua dona ferebant;  
Compositiq' nepos busta piebat avi. — [F. v. 425-6]

Signaq' dat digitis medio cum pollice junctis;  
Occurrat tacito ne levis umbra sibi.  
Terq' manus puras fontana perluit unda;  
Vertitur, et nigras accipit ore fabas.  
Aversusq' jaci: sed dum jacit, Haec ego mitto;  
His, inquit, redimo meq' meosq' fabis.  
Hoc novies dicit, nec respicit: umbra putatur  
Colligere, et nullo terga vidente sequi.— .[F. v. 433-440.]

Google Translate:

But when the ashes had already been extinguished, they were carrying their own gifts;
The grandson of Composiq' pity the tombs of his grandfather. [F. t. 425-6]
He gives the signs and the middle fingers with the thumbs joined together;
Let him come across in silence, lest a slight shadow come to him. The spring-water washes the pure hands thrice;
He turns, and gets black beans in his mouth.
To be cast away from him: but while he casts, These things I send;
With these, he says, I buy off my beans.
He says this nine times, and does not look back; the shadow is supposed to
To collect, and to follow with no rear sight.

Sinne-eaters. [See pp. 18, 22]

In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to hire/have
poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scape-goate in ye old Lawe. Leviticus, cap. xvi. verse 21, 22. "And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate and confesse over him all yw iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fitt man into the wildernesse. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let the goat goe into the wildernesse." This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed/continued even on the strictest time of ye Presbyterian goverment: as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish, the kinred/relations of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in this Countie ; as also in Brecon, e, g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custome was heretofore used over all Wales.

See Juvenal Satyr, vi. [519-521,] where he speakes of throwing purple thread into ye river to carry away ones sinne.

In North-Wales, the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of; but there, insted of a Bowle of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke.

Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good Beer. — Cramer.

*Soule-Cakes*

In Salop, &c. die oïum Animarum (All-Soules-day Novemb. 2d) there is sett on the Board a high heap of Soule-cakes, lyeing one upon another like the picture of the Sew-Bread in the old Bibles. They are about the bignesse of 2d cakes, and n'ly all the visitants that day take one ; and there is an old Rhythm or saying,

A Soule-cake, a Soule-cake,  
Have mercy on all Christen soules for a Soule-cake.

This custome is continued to this time. This putts me in mind of the Feralia dict, à ferendis ad tumulum epulis: id quod forant [ferunt ?] tunc epulas ad sepulchrum quibus jus ibi parentare. Feralia deiun manium dies in Febr. Had Ovid continued his Fastorum to Novemb: in probabiliiy we should have found such a kind of custome used at that time sc. Novemb: 2d.

Mdm. Seed-cakes, for the Ploughmen, after Sowing is donne; I thinke, All-Saints' night, or Eve. Also Cakes at Home-harvest.

*Offertories at funeralls.*

These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye ch. of Engl. Comon-Prayer-booke : but I never sawe it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey ; but it is used over all the Counties of North-Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake & Cheese, and a new Bowie of Beere, and another of Milke with yw Anno Dni ingraved on it, & yw parties name deceased, wch one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps ; & this Custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales `[From this to the end of the paragraph is added by Dr. Kennett. — Ed.]`, where a small tablet or board is fixt near the Altar, upon whch the friends of ye defunct lay their offerings in mony according to their own ability and the quality of the person deceased. This custom proves a very happy augmentation to some of the very poor vicars, and is often the best part of their maintenance.

*Sinne-eaters*

It seems a remainder of this custom was lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment were brought to the minister in the Ch. porch. W. K.
