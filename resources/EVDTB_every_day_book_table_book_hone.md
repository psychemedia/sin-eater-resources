October 31 - ALLHALLOW EVEN

Pennant records, that in North Wales " there is a custom upon All Saints Eve of making a great fire called Coel Coeth, when every family about an hour in the night makes a great bonfire in the most conspicuous place near the house ; and when the fire is almost extinguished, every one throws a white stone into the. ashes, having first marked it ; then, having said their prayers, turning round the fire, they go to bed. In the morning, as soon as they are up, they come to search out the stones ; and if any one of them is found wanting, they have a notion that the person who threw it in will die before he sees another All Saints Eve." They also distribute *soul cakes* on All Souls-day, at the receiving of which poor people pray to God to bless the next crop of wheat.
