CUSTOMS AT DEATHS.

The "Vulgar Errors" of Browne, with the interesting notes and additions of Mr. Ellis, recently published, furnish us with a curious detail of the various customs formerly observed at deaths, and several of which are yet retained in different parts of England. The article, as given in the work, is prolix, and contains some extraneous matter, which we think might have been omitted with advantage. In the following extracts we have selected only the parts most entertaining: they are ranged under several heads, as— "The Passing- Bell," "Watching The Dead," "Setting Salt or Candles on the Body," "The carrying of Torches and Lights," "Funeral Sermons," &c.

The PASSING BELL, so called from its denoting the passing or departing of any one from life to death, was originally intended to invite the prayers of the faithful for the person who was dying, but was not yet dead ; and though in some instances superstitiously used, has its meaning clearly pointed out in a clause in the "Advertisements for Due Order," &c. in the seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, which enjoins "that when anye Christian bode is *in passing*, that the *bell be toled*, and that the Curate be speciallie called for to comfort the sicke person ; and *after the time of his passing*, to ring no more but one short peale; and one before the buriall, and another short peale after the buriail." Grose, referring to the old Catholic belief on this subject, treats it rather ludicrously, though its intention, as just duscribed, was evidently serious. "The Passing Bell," says he, "was anciently rung for two purposes; one to bespeak the prayers of all good Christians for a soul just departing ; the other, to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the bed's foot, and about the house ready to seize their prey, or at least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage ; but by the ringing of that bell (for Durandus, a writer of the twelfth century, inform us evil spirits are much afraid of bells) they were kept aloof; and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start, or had what is; by sportsmen, called law."

In the diary of Robert Birrel, preserved in "Fragments of Scottish History," &c. is the following curious entry :- "1566, the 25 of October, word came to the towne of Edinburghe, from the Queine, yat hir Majestie was deadly seike, and desirit ye bells to be runge, and all ye peopile to resort to ye Kirk to pray for her, for she was so seike that none lepsied her life" (expected her to live.) Bourne supposes, that from the saying mentioned by Bede, "Lord have mercy on my soul," which St. Oswald uttered when he fell to the earth, has been derived the distich so often introduced in ballads on the melancholy occasion of a coming execution:–

"When the bell begins to toll,  
LORD have mercy on my soul!"

In a very rare book entitled "Wits, Fits, and Fancies," (1614) the author relates a droll anecdote concerning the ringing out at the burial of "a rich churle and a begger who were buried at one time, in the same churchyard, and the bells rang out amaine for the miser. Now the wiseacre, his son, and executor," says he, "to the ende the worlde might not thinke that all that ringing was for the begger, but for his father, hyred a trumpetter to stand all the ringing while in the belfrie, and between every peak, to sound his trumpet, and proclame aloud and saye, sirres, this next peale is not for R, but for maister N,-,his father." There seems to be nothing more intended at present by tolling the Passing Bell, but to inform the neighbourhood of some person's death.

The Jews used trumpets instead of bells. The Turks do not permit the use of them at all. The Greek Church under their dominion still follow her old custom of using wooden boards, or iron plates full of holes, which they hold in their hands and knock with a hammer or mallet, to call the people to church. China has been remarkably famous for its bells. Father Le Compte tells us, that at Pekin, there are seven bells, each of which weighs 120,000 lbs.

WATCHING WITH THE DEAD.—This is called in the North of England the *Lake Wake*, a name plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon *lic* or *lice*, a corpse, and *waece* or *wake*, a vigil or watching. It is used, in this sense by Chaucer, in his "Knight's Tale :"

"Shall not be told by me 
How that arcite is brent to ashen cold, 
Ne how that there the Liche-wake was y-hold 
All that night long." 

Pennant, in describing Highland ceremonies. says, "The Late Wake is a ceremony used at funerals. The evening after the death of any one, the relation or friends of the deceased meet at the house, attended by a bagpipe or fiddle, tbe nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting— that is, crying violently at the same time ; and this continues till daylght, but with such gambols and frolics among the younger part of the company, that the loss which occasions their meeting, is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corpse remain unburied for two nights, the same rites are renewed. Thus, Scythiau-like, they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery." The custom in North Wales, we are informed by the same writer, is, "the night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, bringing with them some small present, of bread, meat, and drink (if the family be something poor), but more especially candles, whatever the family be, and this night is called *wyl nos*, whereby the country people seem to mean a watching night. Their going to such a house, they say, is *i wilior corph*, to watch the corpse ; but *wylo* signifies to weep and, lament, and so *wyl nos* may be a night of lamentation. While they stay together on that night, they are either singing psalms, or reading some part of the Holy Scriptures. Whenever any body comes into a room where a dead body lies, especially on the *wyl nos*, and the day of its interment, the first thing he does, he falls on his. knees by the corpse and says the Lord's Prayer."

The "Irish Hudibras" (1689) humorously describes an Irish wake—

"To their own sports (the Masses ended) 
The mourners now are recommended. 
Some sit and chat, some laugh, some weep, 
Some sing *cronans*, and some do sleep; 
Some court, some scold, some blow, some puff, 
Some take tobacco, some take snuff. 
Some play the trump, some trot the hay, 
Some at *machan* [a game of cards] , some noddy play: 
Thus mixing up their grief and sorrow, 
Yesterday buried kill'd to-morrow."

LAYING OUT, OR STREEKING THE BODY.— Durand, at the remote period at which he lived, gives a pretty exact account of some of the ceremonies used at laying out the body, as practised at pment in the north of England, where the laying out is called *streeking*. He mentions the closing of the eyes, the decent washing, dressing and wrapping up in a clean winding-sheet, or linen shroud, as well as other anciont observances. The interests of our woollen manufacture have interfered with this ancient rite in England. To the laying out may be added the very old custom of *setting salt*, and placing a lighted candle upon the body, both which are used to this day in some parts of Northumberland. The salt, a little of which is set in a pewter plate upon the corpse, is, according to the learned Morex, an emblem of eternity and immortality. It is not liable to putrefaction itself, and preserves other things that are seasoned with it from decay. The lighted candle, the same author conjectures to have been the Egyptian hieroglyphic for life. 

Aubrey, in some miscellanies of his, among the Lansdown MSS., at the British Museum, mentions a very curious custom at deaths, observed in a degree until his time (reign of Charles II), which he describes - under the name of *Sin-Eaters*. "In the County of Hereford," says he, "was an old custome at Funeralls, to hire poor people, who were to take upon-them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of theme (he was a long lean ugly lumentable raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layed on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl, of maple, full of beere (which lie was to drink up), and sixpence in money : in consideration he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the the sinnes of defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead." This custom, he supposes, had some allusion to the scape-goat under the Mosaical law.

FUNERAL SERMONS.— Speaking of the frequency of these formerly, and their present disuse :— "Even such a character as the infamous Mother *Creswell*, the procuress in the reign of Charles II," our author observes, "must have her Funeral Sermon." She, according to Granger, desired by will to have a sermon preached at her funeral, for which the preacher ws to have 10l., but upon the express condition that he only spoke well of her. A preacher was with some difficulty found, who undertook the task. He, after a sermon preached on the general subject of morality, and the good uses to be made of it, concluded by saying— 'By the will of the deceased, it is expected I should mention her, and say nothing but what is *well* of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this :— she was born well, she lived well, and she died well, for she was born with the name of Creswell, she lived in Clerkenwell, and she died in Bridewell."

THE MOUNTAIN DECAMERON, by J. DOWNES.

—These three volumes, which have recently made their appearance under a name, consecrated by the Patriarch of all novelists, are dedicated to the illustration of the manners, customs, traditions, and superstitions of the true children of St. David in the Principality, and seem to have originated from an impression on the part of Mr. Downes, that his fellow-countrymen of Cymri blood, owe some debt to the land of Llewellen, for not having followed, ere now,the example set by the romance writers of Scotland and Ireland. Mr. Downes has accordingly with diffidence, but zealousy withal, and not feebly, taken up his staff to tread in the footsteps Of Scott and Galt, of Miss Edgeworth and Banim. The subject of his tales, he takes from humble life in Wales, and in his narratives he displays a strong taste for the mystic and awful, a delicate sense of the workings of the human affections, and, in addition, a graphic power of description. His style is sometimes obscure and inelegant, but in general its character is simplicity, with a touch of originality. If it were for no other reason than the latter, his fictions may be read with interest. He has interspersed occasional pieces of poetry through his volumes, some of which are in no common-place vein. He has also indulged in certain colloquial papers, the dramatis persona of which are Welsh Parsons and Brothers of the Angle, and in which he treats about every thing in the world et cetera. We should, however, recommend Mr. Downes not to introduce politics into such publications, especially where his information is not more accurate than to lead him to take "the Agitator" for "a private Roman Catholic Attorney from Ireland."
