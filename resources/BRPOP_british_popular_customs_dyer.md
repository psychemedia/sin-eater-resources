Cheshire

On All Souls' Eve, both children and grown-up people go from door to door, a-souling, i.e., begging for soul cakes, or anything else they can get. In some districts they perform a kind of play as well, but in all instances the following, or a similar song, is sung : —

" You gentlemen of England, pray you now draw near  
To these few lines, and you soon shall hear  
Sweet melody of music all on this evening clear,  
Foe we are come a-souling for apples and strong beer.

Step down into your cellar, and see what you can find,  
If jour barrels are not empty, we hope you will prove kind ;  
We hope you will prove kind with your apples and strong beer.  
We'll come no more a-souling until another year.

Cold winter it is coming on, dark, dirty, wet and cold,  
To try your good nature, this night we do make bold :  
This night we do make bold with your apples and strong beer.  
And we'll come no more a-souling until another year.

All the houses that we've been at, we're had both meat and drink,  
So now we're dry with travelling, we hope you'll on us think;  
We hope you'll on nu think with your applea and strong beer,  
For we'll oome no more a-souling until another year.

God bless the master of this house, and the mistress also.  
And all the little children that round thee table go ;  
Likewise yonr men and maidens, your cattle and your store.  
And all that lives within your gates we wish you ten times more ;  
We wish you ten times more with your apples and strong beer,  
And we'll come no more a-souling until another year."

Shropshire.

In this county the inhabitants set on a board a high heap of small cakes, called soul-cakes, of which they offer one to every person who comes to the house on this day, snd there is an old rhyme, which seems to have been sung by the family and guests:

" A soul-cake, a soul-cake ; 
Have mercy on all Christian souls for a soul-cake."

The same custom is mentioned, and with very little variation,by Aubrey in the *Remains of Gentilisme* ; See N. & Q. 4th S. vol. x. pp. 409, 525.

WALES.

The people of North Wales have a custom of distribnting soul-cakes on All Souls' Day, at the receiving of which the poor people pray to God to bless the next crop of wheat. — *Pennant.*
