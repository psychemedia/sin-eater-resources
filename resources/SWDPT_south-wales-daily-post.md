CURIOUS WELSH CUSTOM.

TRACES OF CANNIBALISM IN WALES. "SIN-EATING" IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SWANSEA.

In the course of the discussion raised by the reading of Captain S. L. Hinde's paper on cannibalism at the Anthropological Section of the British Association at Ipswich on Saturday, an interesting feature connected with old Welsh social life was referred to by Mr. E. S. Hartland, of Gloucester. He said that there were traces of the olid custom eating the dead to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own country. In Upper Bavaria, when a dead man was laid out, the first thing was to bake a corpse-cake of ordinary flour. The cake was put on the breast of the dead "to rise." It was afterwards eaten by the nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peninsula an image of the dead was carried in the procession, and was eaten at the tomb, the relatives praying "God rest him!". In our own country there were traces of these customs. In Wales there was within the recollection of men still living, the "sin-eater". John Aubrey, who lived at the time of Charles II., and was a celebrated antiquary, witnessed this ceremony at Ross, in the county of Hereford. Aubrey described the man, who was a paid "sin- eater," as "a long, lean, lamentably poor rascal." It was the practice for a relative, usually a woman, to put on the breast of the dead a. quantity of bread, cheese, and beer. The "sin-eater" was expected to consume these things, and then to pronounce the everlasting rest of the departed. It was believed that in doing this he absolutely ate and appropriated to himself the sins of the deceased. The "sin-eater' was given six- pence for his trouble, and took care to get out of people's sight as soon as he oould. This practice was said to have existed in the neighbourhood of Swansea as recently as 1851, but the "sin-eater's" price had then risen to half-a-crown. Probably the greater part of the human race had passed through this phase of cannibalism. and it was, perhaps, a necessary phase of the evolution of human civilisation.

*Start to see use of "sin eater* as a metaphor. (Other examples exist but I didn't keep track of them.. bah...)

Notes and Comments

A commendable start was made yesterday with the preparations for the great regatta. The attendance at the public meeting was larger than had been imagined possible for the hour selected. Local yachting interests were largely represented, a fact made all the more agreeable by the ultimate result of the discussion.

We missed, however, the tradesmen who will derive the chief benefit from the regatta, They, at least, might have been expected to be eager that the most should be made of a great opportunity. Can it be that, inspired with implicit confidence in their townspeople into whose hands the control of the arrangements will fall, the trademen reserved themselves for the later effort to find the wherewithal? At all events, we hope to see them bulking large in the subscription list.

The preliminary skirmish for which we had been preparing the public for days came off with the best possible results, His Worship the Mayor facilitated agreement by casting overboard the preliminary meeting which had set so many teeth on edge. As usual, the press was made to serve as the sin-eater. It was gravely announced that an event widely reported --in every paper to substantially the same effect— had never taken place, and the public were invited to believe that wicked newspaper men had with one accord dreamt all the alleged facts.

It is undesirable to stir the paddle afresh, or a curious light-might be thrown on this incident. Our readers may, however, accept our assurance, given in all good faith, that the local press did not invent a single detail of that preliminary gathering, but each paper received the information independently from - but let the curtain descend, since somebody had to shoulder the blunder, and the press is accustomed to fill tho office of scape- goat.

One of the happiest circumstances attending the meeting was the brush over the title of the regatta. Grievances are better threshed out face to face than allowed to produce a silent fester none the less mischievous because unrecognised officially. The challenge of the title elicited a prompt and unmistakable demonstration in favour of retaining for Swansea that which had been won by Swansea. Mr. R. B. Lindley voiced the general feeling— its determination not to yield up to any section that which belonged to the whole community— its desire to rally to tho common cause every particle of influence capable of contributing to success. Mr. Griffith Thomas was quick to bring the matter to a head, and a practically unanimous vote dissipated all doubt regarding the view which prevailed.

Having nailed the Swansea colours to the mast the meeting proceeded to show how earnestly it sought to remove all reasonable cause of offence by the generosity of the treatment accorded the local yachtsmen who had been disposed to give a sinister interpretation to the change of title. There can be no two opinions respecting the generosity. It was so thorough that the members of the Bristol Channel Club cannot withhold their earnest support without loss of dignity and public respect. The whole incident ought now to be considered finally and happily closed and the long pull, the strong pull, and the pull all together should be a certainty.

Fault will doubtless be found with the committee selected, especially by those who did not attend to assist in making it less defective. of perfection are seldom practicable, and the committee in the exercise of its powers of addition may be trusted to repair the more obvious omissions. The main thing to remember is that the solitary rock which interfered with a clear course has been removed, and that the first-class yachts already promised ensure for Swansea the distinction and the practical benefit of the finest race ever seen in the Bristol Channel. We have now the ball at our feet, and unless singularly unfortunate or singularly incapable in our dealings with the owners of the yachts and the general public, weshould make the first of the great regattas of Swansea merely the fore-runner of many more in the years to come. All the natural advantages are here; it remains to be seen whether the necessary nous is also available to turn favouring cicumstances to account.
