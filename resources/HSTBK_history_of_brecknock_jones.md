Some Superstitions

...

The corpse candle, which precedes the death of some person in the neighbourhood, and marks the route of the funeral from the house of the deceased to the church is a common topic among our peasantry, who beheve it confined to the diocese of St. David's: a tradition is likewise very commonly received among them, which preserves the memory of certain extraordinary and wonderful feats of strength, performed by two oxen of prodigious size, called "ychain banog," or the oxen of the summits of the mountains. Davies in his *Celtic Researches* calls them "elevated oxen," and supposes them to allude to a sacrifice made by Hu gadarn or Hu the mighty; but whatever may have been the origin of the legends told of these oxen, the tradition seems to have been derived from the *Mythology of the Druids*, and in some measure confirms the antiquity of the Triads, from whence it is evidently derived.
