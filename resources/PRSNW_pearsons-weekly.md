THE SIN EATER.

AMONG the many traditions connected with deaths and funerals which exist in Great Britain, may be mentioned the strange office of "sin eater," held by an old man on the Welsh border.

When a person died notice was given to him, and he at once went to the house of the deceased. A cricket, *i.e.*, a stool, was brought, and he sat down in front of the door.

A groat, a crust of bread, and a full bowl of ale were given to him, after which he rose and pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.
