THE Rev Silvan Evans, B.D., has written the following letter to the Academy :— Llanymawddwy Rectory, Merioneth November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy* November 6th, (p 478) I find an extract from an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death; and this functionary it is added, is currently called a "Sin eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altoger unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends. D. SILVAN EVANS."

We referred in one of our letters to an important accusation made against us at the Academy in that we have such a sense of sin and eater in our burials. In reply to the Rev. D Silvan Evans, the accuser states that the case was under consideration by the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow, in 1852, when one said Mr. Moggridge to the over-zealous cause where, within five years, at or near Llandebie, Carmarthenshire. In our charge, it was said that the practice in Wales is present, but when the test is called for it will go back to a maximum of 30 years. 30 years in this period is more than two hundred years ago. But although he returned to 1847, he could not tell us whether in Llandilo, Cwmdwr, Pontarddulais, or elsewhere, the event took place in or near Llandebie. But though he did specify a time and place, we assure him, Mr. Moggridge, and everyone else, the circumstance did not take place there in the memory of the older inhabitants. It is customary in some places in Wales before the departure of the body from the house to take beer and cakes to the essentials, before collecting to assist in digestion; and it is very likely that the scholar Moggridge assumed this to be the custom of his own nation. It is very interesting to see a few superficial and fast antiquaries discussing some topics. Great care must be taken with things that hold a close connection to the character of a nation. Many failings belong to us as Welshmen, and we turn our backs eagerly to the scourge, but we are not to be insulted for things or belonging to us, and that is by a nation whose sacred land is sacred to superstition.

THE "SIN EATER" IN WALES.

*To the Editor of the Aberystwyth Observer.*

SIR.—The old saying is very true "if you want to hear news you must go from homo." Now we have received a strange piece of news, that we have a "Sin Eater" in connection with funerals in Wales. Some years ago, I was employed by an eminent antiquary to collect old Welsh legends, traditions and customs. I have made researches in almost every parish in South Wales but I never heard of the "Sin Eater."

We are told this custom prevailed at Llandebe, in Carmarthenshire.

I went to reside in that village in 1850; and I lived there for six years. My avocation brought me in contact with all the parishioners I knew them well, and I am well acquainted with the history of the place, its customs and traditions. I attended many funerals, but this Sin Eater never cropped up; and I never saw cakes distributed at funerals.

The Welsh people are, it is true, in some localities a little tainted with superstition, as to ghosts &c., but they are not so superstitious as the importations who cross the "Severn Sea" to South Wales they are too well acquainted with their Bibles as to believe in such a thing as a "Sin Eater."

We are told that this was maintained at the Cambrian Society's meeting held at Ludlow in 1852; if such trash as this be accepted by antiquarians as facts, their knowledge of the Principality must be very limited; and I pity their ignorance of Welsh history and traditions.

I thank the Rev. Daniel S. Evans, of Llany-Mawddwy, for calling attention to this rank libel on Welshmen.

I am, sir, yours faithfully,

RHEIDIOL.

THE "SIN EATER" IN WALES.

The following letter from the Rev. Professor Evans, of the University College of Wales, appears in the last number of the *Academy*, and, the subject having attracted considerable attention in tho Principality, no apology is needed for reproducing the communication at length :—

Aberystwyth, Jan. 29, 1876.

At the risk pf exposing my "ignorance" still further, aud thereby causing additional surprise to the writer of the paper on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales" in *Blackwood's Magazine*, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. Like every other country, the Principality had, and still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-cater does not appear to be among them. Since the appearance of my former letter in the *Academy* (November 13), I have made all the enquiries I could into the subject, with the view of ascertaining whether such a personage has, or ever had, "a local habitation and a name" among us. I have spoken to many and correspondence with several persons who are known to have paid attention to the customs and traditions of the country; and the sum of their communications is, without any exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater was as novel to them as it was to me.

The writer points to Llandebie as the place where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. Matthew Moggridge at the annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852, and is "surprised" that I, who became connected with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* in 1872, should not be minutely acquainted with everything that appeared in that journal some twenty years previously. Whether I ever read the account of the Ludlow meeting I cannot say; but if I did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge's revelations had been effaced from my memory when I wrote my letter. The writer tells us that "at the meeting of the Cambrian archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for sentiments which he never expressed. The description of the sin-eater given by Mr. Moggridge is taken from Aubrey and the following are his words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the organ of the Association:—

"In Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the county where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt."

Out of this statement the author of the article makes "five years"! and by that process brings the custom down to 1847. Mr. Moggridge, in a letter dated the first day of the present year, tells me that he does "not remember anything that gives a date," and adds that "the only written account" of the sin-eater "from personal knowledge" is that of Aubrey, 'de Gentilisme'". Aubrey, if I may rely on the extracts given in the *Academy*, does not say that he was eyewitness to the performances of the sin-eater in any part of Wales, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as having prevailed at any time in the Principality; and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of the Principality and not of the English counties.

But let us return to Llandebie, the locality in which it is asserted that the custom prevailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Rowlands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author of a small volume of *Historical Notes* published about ten years ago, and at one time librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these words :—

"I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parisioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, customs, and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of the 'sin-eater;' in fact people there never give cakes at funerals. I know almost every parish in South Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth."

Letters to the same effect appeared in the *Western Mail*, which circulates very extensively in the Principality, in the *Aberystwyth Observer*, and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin-eater.

The Rev. Rees Evans, vicar of Llandebie, has favoured me with the following letter in answer to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on the part of your readers for inserting it without abridgment:—

"I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., which contained such extraordinary statements in reference to a superstitious custom supposed and alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the employment at funerals of a strange person called the 'sin-eater.' I have been the vicar of this parish for the last fourteen years; and I have known this neighbourhood well for the last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I received your letter of such a personage as the 'sin-eater.' However, with the view of arriving at the truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which appeared subsequently in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this parish, as to the probability of there having ever existed here such a functionary as 'sin-eater;' and the result of my investigation in the matter is this:- That such a custom as that alluded to in your letter never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had long conversations while investigating the matter in question tor you. One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom in his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I have made, my candid opinion is that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any credible evidence."

Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter of a century.

The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge as being still seen in some parts have no connection, or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin-eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are given for their employment. They are not uncommon, I understand, among Roman Catholics at the present day.

The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just seen, he does not state that he saw any performance of the custom among the Welsh people. Those who only retail his statements need not detain us. I leave it to others to judge what amount of credibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part. If we put implicit belief in what he says about the sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, I do not see how we can consistently refuse his evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent.

In conclusion I would remark that if the custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is somewhat strange if not "surprising," that the discovery of it has been exclusively confined to those who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the country.

THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES.

The Rev. Professor Silvan Evans, B.D., of Llanymawddwy, has contributed another letter to the Academy in disproof of the absurd statements which have been forthcoming respecting the alleged functions of the imaginary "Sin-Eater":—

THE "SIN-EATER."
Llanymawddwy, Feb. 12, 1876.

The question between the writer in *Blackwood* and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find that in his letter in the *Academy* of to-day he mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, leaving the point at issue just where it was. He stated in his article that the custom of the sin-eater prevails in north and south Wales at the present day; when I challenged that statement and asked for proof, we were told that by the present day he means some thirty years ago; and when pressed for the locality he goes under the aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebie "in the hill country of Carmarthenshire." When persons appeal to certain tribunals, they should not complain if they are sent to appear before the tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made on the spot by competent persons; and those who will take the trouble to read my last letter will see with what success. The Sin-Eater is as little known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. Now the writer shifts his ground and moves under the enlightening guidance of Murray's *Handbook for Travellers in South Wales*, to Cwm Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The compiler of that volume, whether ever "connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works" or not, states nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal knowledge of any informants, but quotes almost the identical words of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight variation as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the February number of the *Contemporary Review*, simply relates the same story over again, without any corroboration of her own. A false story does not become truth by repeti-tion, and these repetitions add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is simply waste of space to retail them.

The writer complains that I did not turn over a certain leaf in *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, where he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeologists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating was carried on at *Llandebie until five years of that time* (1852). The leaf had been turned over and read before I wrote my last letter; I turn it over again, and on it read the last utterances of Mr. Moggridge as follows:—

"Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of Sin-Eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped and the rest still retained; and as he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now."

These are Mr. Moggridge's last words at Ludlow, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it must be, as I understand him, to some part of Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to me more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my remarks do not apply. Mr Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants of the alleged sin-eating practice and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it tor granted that the "more odious part of the custom has been removed," which amounts to begging the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly admits that he never witnessed tho "horrid custom" at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs us that it "was said to have prevailed;" he does not mention his authorities, nor does he so much as hint what means his informants had of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no disrespect to him when I say that both the vicar and the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascertaining the tacts of the case, on account of their connexion with the locality and their knowledge of their vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge's opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of facts; and opinions, from whatever source they may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. The question at issue lies within the domain of fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge has any foundation on a more solid substance than "imagination all compact."

It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to "refresh" my memory respecting the various sin-bearing of the Levitical scapegoat." It is useless to argue about what may, could, or should have occurred, when we are concerned only with what has actually taken place. It is needless to expatiate on the possibility of a custom, when its existence is denied. The writer might have spared his sneering remark about the "treason" of calling Welshmen "ignorant" and "superstitions." The qualities denoted by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are not confined to the Principality of Wales; and one at least of these benighted barbarians holds that it is treason against truth to make charges that cannot be substantiated against any nation, however ignoraut or superstitious that nation may be. The writer seems to assume that it is a point of national honour," rather than any higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate groundless imputations. When "national honour" and truth go together, "national honour" is not to be contemued.

The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on account of his incognito. He need not. It is perfectly immaterial whether he retains it or doffs it; but it shall not shield him from the consequences of making statements ot questionable authenticity. He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales" but he does not tell us that his ancestors ever furnished him with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or that in his frequent visits to our benighted country he ever encountered that dread functionary. Sucn being the case, I confess to being a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees and broad acres in two or more counties, fine things as they are, to the subject we are now discussing.. More to the point is the admission that, notwithstanding his frequent travels "over most of the Principality," he has "failed to acquire its language," that language being the very key to its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, therefore, might resemble those of a blind man in quest of the beautiful.

If the writer *proves*, as he states in *Blackwood*, that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is "still surviving in North and South Wales," I shall at once confess my error, and the "national honour" shall take its chance; but if he fails to do this, he ought, in justice to the country of his "ancestry," to retract the groundless charge. He it is that has brought the accusation against it, and on him lies the burden of proof.

To the Editor of the Aberystwyth Observer.

Sir.— I have been much interested by the letters which have appeared in your columns from the pen of the Rev. Silvan Evans on the subject of that suppositious personage, the "Sin Eater;" perhaps Mr. Evans or some other reader of antiquarian tastes may be able to inform me where I can find a reliable account of funny Twm, or as others prefer to style him "Thomas Jones, Esq., of Tregaron." I am aware that a "life" of Twm has been published at Llanidloes and by a London firm, but both those books have assumed the form of Welsh novels, and it is occasionally difficult to sever the real from the imaginary. If any of your readers can help me to solve my perplexity, or assist me to genuine facts I shall be heartily obliged. I am, sir, LLIDIARDE-Y-FFYNON.

New Welsh-English Dictionary

All Welshmen students of the Welsh language will learn with pleasure that the Rev Professor Silvan Evans' Welsh-English Dictionary is now in the press, the first two sheets already been printed. The work will be published by Mr Spurrell, Carmarthen. Mr Evans English-Welsh Dictionary, published at Denbigh, was issued from the press nearly thirty years ago. The present work will be far superior to anything of the kind over attempted, and will largely supplement the previous great works.

CANON SILVAN EVANS' DICTIONARY. A MONUMENTAL WELSH WORK.

The third part of the Great "Dietionary the Welsh Language," prepared by the Rev. Canon Silvan Evans, of Llanwrin, has reeontly been published by Messrs Spurrell & Son. of Carmarthen. This part, which deals alone with the letter C. completes the first volume of this monumental work. Great and deserved praise has been accorded to Dr Murray for his immense labour on the English dictionary. Without in any way seeking to minimise that praise, I venture to say that when one considers the army of assistants who render service to the English Lexicographer, the work of his Welsh compeer, carried on through years and years of hard and constant labour, with the assistance alone of Harry Silvan Evans, M.A., will fully bear the test of the closest comparison. Wales and its language already owe much to the untiring efforts of the rector of Llanwrin; this work, when completed, will increase the obligation a hundredfold. In the "New Welsh Dictionary" minute attention has been paid to the meaning and etymology of the words, and a great many common phrases and expressions are given with copious extracts from Welsh classical authors to illustrate their use. For instance the use of the word "bardd" is illustrated by lines from the writings of Aneurin, Taliesin, Cynddelw, and Goronwy Owain, and its various significations, such as bardd telu, bardd cadeiriog, bardd gorssedog, &c., are explained by quotations from Cyfreithiau Cymru, Cyfrinach y Beirdd, Bardas, and the Iolo mss. To students of the development of the language, and to Celtic students generally, the book will simply be invaluable. It is admirably arranged, and excellently printed by Messrs Spurrell.

CHANCELLOR SILVAN EVANS.

Some time ago a movement was set on foot to secure for the well-known Welsh lexicographer a pension from the Civil List. A petition bearing the names of the most representative and influential Welshmen, aided by the signatures of gentlemen eh belonged to other nationalities, was presented to Mr BALFOUR, and we are glad to state that the efforts made to duly recognise Chancellor EVANS' services to Welsh Literature have been crowned with success. It is with sincerest pleasure that we announce that a pension of £lOO is to be bestowed on Chancellor EVANS. The CHANCELLOR, now about 80 years of age, was born at a farm called Fronwilym, near Llanarth He is thus a Cardiganshire man, and we are proud of him as one of ourselves. It is very nit,,. worthy that threa of the most distinguished Welsh litterateurs of the present day hail from Ceredigion— Chancellor SILVAN EVANS, Principal RHYS, and Mr GWENOGFRYN EVANS. Chancellor EVANS has taken an interest in Welsh literature since his earliest boyhood. Being the youngest of a family of seven children, he was his mother's pet, and he had thus ample opportunities of hearing from her a vast amount of Welsh folk lore, of which she appears to have had an enormous fund. The old lady seems to have fired the boy's enthusiasm for things Welsh. When a very young man, he turned, as most young men with a literary bias turn, to poetry. and we have almost admired many of the compositions of the early period, and very particularly the translations from the English poets. The taste for Grammar, Welsh Archaeology, and Lexicography was developed at a very early age. In many of these earlier productions of his pen he is very fond of using archaic forms and phrase which are singularly delicious to our taste. Chancellor SILVAN EVANS is a standing proof that a lexicographer need not necessarily be a Dryasdus. It is hardly possible to meet a more witty and humorous companion. His supply of interesting folk lore tales is almost unbounded. These he has collected from various sources and at various times. No Welsh student should be without 'Ystên Sioned," which the CHANCELLOR collaborated with his old friend IFON, and which we must remind litterateurs was first printed at our office, and in the very conception of which we had a hand. We have often urged the CHANCELLOR to issue some other folk lore tales of a similar kind, for we are sure they would be most acceptable to the Welsh reading public of the present day. Chancellor EVANS for several years edited the "Archaeologia Cambrensis," to which he contributed a great number of articles on archaeolegy, hisory, language, folk lore, and cognate subjects. But the great work is undoubtedly the Welsh Dictionary now issuing (though much too leisurely) through the press. This work, it is said, proved the most influential pleader of all in securing the Civil List pension. It is told that Mr BALFOUR lifted his hands in welcome and admiration when a copy of the great work was shown him. We have often referred to the work, but we cannot refrain from once more referring to this monument of Welsh scholarship. The more we look at it the more we are struck with the enormous reading that Chancellor Evans has brought to the task of its compilation. There is not a page but is rich in erudition, not a column but adds to the knowledge of the most well-informed and best-read. You can never peep into it without learning, something of the language of our country and its history. Open the volumes at random, and you are at once face to face with a store of literary wealth which will repay studying and committing to memory. Take such a word as "Cyfoeth." First came its Cognates, as Cornish Covaith; Irish, Cumact, &c; then its primary meaning, viz., a district, or region under one's rule or authority, territory, dominion. In attestation of this, there follows a series of references from the Mabinogion. Brut y Tywysogion, Buchedd Mair, Barddas, Iolo M.S.S., and William Salesbury's New Testament (Acts xxiii. 34), &c. In a sub-section there appears the phrase "Arglwydd y Cyfoeth," i.e., lord of the manor; in a second sub-section comes a new meaning, viz., "Subjects." As a secondary meaning, we have "power, puissance, dominion, jurisdiction," as in such phrases as cyfoeth nef a daiar, powers of heaven and earth; y Rhufeiniol gyfoeth, the Roman power; cyfoeth Duw, the power of God. All these meanings are well backed up by references to the ancient authorities. For third meaning we have weal, state, as for example y cyfoeth cyffredin, meaning the common or public weal. Fourthly, we arrive at the meaning riches, wealth, opulence, affluence, as in the phrases cyfoeth tiriog, landed property; cyfoeth a golud, riches and wealth; cyfoeth gogoniant, riches of glory. Those who live in our locality will now understand the meaning of the phrase by which one of our School Board districts is named — "Cyfoeth y Brenin." Look up, once more, the everyday word "dydd," and you will find five and a half columns of reading, which cannot possibly be dull to the most unintelligent. Years ago we used to see a great deal of Chancellor EVANS, and we have treasured many of the remarks on books and authors which be made in our hearing, and we have often thought that an article entitled "Silvaniana" would prove most interesting reading to all in whom the Welsh national sentiment is not defunct. We regret that our venerable friend has been for some time indisposed. We hope and trust however that the illness will soon pass away, and that he may be spared for many a year to prosecute the magnificent work to which he has devoted a long and assiduous lifetime.

"Y LLAN"

TO THE EDITOR OF THE ABERYSTWYTH OBSERVER.

Sir,— Through some kind friend's thought- fulness I am in receipt of your current issue, containing the Rev Mr Davies's strictures on the "Llan." Mr Davies is braver than a critic in the last number of the "Llan" itself, who takes the same line, and who is apparently a milkman chafing under the restriction imposed by a too paternal legislature upon smart trading. What with one thing and another an editor of the "Llan" has not too easy a time of it; but if I may judge from Mr Davis's perfectly Falstaffian powers of exaggeration, I I am not at all surprised that the poor Editor had decline his help towards settling the South African difficulty. In referring to my own humble contributions to the paper, I may state state that I have been allowed to give in the pages of the "Llan" an historical resume of tbe controversy that has at different times raged round the "Llandybie Sin-eater (I should like, by the way, to get a dated reference to what was written in your own columns in 1875 or '76 on that subject). All my notes, thus far, from the commencement in February have not occupied as much space as was allowed aie on the same subject in a single issue of the "Academy" in 18196. These contributions are in Welsh. In addition (firstly) some years igo a friend sent to the "Llan" my translation if "Bydd Myrdd o Ryfeddodau," which had appeared in the London "Guardian," and which the then editor of that famous paper was so taken with that he asked me to add some account of the original. I have (secondly) been guilty of sending a translation of the Rev Elvet Lewis's beautiful verses on the death of Mr O. M. Edwards's little boy; and (thirdly and lastly), in order to vary the monotony of my notes on the "Sin-Eater," I sent some weeks ago a little joke in English on "Poetic Plagiarism," into which I introduced a fine copy of Latin elegiacs by my son, and a well-known copy of Latin sapphics from the "Sabrinae Corolla." That is what made the "London Welshman" spill the dubious contents of his milk-can over the pages of the "Llan"—he could not abide the Latin. But to show how tastes differ, I may say that the above little joke has received the commendation of two Oxford First-class men and a Hertford and Ireland scholar. You will readily see, therefore, that my withers are unwrung by this cry of "Milk O." But what is a joke to me may, I am afraid, be considered in a more serious light by my old and respected friend "Glan Menai," whose pathetic description at the rewards of current Welsh literature deserve at least to be protected against the uncouth gibes of an ignorant assailant.

As to Mr Davies, when I tell your, sir, that "the two columns devoted to corrections" dwindle down on examination to ten lines exactly, you will, I fully believe agree with me that such exaggerations are "Falstaffian." All the penance that I shall impose upon the writer is to walk (or ride) over to Darwen Rectory, show his precious epistle to one of the best-read men in the Welsh Church, and print the Rev Morgan Hughes's verdict in the columns of the "Aberystwyth Observer."

I am, sir,

Your obedient servant.

J. P. OWEN. 72, Comeragh road, London, W.
