THE SIN-EATER.

THE earliest mention of the curious custom of the Sin-eater, formerly observed in Wales and the Welsh Marches at funerals, is found in *The Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme*, work of John Aubrey, which remained in manuscript for two hundred years, until it was for the first time issued by the Folk-lore Society ten or twelve years ago. The passages in question run as follows :

> *Offertories at funeralls.*
> 
> These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye ch. of Engl. Comon Prayer-booke : but I never sawe it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey ; but it is used over all the Counties of North-Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake & Cheese, and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingraved on it, & ye parties name deceased, whch one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps ; & this Custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales. [ ...
> 
> *Sinne-eaters.*
> 
> It seems a remainder of this custom wch lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one Cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment were brought to the minister in the Ch. porch. W. K.] [Pp. 23-4. The passage in brackets is added by Dr. Kennett. VoL. III]
> 
> In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to {hire / have} poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a Cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, wch he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scape-goate in ye old La we. Leviticus, cap. xvi, verse 21, 22. "And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate and confesse over him all ye iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fitt man into the wildernesse. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let the goat goe unto the wildernesse." This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was {observed / continued} even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian goverment : as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish, the {kinred / relations } of a woman deceased there had this Ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this Countie; as also in Brecon, e.g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custom was heretofore used over all Wales.

> * * *
> In North-Wales the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of; but there, insted of a Bowle of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke.
> 
> Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance to that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals Doles are in use, and to every one a Quart of strong and good Beer. — Cramer. [P. 35.]

Ellis, who quotes Aubrey from the MS., also reprints from Leland's *Collectanea* a letter from a Mr, Bagford giving a slightly varied account, also professedly derived from Aubrey. The letter is dated 1st Feb. 1714-5, and runs thus :

> "Within the memory of our Fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire, (for so they called him,) who pre- sently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of Bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of Ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this, he got up from the Cricket and pronounced, wdth a composed gesture, *the ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul*." [Brand and Ellis, Observations on Pop. Antiquities, 11, 155.]

The only other mention of this custom of any importance is by the late Mr. Matthew Moggridge of Swansea, at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852. His account was that "when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received his fee of 2s. 6d., and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze ; for, as it was believed that he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood— regarded as a mere Pariah — as one irredeemably lost." Mr. Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie, about twelve or thirteen miles from Swansea, as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period. [Archaaeologia Camdrefisis, N.S., iii (1852), 330.]

No explanation of this strange custom has, so far as I know, been hitherto offered, beyond Aubrey's conjecture that it has some reference to the Hebrew Scape-goat. I propose briefly to compare it with one or two other customs in this country and abroad, for the purpose if possible of tracing its origin. In doing so I will ask you to assume that, as is usual in traditional rites which have continued to modern times, we have in the custom described only a mutilated form of the original ceremony. If that ceremony was in ancient times at all widely distributed we shall probably find its remains in places far apart ; but we must not expect to find them all exactly alike. The portion of the ceremony, or the interpretation of it, which most forcibly strikes the popular imagination, and is consequently held most tenaciously in the popular memory, in one place is not always precisely that which is to be recognized at first sight elsewhere. We shall have to piece together the relics we find, first in order to show that they relate to the same rite, that they are in fact portions of the same pattern, though perhaps distorted or half obliterated, and secondly to discover what the original pattern was. Fortunately in the present case the pattern is simple, and the fragments, though few, are unmistakable in their characteristics. 
At present we will note that the rite has to do with the disposal of the dead, that the eating of food placed upon the coffin, or rather upon the body itself, is the substance of the rite, and that the belief connected with it is that by the act of eating some properties of the dead are taken over by the eater. With this general idea in our minds we may look for analogues.

In the Highlands of Bavaria we are told that when the corpse is placed upon the bier the room is carefully washed out and cleaned. It was formerly the custom for the housewife then to prepare the *Leichen-nudeln*, which I may perhaps freely translate as Corpse-cakes. Having kneaded the dough, she placed it to rise on the dead body, which lay there enswathed in a linen shroud. When the dough had risen the cakes were baked for the expected guests. To the cakes so prepared the belief attached that they contained the virtues and advantages (*Vortheile*) of the departed, and that thus the living strength of the deceased passed over by means of the corpse-cakes into the kinsmen who consumed them, and so was retained within the kindred. [Dr. M. Hoefler of Toelz, in *Am Urquell*, ii, 101]

Here we find ourselves at an earlier stage in the disintegration of tradition than in the Welsh custom. The eating is not merely that of food placed upon the breast of the dead man, and so in some way symbolically identified with him. The dough in rising is believed actually to absorb his qualities, which are transmitted to those of his kin who partake of the cakes, and, consistently with the custom requiring the relatives to eat these cakes, that the qualities transferred are not evil but good ones : the living strength, the virtues and so on of the dead are retained within the kin.

Something like this may have been the meaning of the Dyak funeral rite in which food is set before the dead ere the coffin is closed. It is allowed to stand for about an hour by the corpse and is then devoured by the nearest relations of the departed. [F. Grabowsky in *Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie*, ii, 180.] So also when a Hungarian Gipsy dies he is carried out of the tent or hut. It is then the duty of the members of his family (*Stammgenossen*) to offer to the deceased gifts, especially food and drink of various kinds which they lay beside the body, and afterwards themselves consume. [Von Wlislocki, *Volksglaube und religiöser Branch der Zigeuner*, 99.]

In the Scottish Lowlands a curious, and apparently meaningless, ceremony used to take place about a hundred years ago on the occasion of a death. It is thus described :

> "When a body has been washed and laid out, one of the oldest women present must light a candle, and wave it three times around the corpse. Then she must measure three handfuls of common salt into an earthenware plate, and lay it on the breast. Lastly, she arranges three 'toom' or empty dishes on the hearth, as near as possible to the fire ; and all the attendants going out of the room return into it backwards, repeating this 'rhyme of saining' :
>
> ' Thrice the torchie, thrice the saltie.
> Thrice the dishies toom for " loffie" [i.e., praise],
> These three times three ye must wave round
> The corpse until it sleep sound.
> Sleep sound and wake nane.
> Till to heaven the soul's gane.
> If ye want that soul to dee
> Fetch the torch frae th' Elleree [seer, or wizard] ;
> Gin ye want that soul to live,
> Between the dishes place a sieve.
> An' it sail have a fair, fair shrive.'

This rite is called Dishaloof. Sometimes, as is named in the verses, a sieve is placed between the dishes, and she who is so fortunate as to place her hand in it is held to do most for the soul. If all miss the sieve, it augurs ill for the departed. Meanwhile all the windows in the house are opened, in order to give the soul free egress... In some of the western counties, however, the dishes are set upon a table or 'bunker' (as they call a long chest) close to the death-bed ; and it is actually said that while the attendants sit with their hands in the dishes they 'spae' or tell fortunes, sing songs or repeat rhymes, in the middle of which the corpse, it is averred, has been known to rise frowning, and place its cold hand in one of the dishes, thus presaging death to her whose hand was in that dish already. The Dishaloof so far over, the company join hands and dance round the dishes, singing this burden : 'A dis, a dis, a dis, a green gris, a dis, a dis, a dis.' Bread, cheese, and spirits are then placed on the table, and, when the company have partaken of them, they are at liberty to go home." [Henderson, *Folk-lore of the Northern Counties*, 53, quoting the Wilkie MSS.]

The explanation of this Scottish rite is not quite so easy as that of some others. But I think it will be agreed that it is hardly possible to assign an intelligible meaning to it if it be not of the same order of thought as that expressed in the Bavarian, and perhaps also in the Dyak, and Gipsy rites. The empty dishes placed on the hearth, or on a table close beside the corpse, the attendants sitting with their hands in them, the completion of the performance by eating and drinking of food set on the table in the very place where the dishes have been, all point to a ceremonial banquet in which the food has a mysterious connection with the dead. There is no doubt something which this supposition does not fully explain — the sieve, for example, and the words of the songs ; but we must remember that the dishes give their name to the rite, and are bound up with its essential elements, while there can be no doubt that it is in a state of decadence. Now when a ceremonial is decaying and passing gradually out of use, the non-essential portions first drop out and are replaced by others, or altogether omitted. This, therefore, is what we should have expected to occur to this Lowland rite.

The Lowland, the Dyak, and the Gipsy rites, however, are all more archaic, and therefore more significant in form than the custom of doles of money and food at funerals, which was identified by Aubrey in the passages I have quoted, as well as by more recent writers, as a survival of the Sin-eater. That this identification is substantially correct will be seen, not only from the instances already given, but also from Pennant's statement that in Wales, "previous to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that, they present, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and require the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that is done, all present kneel down, and the minister, if present, says the Lord's Prayer ; after which they proceed with the corpse... To this hour the bier is carried by the next of kin ; a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased." [Pennant, Tour in Wales (London, 1784), ii, 338.]

It is not at all uncommon, as folk-lore students are aware, that tribal, communal, and other feasts in the last stage of their decadence come to be represented by gifts of food to the poor. The significance of the custom as related by Pennant is that the food and drink are given *across the coffin, by the next of kin*, and that if the recipients are not required to eat the bread on the spot, they have at least to drink of the liquor offered them. At funerals in Ireland a plate of snuff is placed *upon the breast of the dead, or upon the coffin*, and everyone who attends the funeral is expected to take a pinch. This custom seems to be hardly yet extinct, as I have lately spoken to eye-witnesses of it during quite recent years. In South Wales a plate of salt is still often laid on the breast of the corpse (a custom once common in a much wider area) ; and "in a parish near Chepstow it was usual to make the figure of a cross on the salt, and cutting an apple or an orange into quarters, to put one piece at each termination of the lines" ; while in Pembrokeshire a lighted candle was stuck in the salt. [*Arch. Cambr.*, N.S., iii, 330, 331.] At the opening of a coffin in St. Mary's Church, Leicester, not long ago there was found on the breast of the dead a plate made of tin which it was conjectured had contained salt. [*Rev. des Trad. Pop.*, vi, 485.] In the neighbourhood of Salzwedel, in Altmark, a spoon and dish were, among other things, form.erly put into the coffin. [Temme, *Die Volkssagen der Altmark*, 77.] It is impossible, however, to lay any stress on the last-mentioned custom, since salt is of frequent use against spirits and witches, and the articles buried with the dead may rather have been intended for use in the spirit- world than the relics of a funeral observance in the nature of a feast by the survivors. The occupant of the coffin at Leicester may have been a priest, for a paten of some inferior metal was commonly buried with a priest.

But I ought not to leave quite unmentioned as vestiges of a feast the custom which obtained in Wales as well as in England of giving small sponge-cakes to the funeral guests. In Yorkshire and elsewhere the last part of the funeral entertainment before the procession started for the churchyard was to hand round "glasses of wine and small round cakes of the crisp sponge description, of which most of the guests partook." These cakes were called "Avril bread". The word *avril* is said to be derived from *arval*, succession-ale, heir-ale, the name of the feasts held by Icelandic heirs on succeeding to property. [Atkinson, *Forty Years in a Moorland Parish*, 227 ; *Arch. Cambr.*, 4th S., iii, 332 ; *Gent. Mag. Lib. (Manners and Customs), 70 ; *Cymru Fu N. and Q.*, ii, 271, 275. See also *Antigua and the Antiguans*, ii, 188.] Many other survivals of funeral feasts might be cited ; but they would be irrelevant to my present purpose. I will only add that a foreigner, describing a nobleman's obsequies which he witnessed at Shrewsbury in the early years of King Charles II, states that the minister made a funeral oration in the chamber where the body lay, and " during the oration there stood *upon the coffin* a large pot of wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased. This benig finished six men took up the Corps, and carried it on their shoulders to the church." [Quoted, Brand and Ellis, ii, 153 *n*.]

The exhibition of cakes at the recent Folk-lore Congress included a Kólyva cake as made and used among the Greeks of Turkey. On the fortieth day after death a loaf is sent to each family of the friends of the deceased as a token of invitation to the commemorative service. The kólyva, a mixture of which the basis is boiled wheat, is blessed by the priests, and each person present takes a handful, saying, as he does so, "God rest him!" The ceremony is repeated the next day. The mourners then eat a meal together before proceeding to the cemetery with the priest to erect a tombstone over the grave. The poor of the neighbourhood, we are told, are in the evening regaled with a supper, during which their wishes for the soul of the departed are repeatedly expressed. [Miss Garnett, *The Women of Turkey (The Christian Women)*, 99.] This custom is recorded in Miss Garnett's book on the women of Turkey. More remarkable still is another custom which I do not find mentioned there, but of which she herself informed me. Cakes made of boiled wheat similar to the kólyva cakes, but without the elaborate ornamentation which covers them, are carried in the funeral procession — whether or not immediately behind the corpse Miss Garnett was not quite certain, though that is not, perhaps, very material. After the coffin has been put into the grave the cake is broken up and eaten by the mourners then and there above the tomb, each one of them pronouncing the words : "God rest him !" just as the Sin-eater pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, and just as at the nobleman's funeral at Shrewsbury the guests drank to the health of the deceased. [When this paper was read to the Folk-lore Society, the Rev. Dr. Gaster, who was present, mentioned that he had often witnessed the ceremony described, and added the detail, of which I was unaware, that images of the dead were made upon the cakes. This detail, I venture to think, strengthens my argument, though it is fair to say that Dr. Gaster did not accept this view nor my conclusion.] The eating of the kólyva on the fortieth day seems to be a commemorative repetition of this ceremony.

When we set these traditional observances side by side their meaning is transparent. The partaking of food and drink which have been placed upon, or near, the body, or the coffin of the deceased, or are delivered over the coffin to be consumed — an act, in the most elaborate of these rites, distinctly believed to convey to the persons who partake some at all events of the properties of the dead — can only be a relic of a savage feast where the meat consumed was the very body of the deceased kinsman. The solemn eating at the grave of a cake carried in the funeral procession is an analogous rite and points to an identical origin. The eating of the dead, however repulsive to us, is known by the testimony of ancient writers to have been the practice of many barbarous tribes ; and travellers have likewise found it among modern savages. [It is hardly necessary to refer to the very numerous cases recorded by modern travellers. The latest I have met with is a disgusting custom among the Bangala, referred to by Dr. Schneider, *Die Religion der afrikanischen Naturvölker*, 135.] In particular, Strabo records it of the ancient Irish, telling us that they considered it praiseworthy to devour their dead fathers. [Strabo, *Geog.* Bk. iv, c. 5, s. 4.] The inhabitants of Britain were at that time, as he ex- pressly says, more civilized than the Irish. They had perhaps already passed beyond the stage at which this rite, in its horrible literalness, was possible. But they came of the same stock as the Irish, in so far at least as they both were of Celtic blood ; and it is apposite to my argument to remind you that the latest anthropological investigations seem to point to a large proportion of Celtic blood also in the people of Upper Bavaria. The inference that the ancient cannibalism related only of the Irish was once common to all these three peoples, among whom similar modern practices like those of the Sin-eater, the snuff-taking, and the corpse-cakes have been found, is well within the limits of induction. And it is confirmed by the customs, either still existent or quite recent, of the Greeks, the Scotch, and (though more doubtfully) of the Dyaks and the Gipsies, which appear to indicate the like practice among their respective ancestors.

But the strongest corroboration of the correctness of my conclusion is found in a repulsive custom, to which my attention has been called by a friend since this paper was read to the Society. This custom is practised by a number of tribes inhabiting the valley of the Uaupés, a tributary of the Amazons. Their houses are generally built to accommodate the whole community ; and the dead are buried beneath the floor. About a month after the funeral, Dr. Wallace tells us, the survivors "disinter the corpse, which is then much decomposed, and put it in a great pan, or oven, over the fire, till all the volatile parts are driven off with a most horrible odour, leaving only a black carbonaceous mass, which is pounded into a fine powder, and mixed in several large couches (vats made of hollowed trees) of a fermented drink called caxiri : this is drunk by the assembled company till all is finished ; they believe that thus the virtues of the deceased will be transmitted to the drinkers." [A. R. Wallace, LL.D., *A Narrative of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro*, 3rd ed. (1890), 346.]

The reason here expressly assigned for the custom is neither more nor less than that given by the Highlanders of Bavaria for making and eating the corpse-cakes. It is a general belief in the lower culture that food communicated its qualities to the eater. From the flesh of tigers courage and strength, speed from that of stags, timidity from that of hares, pass into those who eat them. The same order of thought leads the Taridnas and other tribes of the Uaupés to try to retain within the kindred the good qualities of a departed member by consuming his body powdered in drink. The Bavarian peasant has passed the stage whereat the coarse directness of this expedient can be tolerated. He tries to achieve the same result by the symbolical act of eating cakes baked of dough which has been put upon the breast of the dead man to rise, and has in rising absorbed his virtues. In the Sin-eater the same act is put to another, but strictly analogous, use in the absorption of the sins of the dead. *Why* it was supposed that in the one case good, and in the other evil, properties were communicated we do not know. Some variation in the view taken of the matter by the clergy may have led to the rite being considered disgraceful in Wales, and so may have rendered those who persisted in it the objects of persecution. Payment to undertake the odium, the consequent degradation as well of the rite as of the person who performed it, and the influence of the Biblical account of the Hebrew Scape-goat may have done the rest. The gifts of food to the poor, both in their intermediate form described by Pennant, and in their final form as mere doles, however, point to a different interpretation of the same original observance. They can hardly be derived from the Sin-eater ; their relation to it is not lineal but collateral. They are variants of the ceremony, and variants bearing the strongest testimony to the form and meaning of the parent type.

MR. HARTLAND'S "SIN-EATER", AND PRIMITIVE SACRAMENTS.

To the Editor of FOLK-LORE.

Sir, — Will you allow me to ask Mr. Hartland how the very interesting funeral rites which we owe to his paper on the "Sin-Eater", in the current journal, can be considered as the outcome of *one* belief, in various stages ?

I gather that he would treat as acts expressing a common idea the "sin-eating" of old English custom, where the whole gist of the usage, as celebrated by the "folk", lies in the cathartic significance, and where the celebrant has no kinship with the deceased ; the Bavarian usage, where the ritual cake is eaten by the kindred, that they may therewith receive the "virtues and advantages" of the dead kinsman, on or beside whose body the cake has lain ; the Scotch watchers' rite of placing their hands in the empty dishes and *afterwards* eating ; and the breaking and eating over the grave of the Turkish cakes.

The customs of which these seem to be typical examples are classed together as expressions of one belief; and this belief is explained as the survival of a primitive cannibalism induced by the widely-spread primitive idea that, by eating the flesh, the qualities of the man or creature may be received. How does Mr. Hartland prove that all the instances he gives, where the reception of the qualities of the dead is in no way mentioned, can be treated as resting on this special cause ; and not on that universal article of primitive creeds — perhaps one of the most necessary and sacred of all faiths to the savage mind — the renewal of the tribal kinship by the tribal sacrament of commensal eating? Most of Mr. Hartland's instances seem to point to this as their cause, and to be examples of the universal custom of offering food to the disembodied tribesman, and of preserving the tie between the dead and living by eating together in the sacrament of the common meal.

I do not like to trespass on your space by giving the full evidence which would, I think, justify me in venturing to differ from Mr. Hartland. But the importance of any point touching on primitive sacraments, and of the kind of intercourse which the undeveloped reason conceives to be possible between tribal spirits ("ghosts of worship" often) and tribesmen still in the flesh, will, I think, excuse my troubling you with these brief references, not as accumulative evidence, but as examples.

Bishop Callaway (pp. 141-44) gives ample evidence, from direct native sources, of the desire of tribesmen to "recall" — renew the bond of intercourse with — the soul of the dead tribesman. [Callaway, *Amazulu*, pp. 141-44. ] Dr. Tylor, *Primitive Culture*, ii, p. 16, refers to a commensal meal between the spirits and the tribe in yearly ritual ; and on p. 40 *seq.* he gives Mexican, Hindoo, Chinese, and Slavonic examples. [*Primiive Culture*, vol. ii, pp. 36-40 *seq.*] Dr. Codrington deals with the question of the "common participation" in the death-meal (p. 272) ; the eating of the meal by the grave (*ibid.*) ; and he quotes one case (p. 281) where the rite of placing the common food upon the body is transferred to that of placing the kinsman himself thereon. Could the kin-bond be expressed with more physical and primitive directness ? [Dr. Codrington, Melanesians*, pp. 272, 281, 283-85, etc. *]

I think it is worth noting that in Dr. Codrington's account of the details of Melanesian beliefs and practices concerning the body and soul after death, there is only one mention of the cannibalistic usages Mr. Hartland quotes (except an incidental reference on p. 28.4) ; and that in this one case the rite is performed by women, who would scarcely be selected (unless with a view to their descendants) as recipients by this means of the dead tribesman's good qualities. No mention of such design is here made, and the act in this case looks like a form of the primitive taboo, which forbids any holy thing (such, e.g., as the tribesman's blood) to fall to the ground.

The commensal meal, shared between the spirit of the dead kinsman and the survivors, seems clearly betrayed in the elapse of an hour in the Dyak rite quoted by Mr. Hartland. The Amazulu may again serve as an example of the primitive form of sacrifice, which, according to express native statement, consists in leaving the offering for an interval, *during which* the deity receives the invisible, and *after which* the worshippers eat the visible, portion. [Callaway, *op. cit.*, p. 11.] (Cf. the ghostly meal, "tamani", leaving the visible food intact upon the grave, in Melanesia, Dr. Codrington, *op. cit.*, p. 283.)

Whether the cathartic rite of "Sin Eating" has any essential connection with this tribal sacrament would seem to be a most interesting point, and would perhaps touch the question of the ethical element in savage religion ; but all that I would ask here is whether Mr. Hartland is justified in treating all the customs and rites he collects, as essentially related, and therefore as evidence for a common cause ; and whether the cause of some of these rites is not a far deeper and more significant one, than the idea which he suggests ?

Ritual celebrated among many peoples, by the kinsmen, at the death of a member of the kin, in survival or *in situ*, such as Mr. Hartland quotes, seems to me to demand a cause lying nearer to the principles of primitive tribal life, and to the primitive religious need of the individual tribesman, than a device occasionally resorted to for increasing physical or mental acquirements. Moreover, is the usage restricted to the cases of powerful or respected members of the kindred? Since Mr. Hartland finds in this usage the origin of practices which are identical in every detail with the sacramental meals participated in by the spirits of dead kinsmen and their surviving kindred, these his argument must also claim to have explained. What would Professor Robertson Smith say to this theory of the origin of the primitive sacramental meal?

If the cases quoted by Mr. Hartland of the consumption of the body of the kinsman are essentially related to the rites he seeks to explain, is it not only as the accidental condition which the universal ritual of the primitive tribal sacrament sometimes assumes?

CORRESPONDENCE.

MR. HARTLAND'S "SIN-EATER", AND PRIMITIVE SACRAMENTS.

To the Editor of FOLK-LORE.

Sir, — Miss Godden's wide reading and rapid induction have anticipated a conclusion which, when I wrote the paper on "The Sin-Eater", had definitely formed itself in my mind, but which I did not feel justified in enunciating for want of evidence. The evidence, however, is accumulating, and I hope to deal with it ere long. Meantime, it Miss Godden would be good enough to direct my attention to any facts of special interest in this connection she would be conferring a favour upon me.

An Evening Meeting was held at 22, Albemarle Street, on Wednesday, December 21st, 1892 ; the President (Mr. G. L. Gomme) in the chair.

The Minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.

The following new members were elected : Mrs. Fuller Maitland and Mr. Egerton Beck.

Mrs. Gomme exhibited some rubbings of games cut on stones found at Norwich Castle, and exhibited at the rooms of the Society of Antiquaries : (i) A Spiral Game (not at present known to survive in any modern form), consisting of a long line with a hole in the centre, and a series of smaller holes at equal distances along the line. (2) A roughly-drawn "3-squares", one inside the other. (3) The Fox and Geese game.

A printed version of the Mummers' Play, sent by Mr. W. H. Patterson of Garranard, Strandtown, Belfast, was also exhibited.

The Secretary read a short paper by Mrs. Murray Aynsley on "The Sin Eater", and a discussion followed, in which the Rev. C. Swynnerton and Mr. E. S. Hartland took part.

The Sin-Eater. —

In his work on Turkestan, [Vol. ii, p. 28.] Dr. Schuyler speaks of a custom existing in that country which is worth noting in connection with Mr. Sidney Hartland's paper on this subject in the June number of FOLK-LORE, 1892. "Life in Ach Kûrgân", Dr. S. says, "was rather dull, amusement there was none, all games being strictly forbidden. Such things as jugglery, dancing, and comic performances are, I am told, forbidden in the Kanate, the licentious Khan having seen the error of his ways, and having put on, for his people at least, the semblance of virtue. Of praying there was very little ; occasionally in the afternoon at sunset some few pious individuals would spread out a rug and make their supplications to Allah. One poor old man, however, I noticed, who seemed constantly engaged in prayer. On calling attention to him, I was told that he was an *iskachi*, a person who makes his living by taking upon himself the sins of the dead, and thenceforward devoting his life to prayer for their souls. He corresponds to the sin-eater of the Welsh border."

In Kashmir, on the borders of Central Asia, where the present writer now is, it is the *living*, apparently, who need a *sin-eater*.

We have just passed through a terrible visitation of cholera ; when the outbreak was at its worst, the deaths in the native city rose to nearly three hundred daily. An order then came from the Maharaja (who was at Jamu, his second capital [The chief town of a fief belonging to the Maharaja of Kashmir's progenitors for two or more generations before Kashmir was given over to that family]) that a couple or more bulls were to be bought, and driven for some hours round and about the streets and the lanes of the city, and then turned out loose to wander at will, in order to remove the pestilence.

It was accordingly done, and the effect this would seem to have had on the minds of the people was something marvellous ; the seizures diminished, and the death-rate suddenly declined in a most marked manner. It would appear that the Kashmiris believed either that these animals bore away the disease, or the sins and shortcomings which had brought this scourge upon them.

At Jamu itself, some years ago, the writer saw numerous ownerless cattle wandering about the native city and its environs, and was then told that these were animals which, by a particular ceremony, had had the sins of certain persons laid upon them; they looked sleek and well-fed, living most probably upon the charity of the general public.

The notion regarding the *sin*-eater in Southern Italy becomes even more directly personal, as the following anecdote serves to show. The writer had it from a Roman lady who had then resided some years in Naples, she knew one of the parties concerned, and spoke of it as a singular piece of superstition. A family of her acquaintance had settled themselves down in an apartment in that city ; not long afterwards another flat in the same house was taken by a lady whom the first-comers believed possessed the *Mal Occhio* — the Evil Eye. They were in despair, and, in order to avert any bad consequences which might result to themselves, they caused a bull to be brought to the house, and had it driven through the entrance archway, and led round and round the courtyard for some hours. There seems a remarkable connection between the sin-eater of Central Asia and of the Welsh border, the bull of Kashmir, and the Neapolitan custom.

"THE SIN-EATER."
To the Editor of FOLK-LORE.

Sir, — In connection with Mr. Hartland's article on "The Sin-Eater" in Folk-Lore for June 1892, the following occurrence at a funeral near Market Drayton in Shropshire may interest you.

The funeral took place on the first of this present month.

The minister of the chapel where the deceased woman had been a regular attendant held a short service in the cottage before the coffin was removed.

The lady, who gave ms the particulars, arrived rather early, and found the bearers enjoying a good lunch in the only downstairs room. Shortly afterwards the coffin was brought down and placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, and the mourners having gathered round it the service proceeded. Directly the minister ended, the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present across the coffin, with a biscuit called a "funeral biscuit".

One of the bearers being absent at the moment, the fourth glass of wine and biscuit were offered to the eldest son of the deceased woman, who, however, refused to take them, and was not obliged to do so.

The biscuits were ordinary sponge biscuits, usually called "sponge fingers" or "lady's fingers". They are, however, also known in the shops of Market Drayton as "funeral biscuits".

The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been.

July 27, 1893.

Gertrude Hope.

The practice of Sin-Eating, was, apparently, common in the Fens until the last decade or two of the last century. An old lady who died in 1906 has recorded how, as a young schoolmistress in Little Ouse, she learned how the sin-eater, who, incidentally, was shunned by all the villagers, qualified for the profession. She took a large dose of poppy tea to render her unconscious. Neighbours sent for the minister who, on seeing her, said it seemed she would not recover. He read the prayers for the dying and gave her absolution. Soon after his departure the woman sat up and gradually recovered. She was then assured by her friends that as she was now free from her own sins by virtue of the absolution, she was now free to take on those of others.

The sin-eater, after eating the half-round of bread and the little pile of salt placed on the shrouds of the dead, would receive as payment thirty pennies, which had been dipped in whitewash to make them resemble silver.
