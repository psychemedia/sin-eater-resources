The Manners and Customs of the Welsh

It is an opinion very prevalent within the diocese of St. David's in Pembrokeshire, that a short time previous to the death of a person, a light is some-times seen to proceed from the house, and even from the bed, and to pursue its way to the church where the body is to be interred, precisely in the same track that the funeral will afterwards follow. This light is call *canwyll corph*, or "the corpse candle."

A strange cuftom prevails in fome obscure parts of North Wales, which, however, the clergy have now almost abolished. This is termed the "offering of an enemy." When a person supposes himself highly injured by any one, he repairs to some church dedicated to a celebrated saint, or one who is believed to have great power over the affairs of men ; here kneeling on his bare knees before the altar, and offering a piece of money to the faint, he utters the most virulent and dreadful imprecations, calling down curses and misfortunes on the offender and his family even for generations to come. Sometimes the offended persons repair for the same purpose to some sacred well, dedicated to a saint. Mr. Pennant was threatened by a man, who fancied he had been injured by him, "with the vengeance of St. Elian, and a journey to his well, to curse him with effect."

The Manners and Customs of the Welsh

It is usual in several parts of North Wales, for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person, of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment ; and in some instances for weeding and adorning it, on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals, for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called *Diodlys*, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where at the same time the body is standing on a bier. It had its name from the custom, which is now discontinued, of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. — When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord's prayer ; after which they proceed with the body to the church. Four of the next of kin take the bier upon their shoulders ; a custom which is considered as expressive of the highest mark that even filial piety can pay to the deceased. If the distance from the house to the church be considerabie, they are relieved by some of the congregation ; but they always take it again before they arrive at the church. — I have been informed that in some parts of the country it is usual to set the bier down at every cross-way, and again when they enter the church-yard, and at each of these places to repeat the Lord's prayer.

In some parts of Wales it was formerly customary for the friends of the dead to kneel on the grave, and there to say the Lord's prayer for several Sundays subsequent to the interment, and then to dress the grave with flowers. — It was also reckoned fortunate for the deceased if a shower of rain came on while they were carrying the body to church, that his coffin might be moistened with the tears of heaven.
