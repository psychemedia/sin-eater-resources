Mr. E. Sidney Hartland, formerly of Swansea, the author of "The Science of Folk-Tales," at a joint meeting of the Cymmrodorion and Folk-Lore Societies the other day, dealt with the curious and interesting customs connected with the being known as "the Sin-Eater." The earliest mention of the custom of "sin-eating" formerly observed in Wales and the Welsh marches at funerals, is found in *The Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme*, a two centuries' old manuscript of John Aubrey's, published some ten or twelve years ago by the Folk-Lore Society. He says, in referring to offertories at funerals, " But before, when the corps is brought out of doores, there is cake and cheese, and a new bowle of beere, and another of milke, with ye Anno Dni. ingraved on it, and ye parties name deceased, which one accepts of on the other side of ye corps, and this custom is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales." That some such custom was observed throughout Wales in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appears to be undoubted. The late Mr. Mathew Moggridge, of Swansea, mentioned the custom at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, held at Ludlow in 1852, and specified the parish of Llandevie, about 12 or 13 miles from Swansea, as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period. Mr. Hartland compared the custom with others of a similar character in this country and abroad. Placing these traditional observances side by side, he came to the conclusion that they could only be the relics of a savage feast, where the meat consumed was the very body of the deceased kinsman. The reason for the custom is doubtless to be found in the belief that the qualities of the food are communicated to the eater. In some of the customs mentioned the virtues of the deceased were supposed to be absorbed; in others, the custom meant the absorption of the sins of the dead. Some variation in the view of the matter taken by the clergy may have led to the rite being considered disgraceful in Wales. It has long since disappeared, though gifts of food to the poor and doles at funerals may be considered as interpretations of a different kind of the original observance.
