Bundling. —At the Carnarvon Assizes two actions arising out of the curious Welsh custom of " bundling" were tried before Mr Justice Coltinan. Thomas v. Pritchard. This was an action brought to recover damages for the seduction of plaintiff's daughter. In the summer 1838, the defendant, who was a small shopkeeper, became intimate with the daughter of the plaintiff, a poor ' widow, and, after a short interval from the commencement of the acquaintance, was admitted to such terms of 1 familiarity as to be allowed to " bundle" with Ellen Thomas, the person whose seduction was the cause of the ' present action. It appeared by the evidence, that this ' practise of " bundling'' general in Wales, and is the recognised mode of courtship. The suitor visits the house of his inamorata by night and participates her bed with her, without, however, undressing, and thus carries on courtship which generally ends in marriage. In the present instance, the defendant, taking an undue advantage of the opportunities thus afforded him, seduced the plaintiff's daughter, and she was delivered of female child. Verdict for the plaintiff, £ 12.— William* v. Owen. This was a case very similar to that reported above. The plaintiff was a small farmer and a tailor, and rigid Calvinistic Methodist, and the defendant a quarryman and the owner of a small farm. The plaintiff's daughter was the eldest of seven children, and, after three years' ''bundling," gave birth to child. Verdict for the plaintiff, damages £15.
