THE RED DRAGON [1] In fulfilment of the promise we gave last week to notice at greater length the contents of the number of the National Magazine of Wales, ...

The Sin Eater is a capital little paper by Mr. Askew Roberts, Oswestry, in which the personage in question, much though he has been exercising the minds of English writers, is shown after all to be a myth.

WELSH MORALITY

AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN ON WELSH "BUNDLING."
THE "BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL AND ITS CORRESPONDENTS.

From time to time astounding instances reach us of English ignorance with regard to Welsh national habits and customs. Not many months ago a note in the Red Dragon calling attention to a silly statement anent "The Sin Eater" by the Rev. Paxton Hood in his book on "Christmas Evans" was the means of eliciting from Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P., an accomplished antiquarian, of Oswestry, a most able paper, in which the whole myth was so triumphantly demolished that many a warm Welshman must have felt tempted to apply to its promulgatoin the words used by Giffard to another equally superficial observer, old John Aubrey. Perhaps it was too much to expect strict accuracy on Welsh matters of a writer like Mr. Paxton Hood, who once described Llanidloes as "the home of the *really great poet*, John Dyer," and, *mirabile dictu!* spoke of Grongar Hill as "a delicious spot in that neighbourhood." Mr. Hood, with the usual lightness of a professional bookmaker, appears to have hashed up the story of "The Sin Eater" from Murray's "Handbook to South Wales," without troubling himself to alter much of the phraseology, still less to inquire into the existence of the revolting custom either now or at any time past.

It becomes our duty to call attention to an even worse example of ignorance, because exhibited by a person accustomed by his ordinary pursuits to greater accuracy, both of investigation and of thought, than a mere *raconteur* like Mr. Hood. In the *British Medical Journal* of April 14 this year appeared the third of the Gulstonian Lectures on "The Sterility of Women," delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in February, 1883, by J. Matthews Duncan, M.D., LL.D.,&c. Physician-Accoucheur and Lecturer on Midwifery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of the heads of the lecture deals with the sterility alleged to be "dependent on some inscrutable incompatibility of the parties, as in Augustus and Livia, Napoleon and Josephine," after which follow certain observations which, however proper to a professional journal, would be decidedly out of place in one like our own. These directly lead up to a statement "that religion, morals, and law continue to interdict the cure that might result" from the adoption of a natural method indicated by the lecturer. And immediately afterwards comes the following assertion, infamous in its purport and astonishing in the information it conveys, which we have reluctantly felt compelled to reproduce in full:-

"Unfortunately, however, among large classes - chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland — custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatability. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohabit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage tie is made. A woman proving sterile may be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."

Now, we do not wish to characterise this as a wicked invention from first to last, because we are perfectly well aware that there have been some absurd notions afloat with respect to the Welsh custom of bundling," which may have had some slight substratum of fact. But what we do say, and say most emphatically, is that the custom, whenever and wherever it might have prevailed, was not the infamous thing here described. If the facts were investigated we unhesitatingly assert that they would disclose no more harmful a state of affairs than is witnessed in every day courtship in English or Scotch life. Indeed, if the decision were left to us, we should say that, as compared with the blue-china and stained-glass window attitudes of those languishing youths and maidens with whom Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan have made us acquainted, those adopted by the Bundlers (whom we admit, for the sake of our illustration, to exist) are much the more whole- some of the two. That such an infamous imputation against the morals of Welsh parents and Welsh children should have been uttered or printed without careful inquiry into the facts is almost inconceivable. That such an abominable accusation should have been allowed to pass unchallenged would have been less conceivable still. We were therefore pleased to find the cudgels taken up with some warmth on behalf of the Welsh people by Mr. E Rice Morgan, Morriston, who, in a letter to the editor of the *British Medical Journal*, printed in its issue of May 5, says:—

WELSH MORALITY.
SIR, — On page 702 of your journal for the 14th instant, Dr. Matthews Duncan states thus:- "Unfortunately, however, among large classes chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland — custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatability. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohabit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage is made. A woman proving sterile may be deserted j by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."

I know the habits of the Welsh well, and though they are far from what could be wished, there is no such practice as Dr. Duncan alludes to. To make such a statement and allow it to be printed is a gross moral blunder. I would suggest to Dr. Duncan to examine more closely into the morals of his own country. Let him examine and compare the statistics of illegitimacy there and here. I should be glad to see them printed.- Yours obediently, E. RICE MORGAN.

This communication attracted the notice of Dr Dd. Thomas, Ystalvfera, who, thinking the charge made by Dr. Matthews Duncan should not W allowed to remain without a further attempt at refutation, also wrote the editor a letter on the subject, but beyond an acknowledgment of its receipt no further notice was taken of it in the columns of the *British Medical Journal*. Through the courtesy of Dr. Thomas we are enabled to publish a copy of this letter. It is as follows :—

TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL.

SIR,—I am glad to find my friend, Mr. E. Rice Morgan, has entered his protest against the odious and unwarrantable statement made by Dr. Matthews Duncan as to Welsh morality in his a dress on "Sterility," as published recently in your journal (*vide* page 702, April 14).

I have lived nearly all my life in Wales, and from what I know of the habits of the people I am glad of this opportunity to endorse every word that Mr. Morgan says.

Between the Judge-Advocate-General (who claims to represent in Parliament the opinion of the Welsh Principality) saying "that the Welsh people hated tests more than they hated Atheists and Dr. Duncan's infamous accusation as to tho existence of "bundling" in Wales, I fear our friends beyond Offa's Dyke will credit us with a less degree of civilisation than what they have hitherto done. True, nearly all the Welsh members voted for tho Bradlaugh Relief Bill; but I am satisfied that many did so more for the sake of following their leader than of representing the voice of their constituents. And I fear Dr. Duncan made his reckless statement more with the view of writing a sensational paper than of putting before the public a plain statement of facts.

On reading over Dr. Duncan's address, and particularly that part of it with reference to "bundling," I could not but be struck with the recollection of a little pamphlet which appeared in Edinburgh some twenty years or more ago called "The Mysteries of the Temple," "By an Acolyte." This production was supposed to be a take-off on the then practice of the late Sir James Simpson; but, as it was written with little or no regard for truth, it was suppressed after but a short existence. For my own part, and for the sake of the reputation of my countrymen and countrywomen, I would be glad to find a similar fate befall Dr. Duncan's address rather than it should be the means of disseminating broadcast such erroneous statements as it contains, and thereby branding a whole nation with gross immorality.—I remain, sir, your obedient servant, DD. THOMAS, M.D.
Ystalvfera, 7th May, 1833.

This letter was not a whit too scathing in view of the aggravated character of the charge to which it was intended as a reply. That it was refused insertion may not impossibly be taken as only another instance of how very much more ready the owners of some English minds are to give currency to any scandalous rumour, no matter how flimsy and untrustworthy, concerning their Welsh neighbours than to afford the latter a full and fair opportunity of self-justification. Whatever the editor of the *British Medical Journal* may have thought of Dr. Thomas's letter, we are quite sure that all Welsh people, and all right-minded English people as well, will feel thankful to the Doctor for having written it. The Duncans and the Paxton Hoods of the country are people who must taught that they cannot malign their neighbours, whenever it pleases them, with impunity.

The Week

The interesting discussion which followed Captain Hinde's paper on cannibalism before the  anthropological section of the British Association at Ipswich on Saturday brought to light one or two facts connected with Welsh social life which are entitled to a passing notice. Mr. Hartland, of Gloucester, referred in, the course of his comments to an old custom which obtained in Wales in times gone by, and which was called "sin-eating." As late as 1851 traces of it still survived in the Swansea Valley, and it would be worth while inquiring whether they have completely disappeared. The "sin-eater" was the individual who literally "took the cake" at the death of a neighbour, and in consuming it was supposed to "eat" the sins of the deceased. The custom was a relic of barbarism, and shows with what tenacity old beliefs and institutions hold on. The student of man and his ways must feel regret that so many ancient customs and usages have been relegated to oblivion, beyond any possibility of recall. But it was hardly expected that they should have survived in a country like Wales, which has given itself over to the Sunday school and the Bible. It is a mistaken policy, however, to drive out ancient customs, for they form links between the present and the past, and relieve modern social life of much of the monotony which enters into its very texture.

Notes


"DISHYLOOF"

In Chambers's "Pocket Miscellany" (v., 1852) there is an interesting paper on "Latewake Entertainments," reprinted, probably, from one of the old folio issues of "Chambers's Journal." From this paper I quote the following:— "The most remarkable thing about the old Scotch funeral customs was the high degree of joviality which prevailed... At these late-wake, which were universal through the country, an immense deal of viands was consumed... A game, of which we do not know the exact nature, but which was called 'Dishyloof,' was played, and the feast continued for upwards of two days. On other occasions, we have heard, the young people of both sexes would engage in games of forfeits..."

 The term "Dishaloof" is given in Dr. Wright's "English Dialect Dictionary," but nothing is said there of its being connected in any way with "funerals." It is described as played thus: One places his hand flat on a table, another places his on the other's, a third on the second's, &c., and the game seems to be one of endurance simply (I am depending on my memory). It is suggested in the "English Dialect Dictionary" that the derivation of the name is from the "dashing" of hand on hand. It was stated by Professor Rhye, in the course of the controversy respecting the so-called Welsh "Sineater" in the Academy (Nov., 1895). that the earliest dictionary form of "Diodlys" he had seen is "Diodlifft." At the time I attached no importance to the variant, thinking it a misprint for the old long "s," but, in face of the above quotation from Chambers's Miscellany, I now half suspect that "lifft" may have been right, and that the Welsh word "Diodlys" and the Scottish "Dishyloof" are corrupted variants of the same term, whatever that may have been.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Å column of the Times" of Monday was occupied with a letter from Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. Highgarth, Gloucester, on the subject of "The Sin-eater in Wales." The letter is written in answer to another correspondent, Mr. N. W. Thomas, who denied the existence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the "Academy" twenty years ago and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World of February, 1882. Mr. Hartland claims that neither of these denials can outweigh the positive statements he cites in the earlier portion of his letter.

Three significant and outstanding facts came into light as the result of the search which tended to destroy all hope in the breasts of some of the searchers, facts which made it extremely difficult even for Hywel himself to go on asserting that he felt quite certain that Nell was still alive, whatever had happened to her. The first of these was the fa.ct that Master Francis Lloyd had never been seen at Maesy- felin after the morning he had been visited there by the Old Vicar and Mistress Owen. The second that there was a deep wound on the left side of Samuel Pritchard's head when his body was found in the Towy, show- ing—indeed, proving—that violent hands had robbed him of his l'iff- The third, and, by far, the most disturbing of the three, was the verified fact that Shon Jones bad been released from Northampton Gaol through the powerful influence of his father. Every clue furnished by these facts had been followed by Hywel and his friends to the utmost of their abilities, but still there was no trace of the missing girl. Francis Lloyd was found to be in London attending assidu- ously to his Parliamentary duties and hardly ever leaving his town house. The mystery of Samuel Pritchard's death seemed to deepen the more it was looked into. But the greatest mystery of all was that connected with Shon Jones. Hywel went straight, upon reoeiving the news of his release, to Ystrad Ffin. There he learnt from his father, who showed him the utmost kindness and sympathy and acted throughout like a born gentleman, notwith- standing the wild escapades of his younger days, that his youngest son had completely lost his reason while in gaol, owing, so the physician asserted, to the dog-bites he suffered from when he entered. As he would be a harmless witling for the rest of bis life, the authorities gave him bis freedom, "whioh," he added with a sigh, "he has enjoyed by roaming about the country, a perfect ghost of his former self, living the life of a nomad, and performing the horrible functions of a Sin-eater, in which some Papist fools have encouraged him." 

...


Suddenly the speakers eye caught sight of a strange figure approaching the.con- gregation at a slow, measured pace, as if the elements of time and distance had never entered any of his calculations. Hywel thought, as he observed his shuffling gait, he had never, even among the veriest rustics and groundlings of the most untamed communi- ties, seen such a. tatterdemalion. H» face not only dirty, but grimy, and his hair seemed matted together with dry mud. When he was within a few yards of the small crowd, .someone looked back and recog- nised him, and he had no sooner done so than he took to his heels as if he had just Miieht sight of the most dreaded object in Vrtinj wild? a,, he ran, "Th.] Sin-Eater! The Sin-^ter!! In half a minute every man, woman, a.nd child had vanished. a.nd the evangelist found himself alone with Huw Merlyn and this strange being, who stood mumbling to himself as if quite uncon- scious of any other presence. Suddenly Hywel darted forward and pipped the scruoby loon by the shoulder. Shon Jones, he said, what have you done with Aell Owen?" Something in the tone of the speaker or in the name he pronounced seemed to rouse the miserable creature for an instant, and the shadow of a sane look passed over his face, but it vanished as scon as it appeared, and the dull, lack-lustre eye gazed back unmoved into his' questioner's fierce and feverish gaze. "Nell Owen?" he answered in a far-off, un- earthly voice. "The maid is safe at last, safe at home. No one Can ever find her again. No one ca.n ever know. Ah, yes! the maid is safe at home at last." And a look of malevo- lent cunning came into the witless face as he seemed to glory in repeating the words, "No one can ever know. Hywel trembled like a reed as he M-ard the ominous and seemingly triumphant declaration of the ba.bbler; and for the first time since the disappearance of his loved one he feared she was d-^ad. The very thought so blanched his face that Merlyn took hold of his arm to support him. But so intent was he on reading Shon's soul that he never took his eyes from his lips. Presently those lips opened again, and he added in the same harsh, husky voice: Yes, yes, the maid is safe. The Forwyn Sanctaidd hath her. I found her in the night under the tree, and I took her home myself. No one can ever know. She is now d»ad to the world for ever. Yes, the maid is safe at last."

"They obeyed the Church, and only the Church, and they argued that, as a faithful son of the Church, its appointed Sin-Eater in the district, had practically sacrificed his earthy happiness to his zeal to win a convert, and had brought her to the Priory without using any force- in fact, without even touching her person- she was there for aye, and they had no power to restore her to the world even if they wished.

Of course, my head was not always right until the dog's bite, and the prison doctor and the priest put it. But it is right now: I am atoning for ail my sins and my father's sins and my grandfather's sins as a Sin-Eater. The people are beginning to know me, and they send for lie, though they are terribly afraid of me. I sit at a little stool by their doors, when they bring out their dead, and all eyes are on me, and everyone holds his breath in terror when I take the bread off the breast of the corpse and eat it and drink the beer in the bowl they place on the bier by its side, and their hairs stand on end when I take the groat from the dead one's nearest relative, and say, with my face close to that of the corpse: 'I take thy sins upon my own soul; let thine rest at ease for ever, and let mine suffer its penalty.' And when the gipsy Princess dies, and when you, beautiful Nell, die, I shall take all your sins, and neither of your spirits will have to walk-"

"Oh, Shon," she cried out, "you frighten me terribly! I do not understand you. Did you say that you came to take me home?" 

"Home? Oh, yes. And you must be there in safety until you die. Then I will come and eat your sins –"

"Shon! I don't understand you; let me go home."

"No, no, I must take you. And I forgot; I mustn't touch you, though I think I did just now. No, no. I must not touch you - at least, not until you are dead, than-"

"I can go home quite well now, if you will let me."

"No, no, follow me; I have a house and two horses over yonder. You will ride one horse and I the other. And I will take you home. Yes, yes, home. But I must not touch you. Follow me, beautiful Nell."

She was now perfectly aware that the poor fellow was thoroughly off his head. But, though some of the strange things he said made her flesh creep, she was no longer afraid of him. She felt quite certain he was not acting a part, and she made up her mind to humour him and follow him, so that by his aid she might get home and be out of danger.

Presently, they came in sight of an old ruin by a roadside. As far as Nell could see its outlines in the darkness, there were several apartments, but the roof had fallen in, the doors and the window casements were wanting, and the whole place seemed God-and-man-deserted!
