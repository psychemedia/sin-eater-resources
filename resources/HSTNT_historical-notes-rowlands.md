Rowlands writes of Llandebie:


In the Churchyard of Llandebie there are some curious epitaphs to be seen, but of late years great improvement have taken place in the style of the tombstones and the epitaphs, &c. Unfortunately the literature of the Churchyard is left entirely in some parishes in the hands of the village sculptor, who changes the epitaphs to suit his own taste and purposes. Books, skulls, spades, urns, &c., are the emblems which are to be seen in our country Churchyards, particularly in the vicinity of the ironworks. Such emblems are more appropriate on the tombs of pagans than Christians. There are not many Churches in the county so well attended as Llandebie. We are glad to find that it is intended to erect a Chapel of Ease in this parish, as the distance is far from the parish Church. Some years ago a New National School-room was opened here. We remember that morning well, when a crowd of young ones, with shining morning faces, were skipping cheerfully to school for the first time. Where is that light hearted group now? Some are grown up to manhood, and others lying in their graves. This school has been carried on with great success since its foundation. There were several mansions in this parish, but they have been converted into farm houses, and their glory has departed. Dyffryn lies between Llandebie and Cross Inn, on the banks of the Loughor; it was formerly the residence of the Leweses, the representative of which is W. P. Lewes, Esquire, of Llysnewydd, who is descended from Ceredig, Prince of Ceredigion. Aberlash, the residence of the Evanses, who are now extinct, is at present a farm house. Glynhir, the residence of William Du Buisson, Esq., stands on a hill which commands an extensive view of the surrounding country. Close to Glynhir there is a beautiful fall formed by the Loughor.

"Smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood  
Rolls fair and placid, where, collected all,  
In one impetaons torrent down the steep  
It thuad'riug shoots and shakes the countxy round.  

Blyne, or Blaenau, the residence of an old and highly respectable family of the name of Davies, is at present the property of David Prothero, Esq., M.D., the representative of the family. A short distance from Blyne there is another neat little mansion, Cwmcoch, the property of the same family. Plâs, stands in the village of Llandebie; this building was very large and extensive, but it has met with the same fate as others, having been converted into a farm house. We have heard that this place belonged to a family of the name of Phillips; one of them was a "mighty hunter" in his day. Derwydd, the residence of the Vaughans,

whose names are frequently and hononrably mentioned in the 
annals of the county. We have been informed that there are some 
beautiful carvings to be seen still in this house. The Derwydd 
estate belongs to Mr. Qulstone at present, who descends from that 
femily. Piode appears to have been once a house of some note. Many 
years ago an excellent grammar school was c€u:ried on here by the 
late Mr. JEvans, where a great many gentlemen belonging to this 
and the adjoining counties were educated. It is supposed that 
there were two chapelnes in this parish, but there are no remains 
of them standing at present. A short distanoe from the village 
stands a steep hill called ** Dinas," the summit of which is quite 
level; it is very propable that it is the site of an old military en- 
campment. The view from the top of this hill is delightful; on 
the opposite side stands Oarreg Oennen Castle, standing 
majestically, in spite of the storms and the destructive hands of 
man as of yore; and on the other side the pleasant town of Llandilo, 
and Dynevor Castle. There is a large cave in this hill; and tra- 
dition says that Owain Lawgoch, and a host of armed soldiers, are 
resting in this cave. Several other places in South Wales claim 
the same honour. Some years ago several petrified bodies were 
found in this cave. These bodies are to seen in the British 
Museimi. It is supposed that they took refuge in this cave, the 
mouth of which was closed. Llandebie waa the birth place of 
John Jones, Esq., barrister- at-law, an eminent lawyer, &c. This 
proves the old Welsh saying, — ** Yn mhob gwlad y megir glew." 



SiK RicHAED Steele, &c. 

Pope said, that though Steel led a careless and vicious life, yet, 
he had nevertheless, a love and reverence for virtue. The life of 
Steel was not that of a retired scholar, hence his moral character 
becomes more instructive. He was one of those whose hearts are 
the dupes of their imaginations, and are hurried through life by 
the most despotic violation. He always preferred his caprices to 
his interest, or, aooording to his own notion, — very ingenious, but

not a little absurd, — '* he was always of the humour of preferring 
the state of his mind to that of his fortune." The result of this 
principle of moral conduct was, that the man of the most admi- 
rable abilities was perpetually acting like a fool, and, with a warm 
attachment to virtue, was the frailest of human beings. 

- He enlisted as a private soldier in the Horse Guards, which 
gave great offence to his uncle, and by this foolish act he forfeited 
a good estate. His frank temper and wit extorted admiration, 
and he became the leader of all dissipations of London. Amidst 
his revelries he was often pensive, for it was in the height of these 
irregularities he composed his ** Christian Hero." When his com- 
panions found out who the author was, they slighted him. In 
order to make himself successful, as he says, in town, he sat down 
and composed a laughable comedy, ** The Funeral." 

He detected the fallacy of the South Sea Scheme, while he him- 
self invented projects neither in magnificene nor in misery. He 
wanted to coin gold merely to distribute it. The most striking 
incident of his Hfe, was his sudden marriage with a young lady 
whom he saw in his wife's funeral. Although he wrote an essay 
on the choice of a wife, he united himself to a lady whose charac- 
ter was most uncongenial to his own. She loved money — ^the 
companion of vice — dearly; her temper every day grew worse by 
the perpetual imprudence of her husband. 

His second wife was Mary, daughter of Jonathan Shurlock, of 
Tygwyn, Llangunnor. Tygwyn has been converted into a farm 
house many years; it is now the property of Mr. D. Buisson, 
Glynhir, Llandebie. Soon after Steele's marriage with Miss 
Shurlock, he requested her to accompany him on a visit. The 
carriage was ordered, and without informing her where he was 
going, they drove to the outskirsts of London, where they 
alighted at a boarding school, and a young lady made her ap- 
pearance, to whom he shewed the greatest affection, inasmuch that 
his wife asked him who she was. On his acknowleging that it 
was his own daugher by a relation of Tonson, a bookseller, Mrs. 
Steele answered, "She shall be mine also." 

The yoimg lady was taken home and treated as their own, and 
was called by the name of Miss Ouslep. She married a Mr.

A3mstone, of Hereford; the match was a most unsuitable one. — 
Chalmer*$ Memoir of Steele* 

Although Steele and his wife did not lead a happy life, his 
attachment to her was ardent and uniform. It appears that they 
never parted without bickerings; but he could not bear her ab- 
sence; he was in the habit of writing impassioned notes three 
times a day from his office, or frx)m his bookseller's. He would 
rise up in the midst of his dinner, and despatch a note to '* Prue," 
as he called her, to assure her of his affection since noon. Steele 
seemed to think that warm affection was all she required. She 
was left for days in solitude, without any money, when her hus- 
band could not rise any. The following note is a feeling remon- 
strance to her: — 

"Deab Wife, — ^I have been in great pain of body and mind 
since I came out. You are extremely cruel to generous nature, 
which has a tenderness for you that renders your least dishumour 
insupportably afflicting. After short starts of passion, not to be 
inclined to reconcilation, is what is against all rules of Christianity 
and justice. When I come, I beg to be kindly received, or this 
will have as iU an effect upon my fortune as upon my mind and 
body." 

In some of his letters, he sneers at Lady Steele's love of 
money: — " Your man Sam ow«s me threepence, which must be 
deducted in the account between you and me; therefore, pray 
take care of it, or stop ''it." Such letters as the following were 
sent to her three times a day: — 

** I beg of you not to be impatient, though an hour before 
you see 

Your obliged husband, 

E. Steele." 

** Deab Pbttb, — ^Don't be displeased, that I do not come home 
till eleven o'clock. 

YOUES EVER." 

** Deab Pbue, — ^Forgive me dining abroad, and let niece carry 
the papers to Buckley's. 

Your devoted, E. S." 

''Deab Pbue, — ^I am very sleepy and tired, but I could not

think of closing my eyes till I told you. 

I am, dearest creature, 
Your most affectionate faithftQ husband, 

E. Steele." 

It appears that he was obliged to give an hourly account of 
himself to his fair despot, which must have been very disagree- 
able. 

** Deab Prtte, — ^It is a strange thing because you are hand- 
some, that you will not behave yourself with the obedience that 
people of worst features do; but that I must be always giving 
you an account of every trifle and minute of my time. I send 
this to tell you, that I am waiting to be sent for again when my 
Lord Wharton is stirring." 

Such a line was insupportable, and there is no wonder that he 
grumbled occasionally. Steele passed the latter years of his life 
in the ancient and pleasant town of Carmarthen. He removed 
to Carmarthen fix)m Hereford in the summer of 1724, and died at 
his house in King-street, September 1st, 1729, and was buried in 
St. Peter's Church. It is said, that his play, ** The Conscious 
Lovers " was written at Carmarthen. He commenced *' The 
School of Action," but he could not finish it. Mr. Nicholls pub- 
lished it in Steele's correspondence. In the year 1727, he was 
attacked by a paralytic disorder, which impaired his mental facul- 
ties. In this unhappy state he would often be carried out on a 
summer's evening, where the country lads and lasses were 
assembled at their rural sports, and with his pencil, he gave an 
order on his agent for a new gown for the best dancer.
