A writer new to the world of literature, but possessed of a faculty of great power and entire originality, is on the point of producing a work of fiction, called "The Mountain Decameron." The editor of the first critical journal in this kingdom has pronounced the author to he a man of "rare genius." In selecting North Wales as the scene of his romance the writer has opened a field hitherto strangely neglected, but one which abounds in the grandest elements of fiction, whether as regards its magnificent landscapes, its striking customs, its traditionary lore, or the strongly marked character of its inhabitants.

The Mountain Decameron, a Romance of North Wales.— 

The author of these volumes has. iv in treating of Welsh scenery, manners, customs, legends, &c., broken nearly, if not quite, untrodden ground. ° Hence his "Momtain Decameron" is full of life and novelty, and will come on the experienced novel reader quite like a surprise.  The stirring native legends and stern domestic tragedies of homely Welsh life, which form the staple of his volumes, would seem to have been penned on the spot, while the feelings which they called forth were yet fresh in the author's mind, so vivid are the colourings in which he has portrayed them, and so impassioned and truth-like their character. We have observed that Mr. Downes is a superior landscape painter, but his sketches have this additional recommendation, that they are remarkable for their strict accuracy, as, in more than one instance, we ourselves can testify.— *Sun.*
