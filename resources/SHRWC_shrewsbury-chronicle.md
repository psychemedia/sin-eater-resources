THE SIN EATER.



Matthew Moggridge, Esq. then proceeded to make some observations the "Custom of the Sin Eater in Cwm Ammon Valley." The custom was this—formerly, when a party died in the district named, a person known by the name of the "Sin-eater” was called in, who placed upon the corpse a plate, with salt in it, and some bread over the salt; the "Sin-eater" then eat the bread, and was believed, by so doing, to have taken to himself all the sins of the deceased, and for which act he received fee of two shillings and sixpence. When he had accomplished his task he hurried off as fast as he could. The "sin-eater" was regarded as a man totally and irretrievably lost. He had the authority of a clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy for stating that portion of this custom had prevailed in that district until within very recent years. It did not go to the lamentable length practised Cwm Ammon, but merely comprised the plate and the salt. The custom prevailed not long ago Oxfordshire, and in Cwm Ammon it had existed until very lately. He found that about twenty years ago the plate, the salt, and the bread, were placed upon the dead at the latter place, but the "sin-eater" was not sent for ; and as they advanced towards Swansea the "sin-eater" and the bread were dispensed with, and the plate and salt only remained. In Monmouthshire they had not only the plate and the salt, but also introduced the singular practice of making the figure of cross in the salt; and they frequently cut an onion or apple into four quarters, and placed one quarter each comer of the cross. He had recently received letter from clergyman who resided the neighbourhood, in which it was stated that the custom existed in that form even to the present day. He thought he had established the fact of this horrible custom having been in operation in this island, and they ought to thankful it was not now, for if there was one thing more disgusting than another it was this custom.

Thomas Allen, Esq. observed, that in reference to this custom he was able bear witness of it another county (Pembroke), at which their association met last year. When a poor person died, a plate with a heap of salt on it was placed on the body, and in the salt was stuck a lighted candle. He should like to ask Mr. Moggridge if there was any necessary connection between the custom he (Mr. Moggridge) had mentioned and the one just named by himself. He could not exactly see it, but he did not deny it. Some persons might think it was rather Romish in its nature. He really did not quite see that there was any necessary connection between this custom and the introduction of the "sin-eater." It was quite clear in the instances mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, that he had shown only a very slight connection between the two ; he did not feel sure to whether it was necessary to connect them. The popular notion in Pembrokeshire, with reference to the placing of salt on the bodies of the dead, was that it kept away the evil spirit. It was usual, after the candle had been lighted, for the friends of the deceased to watch through the night over the body, in order that they might, by their presence, keep off the evil spirit. As regarded the salt, he thought it might be explained in this way — as an emblem of purification ; it might that the salt was for purification, and the candle for keeping the evil spirits away. This really was a subject, if any person took delight it, on which further light might be thrown; for those meetings were not only for the purpose of stating what they knew, but also to provoke discussion. He did not mean to discuss the subject now, but at a future time.

Rev. I. Burleigh James.— I think the originator of the custom is the scapegoat.

Jelinger C. Symonds, Esq. would like to know whether or not this custom of sin-eating was extinct. If not, to send missionaries abroad would be a farce, while they had customs so disgusting at home.

The President hoped they were not entering into the history of present customs, but into the history of past events. It struck him that even at the present day when that melancholy event took place, the death of an individual, there was always a certain respect paid to the corpse : it was not closed in the coffin, but was left open for a certain time for the inspection of friends ; the room was hung, the candles were lighted, and there was always a person in the room who remained during the time that exhibition took place. It was out of respect to the deceased that much ceremony took place, he could not regard it in any other light. It had been continued from time immemorial, and with every degree of respect he should entertain towards that custom there was nothing in it that he could exclaim against.

JELINGER C. Symons, Esq.- -Of course my impression was as to the custom of the sin-eater. Some part the custom appears arise out of respect for the dead.

Matthew Moggridge, Esq. said the Duke of Marlborough was the person he had alluded to. He sent for Dr. Bowles during his sickness, and when the Dr. arrived he found that the Duke was already dead, and the plate and the salt was placed on the body. Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished was to get at the truth. He thought that the jist of what fell from his friend (Mr. Allen) was that there was no immediate and direct connection between the custom of the sin-eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Cwm Amman Valley he found that the most horrible portion of the custom dropped, and the rest still remained; and as he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, told them that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire where he saw a man whom he described as the sin-eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found in the very district where Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection — that the more odious part of the custom has been removed, but the plate and the salt remained. He thought the plate and the salt was of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice now; one case occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct in the Cwm Amman Valley.

E. A. Freeman, Esq. enquired whether sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed ?

We understand Mr. Moggridge to reply in the affirmative.

After some few observations from H. Hodges Hughes, Esq., and W. W. E Wynne Esq.

The President moved a vote of thanks to Mr Moggridge, which was warmly accorded by the meeting.

Sin-eater.—

Can any of your readers explain the origin of "the sin-eater," and give instances that horrid practice still subsisting in parts of England and Wales, as I am assured it does ? It consists the proposed transfer of the sins of a person recently dead to man of reprobate character, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have released the dead man from the responsibility of his sins, and to have taken it upon himself; he then receives half-a crown for his services, and is driven or pursued from the house with execration. This practice was the subject of an interesting paper Mr. Muggridge, of Swansea, at the last annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association; but its origin was not satisfactorily traced. The scapegoat and the sacrifice of criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been suggested.—Jelinger Symons.

[The custom generally supposed to have been taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi, 21, 22. See a curious passage from the Lansdown MSS. concerning a sin eater who lived in a cottage on the Rosse highway, in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand's "Antiquities," vol ii., p. 237, edit. 1849.] —-*Notes and Queries.*

"SIN-EATER."— In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them all the sins of the party deceased, and ware called "sin-eaters." One of them, I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was thus: "When the corps was brought out of the house, and laid on the biere, a loaf of bread was delivered to the sinne eater over the oorpe, as allso a mazar bowle (a gossips bowl of maple) full of beer which he was to drink up, and six pence in mony, in consideration whereof be took upon him *ipso facto* all the sinns of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. In North Wales the sinne-eaters are frequently made use of; but there, instead of a bowl of beer, they have a bowl of milk. This custom was by some people observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government. As at Dyndar *volens nolens* the parson of the parish, the relations of a woman deceased there had this ceremony punctually performed according to her will. The like was done in the City of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept many years before her death, a mazar bowl for the sinne-eater ; and in other places in the county, as allso at Brecon, at Llangors, where Mr. Govin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder this superstition. Methinks doles to poor people, with mony at funerals, have some resemblance of the sinne-eating. Doles at funerals were continued at gentlemen's funerals in the west of England till the civil warrs, ; and so in Germany, at rich men's funerals, doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good beer."
