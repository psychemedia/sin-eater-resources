The following are matters which the author ascribes to the middle ages, at least he can assign no earlier date.

The first is the singular custom, now obsolete, of *Sin-eating*.

It appears, that so late as the seventeenth century, there was in the villages, adjoining to Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed; Ellis, the editor of the Popular Antiquities has extracted the following curious passage from the Lansdowne Manuscripts, concerning a *Sin-eater*, who "lived in a cottage, on Rosse highway."

"In the county of Hereford was an old custom at Funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the house, and layd in the Biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the Corps, as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up] and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof lie took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old lawe, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22. " And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their: transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goate, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the Goate shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the Goate goe into the wilderness,"

This custome (though rarely used in our day,) yet by some people was observed, even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the Parish) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her will; and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. [Popular Antiq. ii. 156.]

...

Formerly flowers were strewed before young couples, in their way to church. The author once saw a malicious caricature of this custom. Nosegays of rue enclosing a piece of half-eaten bread and butter were dropt in the church-path and porch by a deserted female, in order to denote an unhappy wedding. Stephens, in his plaine Country Bridegroom, p. 353, says "He shews neere affinity betwixt Marriage and Hanging ; and to that purpose, he provides a great Nosegay, and shakes hands with every one he meets, as if he were now preparing for a condemned man's voyage. [Popular Antiq. ii. 48]
