TWO FOLK-LORE BOOKS.\*—

Both "British Goblins" and "Basque Legends" have the same object— to preserve a folk-lore which is fast disappearing. In Wales, mines and railways are killing out the old superstitions; and Board Schools will soon give them the *coup de grace*. In Basque-land the legend loving folk is dying off; the last Carlist War must have decimated the Spanish Basques, and the emigration to Buenos Ayres and Mexico is a constant drain on a population of some three-quarters of a million.

The Basques are interesting because they arve non-Aryans— i.e., their language has no affinity whatever with Sanscrit, Lithuanian, Old Gothic, or any of the Indo-Germanic tongues. Hindoos, Parsees, Germans, Greeks, Latins, Slaves are brothers, or, at least, first cousins in speech, and therefore we are told (though the assumption is a large one) in blood. After much delay the Celts have been admitted into this fellowship; nay, Mr. Huxley will have it that Celt and Saxon were the same people not so very long ago. But Escuara or Basque speech can by no ingenuity be brought into affinity with any of those above-named. It is something like the Finnish (which is kin to the Magyar); it is in structure yes more like the North American languages. If we divide languages, therefore, into monosyllabic or isolating, like the Chinese, in which the relations between words are only expressed conventionally; agglutinative, in which the relations are expressed by roots once significative but now reduced to a secondary office; and inflectional, in which the change in relations is expressed by a modification in the root itself, and even in the radical vowel, the Basque will belong to the second group, while all Aryan languages belong to the third. Their language is the most distinctive thing about them, for the Basque type in the Pyrences is not strongly different from Gascon or Navarrese. They are handsome people, not in the least prognathous, with rather small heads. Mr. Huxley, indeed, once applied the name to the "little dark race," of which remnants are found in Cornwall, in Kerry, and generally along the West of Ireland, and in parts of South Wales and the Highlands, but we think Mr. Boyd Dawkins holds that these were rather of the Eskimo type. Humboldt believed that probably the liguarians, and certainly one of the nations inhabiting Sicily, when the Greeks first began to colonise it, were Basques; and from this Mr. Webster argues that probably the story of Polyphemus is of Basque origin. The Tartaro, a one-eyed giant, who occurs in a good many Basque tales, has certainly some points in common with the unfortunate Cyclops.

If this is so, it is the only imstance of originality which the book before us furnishes. Every other legend is borrowed, with more or fewer variations. Some are quite modern French stories. The pastorales, of which a sample is given, are the ordinary miracle-play slightly altered. In Campbell's West Highland Tales, in Countess D'Aulnoy's Fairy tales, in Grimms and Dasent, we find the stories of which these are variants. The religious tales are a little more original; but, on the whole, it would seem as if Christianity in Basque-land, in killing out the old religion, had wholly killed out the old legends. Thus, though *Goicon* is the moon, and *Jaungoicon* (Lord-moon) is God, there is nothing to prove that moon worship existed among them, save a passage of Strabo, which refers to the Keltiberians. Were the Iberians, then, Basques? The question is interesting, but, like many interesting questions, nobody can answer it. Some have talked grandly of the Basques as the last remnant of the preriul population, a relic of times when Western Europe was peopled with the same race as that which is now dying out in America, when the island-continent of Atlantis (of which the Canaries, with their Basque-gaunches was a fragment) still linked the Old and New Worlds. All that is known is that the Basques still speak a tongue of the same grammatical form as that of the Red Men, and that their legends are singularly wanting in originality.

Of Wales it cannot be said that Christianity killed out the old legends. Many of these are unmistakenly Pagan in origin. Some Welsh antiquaries of a very realistic turn have striven to connect the fairies with the Irish (Scotic) invaders who swept the coasts from the dawn of history till the time of the Danes. According to them, parties of Irish were "left in various districts, and, fearing to show themselves, they lived in caves and sent out their children at night, fantastically dressed, to get food and exercise," and from the glimpses people got of them the fairy stories were elaborated. A more prosaic manner of accounting for a popular myth it is hard to imagine. Fairies, it is certain, existed in old Celtie mythology. St. Patrick found them in Ireland under the name of *sighe* (*shee*, seen in Banshee, the white fairy). Christianity did little to alter their status; for in the pre-Christian legends all about them is as delusive and unsubstantial as in the more modern descriptions.

Mr. Sikes has gathered a vast store of legends, tales, ghost stories, old customs; and the evident zest with which he has done his work shows that the Americans are not insensible to the charm of what is essentially an Old World literature. It is, at any rate, wholesomer work to be carefully gathering and sifting legends round Caerphilly or Pontypridd than to, be taking a part in one of those spiritualist *séances* for which America has a somewhat unenviable reputation.

Mr. Sikes believes that Shakespeare was indebted to Welsh fairy lore for his Puck. His friend Richard, son of Sir John Price, of Brecon Priory, must have known all about this fantastic sprite, for Cwm Pwca (Puck's coomb, or valley) is not far from Brecon, and was Puck's chosen haunt till Messrs. Frere and Powell's iron works were set up there. Mab, again, is an old British word, meaning young(*map*, in Gaelic *mac*); thus *mabgath* is Welsh for kitten, and *mabyer* Cornish for pullet.

One of the strangest things in Mr. Sikes's book is the high character of those who are favoured with fairy visits. They are "experienced Christians,"  "people of undoubted veracity," men like "the Prophet Jones," noted in Monmouthshire during the first years of this century for his fervent piety, and like Jones's schoolmaster, the Rev. Howel Prosser, "a right honest man," who once met a goblin funeral, and, touching the bier, saw the whole vanish, and found in his hand a horse's skull. Horses, by the way, and dogs share with true Christians the power of discerning spirits.

Much more modern than the fairy lore which, whether connected or not with "the victory of the sun-god over the night-fiend," is certainly pre-Christian, are the numerous devil legends. Besides the devil's bridge there is at Tintern the devil's pulpit, whence preached bad morals and worse divinity to the monks. A Cardiganshire tailor is even said to have measured him for a suit of clothes. Probably he overcharged; for, as usual in mediaeval stories, "the devil is an ass" in most Welsh legends. He can be defrauded of his undoubted due if the sinner is buried half in and half out of the Church, a plan of which there are several examples in England.

The custom of passing across the coffin the food given away at a funeral is connected by Mr. Sikes with the somewhat doubtful custom of the Sin-eater, a sort of human scapegoat, much discussed in the papers two years ago. Beyond all doubt is the belief in "cursing wells," such as St. Elian's, Denbighshire. If you can get your enemy under the influence of one of these wells he will pine away to your complete satisfaction. It is in scenery like the Welsh &that, if anywhere, legends may be expected to survive. Nor has Wesleyanism hitherto waged war against them in the same way in which Mr. F. Campbell found that Presbyterianism had well-nigh destroyed the old Highland tales, except in remote Roman Catholic islands, like Burra. Nay, Wesleyanism is so tender of superstitions that Mr. Baring Gould thinks it is Druidism come to life again. There are plenty of stories in Wales, and plenty of believers. Mr. Lukis, for instance, said at a recent Cambrian archaeological meeting that wherever there is a cromlech or a stone circle there is sure to be a legend. Yet how few, even of those who go to seek for such legends can find them? Like M. de Villewmarqué's Bretons, the Celt is very shy of talking about these things. "Even dwellers in the land," says Mr. Sikes, "often miss these stories, because they don't sink enough to the level of common life." The United States Consul deserves great credit for the patience with which he has gone to work. He evidently worked *con amore*; though he tells us "these tales are even more enchanting in the crucible of science than as tales," still the collection that he has given us is one of the most delightful books of the season.

"SIN-EATERS."

At funerals in some parts of Wales there is a curious custom. A poor person is hired to perform the duties of sin-eater. Bread and beer are passed to the man over the corpse, or laid on it; these he consumes, and by the process he is supposed to take on him all the sins of the deceased and free the person from walking after death. When a sin-eater is not employed, glasses of wine and funeral biscuits are given to each bearer across the coffin. The people believe that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, but that by drinking the wine the soul of the dead is released from the burden of the sin.

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE ECHO." The Sin-Eater in Wales,

Sir,—You print in Saturday's "Echo" a paragraph, entitled "Sin Eaters." I believe this to be a gross libel against the intelligence of the Welsh people. If the Welsh are living in Paganism such a practice might possibly exist but knowing by experience the high standard of life and religious practice of the Welsh in all parts of Wales, both in towns and in the remoter districts, I challenge in toto the assertion that at Welsh funerals any person ever acts the part if a sin eater as described in your paragraph. JOHN SAMUEL. Ealing.
