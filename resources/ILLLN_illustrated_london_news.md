Echoes of the Week

All those who are interested in popular legends, antique traditions, superstitions, nursery rhymes, old-fangled proverbs, and familiar locutions, quaint manners and customs, and, indeed, in all that goes the generic name of "folklore,"- will rejoice to hear that the originator of the term, the veteran Mr. J. W. Thoms, whilom Editor of *Notes and Queries* and librarian of the House of Lords, is busy organising a "Folk-Lore Society," the head-quarters of which are to be in London, and the subscription to which is to be a pound a year. I would rather that the subscription were guinea. The extra shilling is not missed; "little fishes eat sweet;" and what says the old song ?— "I'd rather have guinea than one-pound note." The object of the Folk-Lore Society (of which I am glad to see that ladies as well as gentlemen are to be eligible members) will be to collect, store-up, and publish accounts of all manner of curious, out-of-the-way oldwives erudition. Mr. G. Laurence Gomme is to be Honorary Secretary of the Society, which I shall hasten to join— if they will receive me. I have that within me which passeth show in the matter of folk lore; and I burn to unburden myself. I want to prove my favourite theories that Old Daddy Longlegs was Lollard or Wykliffite parson who declined to read the liturgy in Latin; that Jack Sprat and his wife-were Empson and Dudley; and I have some surprising developments to make public concerning Dickens's dishes and Meg's Diversion. Who knows but that before the Folk-Lore Society is year old we may arrive at a knowledge of the real meaning of the proverb with which Queen Elizabeth posed the pedant who boasted that he had made a collection, in one volume, of all the proverbs in the world. "Nay, but," quoth her Highness, when she had read the book, "'Bate me an ace,' quoth Bolton." Who was Bolton; and why did he want an ace abated ?
