On Palm Sunday, the custom prevailed, as elsewhere, of bearing green withes, instead of palms, in commemoration of our Lord's entry into Jerusalem. The day is also celebrated in a curious manner at Hentland Church. " The churchwardens present to the clergyman and to each of the congregation a small cake, which is eaten within the church, as evidence of a desire to lay aside all enmities, and to prepare for the Easter festival. It would be interesting to trace the connection, if any, between this custom and the ancient practice of sin-eating. Formerly a cup of beer accompanied each cake, but this part of the ceremony has now been abandoned." This custom was observed also at Sellack as late as 1867.

The practice of " sin-eating " referred to, being peculiar to the Welsh border, was discontinued before the end of the seventeenth century. The following description of it, given in Brand's *Antiquities*, is taken from the Lansdowne manuscripts : —

In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funeralls to hire poor people who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal), I remem- ber, that in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that when a corpse was brought out and laid on the biere, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer, which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money. In consideration whereof, he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after death. This custom alludes, methinks, to something of the Scapegoat in the Levitical Law, and though rarely used in our days, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government... The like was done in the city of Hereford in those times where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowl for the sinne eater.

Another account says that the sin-eater " pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

Dr. Schuyler, in his book on Turkestan, describes a corresponding custom : — " In Ach Kurgan ... he met an old man called an *iskáchi*, who made his living by taking upon himself the sins of the dead and devoting his life to prayer for their souls."
