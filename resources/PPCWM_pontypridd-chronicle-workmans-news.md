CHURCH FOLK LORE.

Writing in the *Newbury House Magazine* anent "Church Folk Lore," the Rev. J. E. Vaux records a very remarkable custom which prevailed up to, say, a couple of hundred years ago. There was in one of the villages adjoining Wales an old man who was called "The Sin Eater." His office was, for a trifling consideration, to pawn (so to speak) his own soul for the ease and rest of a soul departed. When a person died, notice was given to him, and he at once went to the house of the deceased. A cricket— i.e., a stool— was brought, and he sat down in front of the door. A groat, a crust of bread, and a full bowl of ale were given to him, after the consumption of which he rose and pronounced the "ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul." It was believed that this ceremony would free the departed soul from "walking" thenceforth. It is probable that this strange custom was originally connected some way with the ceremony of the Scape Goat under the Law (Lev. xvi. 21). This institution of the "Sin Eater" was in later times mainly confined to the county of Hereford; but there is reason to believe that it once prevailed generally in Wales.
