dole. — The giving of a dole, and the inviting of the poor on this occasion, are synonymous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration ou Satyrus, cited by Durandus. Speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says: — "The poor also shed their tears; precious and fruitful tears, that washed away the sins of the deceased. They let fall Hoods of redeeming tears." From such passages as the above in the first Christian writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead. "Preterea convocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacerdotes et Religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." *Durandus*. Had Pope an eye to this in ordering by will poor men to support his pall? Doles were used at funerals, as we earn from St, Chrysostom, to procure rest to the soul of the deceased, that he might find his judge propitious. Homilia in Matthei cap. 9.

In "Dives and Pauper," 1493, we read: "*Dives*. What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyté have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoven to the pore folke blynde and lame." — *Pauper*. Comonly in such prive buriynges bene ful smalle doles and lytel almes yoven, and in solemne buriynges been grete doles and moche almesse yoven, for moche pore people come thanne to seke almesse. But whanne it is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and fewe come to axe almesse! for they wote nat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that summe fals executoures that wolde kepe all to themself biganne firste this errour and this foyle, that wolden make themself richo with ded mennys goodes, and nat dele to the pore after dedes wylle, as nowe all false executoures use bv custome." By the will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury (1397), he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his body at the Conventual Church of Bustleham [Bustleton] in which it was to be deposited." Warner's *Hampshire*, 11, 73. Strutt tells us that Sir Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of Henry IV. died at his Manor in Norfolk, and his dead body was brought in a litter to London with great pomp, and much torch-light, and it was buried in the White Friars Church, "where was done for him a solemn obsequie, with a great feaste and lyberal dole to the poore." This custom, says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners, was universally practised all over the kingdom, as well as giving alms to the poor, in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased. *Manners and Customs*, ii., 109. Nichols, speaking of Stathorn in Framland Hundred, says: "In 1790, there were 432 in- habitants; the number taken by the last person who carried about bread, which was given for dole at a, funeral; a custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse. The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by will; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was seldom omitted. On such occasions a small loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and, not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect." *Leicestershire*, vol. ii., part i., p. 357. Lysons's *Env*., iii., 341. Pennant says:— "Offerings at funerals are kept up here (Whiteford), and I believe, in all the Welsh Churches." Hist, of Whiteford, p. 99. The same writer observes: "In North Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of little rolls of bread) which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, layd upon the bier and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter, or cousin (never done by a man), gives over the corps to one of the poorest neighbours three 2d. or four 3d. white loaves of bread, or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister, if present, says the Lord's Prayer, and then they set forward for church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor body, are brought upon a large dish, over the corpse, and the poor body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his friend and neighbour deceased." Compare *Sin-Eater* and Ditchfield, chap. 18. In the 18th century, it appears that at Glasgow large donations at funerals were made to the poor, "which are never less than £5, and never exceeded ten guineas, in which case the bells of the city are tolled." *Stat. Ace. of Scotland*, v. 523. It was formerly customary for a sum of money to be given to certain persons or institutions, with whom or which the deceased had been connected. This usage is illustrated by a document inserted among the "Egerton Papers," being the memoranda relating to the will of one of the Rokeby family, who died in 16OO. Among the items are gifts of sums of money to the principals of Lincoln's Inn, Furnival's Inn, and Thavis' Inn, for drink to be supplied to the members of those societies in honour of the occasion. This custom of funeral libations is still not uncommon in the country. By his will made in1639, Francis Pyuner, of Bury St. Edmunds, directed that out of certain rents and revenues accruing from his propertv, from and after the Michaelmas following his decease, forty poor parishioners of St. Mary's, Bury, should, on coming to the church, be entitled to a twopenny wheaten loaf on the last Friday in every month throughout the year, for ever. See a curious account of doles in Ducarel's *Tour through Normandy*.

Sin Eaters.— "Within the memory of our fathers," remarks Bagford, "in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire, (for so they called him, who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drunk off at a draught. After this, he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq. who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill the bookseller. How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient heathens?" Leland's *Collect.* lxxxvi.

"In the county of Hereford," says Aubrey, "was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them, (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal,) I remember lived in a cottage on Ros.se high-way. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corps, as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer, (which he was to drink up,) and sixpence in money: in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scape-goat in the old lawe, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22, 'And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the Wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited: and he shall let the goat goe into the Wilderness.'

"This custome, (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder; (*volens nolens* the parson of the parish,) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed, according to her will: and, also, the like was done at the City of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie: as also in Brecon." "At Llanggors where Mr. Gwyn the Minister about 1040 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom. I believe
it was heretofore used all over Wales." In another page Aubrey says: "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales:" where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer.

Bishop Kennet in whose possession Aubrey's MS. appears to have been, has added this note: "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, (Ambrosden) in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corpse one cake and one flaggon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church porch."
