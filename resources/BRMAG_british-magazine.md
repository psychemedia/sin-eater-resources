ANCIENT USAGES AND CUSTOMS IN NORTH WALES.

(From a MS, book of a Bp. of St. Asaph, written about a century ago.)

In the church there is a general spitting; they usually spit at the name of the devil or any of his synonyms, and smite their breasts at the name of Judas. In their ordinary conversation *that* name gives them no salivation, but is too familiar in their mouths.

If there be a fynnon vair (well of our lady or other saint in the parish) the water for baptism in the font is fetched thence. Old women are very fond of washing their eyes with the water after baptism.

At the delivery of the bread and wine at the sacrament, several, before they receive the bread or cup, though held out to them, will flourish a little with their thumb to their faces, something like making the figure of across. They (the women mostly), say their prayers on their first coming to church.

The Sunday after a marriage they come to church with their friends and relations with splendid appearance, disturbing the church, and striving who shall place the groom and bride in the most honourable seat. After church is over, with the fidlers before them, they run to all the ale-houses in the town.

When they bless another, they are very apt to add to the blessing of God, *the blessing of White Mary*.

The night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, each bringing with him some small present of meat, bread, or drink, (if the family be something poor,) but more especially candles, whatever the family is; and this night is called a *wyl nos*, whereby the country people seem to mean a *watching night*. Their going to such a house they say is *i wilio corph*, i.e., to watch the corpse; but *wylo* signifies to weep and lament, and so *wyl nos* may be a night of lamentation. While they stay together on these nights, they are either singing psalms or reading some part of scripture.

Whenever anybody comes into the room where a dead corpse lies, especially the *wyl nos*, and the day of its interment, the first thing he does he falls upon his knees by the corpse and saith the Lord's prayer.

Pence and halfpence, in lieu of little rolls of bread, (which heretofore generally and by some are still given on these occasions,) are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, and covered before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter, or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives cross over the corpse to one of the poorest neighbours two or three white loaves) of bread and a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor body that receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister (if present) saith the Lord’s prayer, and then they set forward towards church. And all along, from the house to the church-yard, at every cross way, the bier is laid down, and the Lord’s prayer renewed ; and so when they come first into the church-yard, and before any of the verses appointed in the service to be said.

In some places there is a custom of ringing a little bell before the corpse from the house to the church-yard. If it should happen. to rain while the corpse is carried to church, ’tis reckoned to bode well for the deceased, whose bier is wet with the dew of heaven. When a corpse is carried to church from any part of the town the bearers take care to carry it so that the cross may be on their right hand, nor will they bring the corpse to the church-yard any other way but through the south gate. There is also a custom of singing psalms on the way as the corpse is carried to church.

At church nothing is done but as directed by the rubric, besides that, evening service is read with the office of burial. At those words, “we commit this body to the ground,” the minister holds the spade and throws in the earth first.

The minister goes to the altar and there saith the Lord’s prayer, with one-of the prayers appointed to be read at the grave; after which, the congregation offer upon the altar, or on a little board for that purpose fixed to the rails of the altar, their benevolence to the officiating minister. A friend of the deceased is appointed to stand at the altar, observing who gives, and how much. When all] have given, he tells the money with the minister, and signifies the sum to the congregation, thanking them for all their good will.

The people kneel and say the Lord's prayer on the graves of their lately deceased friends for some Sundays after their interment, and this is done generally upon their first coming into the chureh, and after that they dress the grave with flowers.
