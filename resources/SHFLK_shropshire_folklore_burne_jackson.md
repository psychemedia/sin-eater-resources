DEATH.

...

This distribution of 'cakes and ale' at funerals is often alluded to in old writings.

'Deal on, deal on, ye merry men all,  
Deal on your cake and your wine ;  
Whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day  
Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine.'

*Fair Margaret and Sweet William*; PERCY, Reliques.

Anciently, the food and drink were 'dealt' not so much by way of a refreshment for the mourners, as of a gift to the poor to purchase their prayers for the departed soul. At other times the dole consisted of money, collected from all the attendants at the funeral, and afterwards bestowed upon the poor. This custom prevailed in Shropshire as late as 1723. In that year Sir John Wolryche of Dudmaston (Sheriff of Shropshire in 1716) was drowned in the Severn near his own house. The amount of the 'dole-money' collected at his burial was unusually large, and so grateful was it to his mother's feelings, as an expression of respect to her son's memory and sympathy with herself, that while she gave an equal sum to the poor, she preserved the actual coins given at the burial, laid upon the broad dish on which they had been offered, by her bedside to the day of her death, in 1765, forty-two years after the death of her son, and sixty-four after that of her husband. `[Blakeway, Sheriffs of Shropshire (1831), p. 170. Mr. Blakeway says these offerings were still customary in North Wales when he wrote, but they seem (see Brand, *Antiquities*, II. 208) to have there been made rather for the benefit of the parson than of the poor. No doubt they were once intended to purchase masses for the repose of the soul of the deceased.]`

One very curious and repulsive outgrowth from the custom of funeral doles must here be noticed, as by some it has been set down as a Shropshire practice. I mean the well-known account of the Sin-eater, taken from Aubrey's *Remains*, in which, let me point out, there is no reference made to Shropshire at all, I will quote the passage in full.

SINNE-EATERS.

'In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to (hire) have poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse high-way. (He was long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskel.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazer-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, whch he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (*ipso facto*) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scapegoate in ye old Lawe.  Leviticus, cap. xvi. verse 21. 22. ... This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was (observed) continued even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian government : as at Dynder, volcns nolens the Parson of ye Parish, the (kinred) relations of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Siune-eater ; and the like in other places in this Countie; as also in Brecon, e. g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient customme. I believe this customme was heretofore used over all Wales.

'See Juvenal Satyr. VI. (519 — 521), where he speakes of throwing purple thread into ye river to carry away ones sinne. In North Wales, the sinne eaters are frequently made use of ; but there, insted of a Bowle of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke. Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were continued at Grentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funeralls Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good Beer. — Cramer.' `[Aubrey, *Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme* (F. L. S.), p. 35.]`

The connection of this custom with Shropshire rests on the authority of John Bagford, whose letter on the subject is dated Feb. 1st, 1714 — 15. He says, 'Within the memory of our Fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of Bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of Ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this, he got up from the Cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, *the ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul*. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a Collection of curious Observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller.' `[Leland's *Collectanea*, ed. Hearne, p. lxxvi. QUoted in BRAND, *Antiquities*, II. 198.]`

It will be seen that Bagford is therefore but a second-hand authority, whose account was committed to writing some thirty years after Aubrey's own. It is singular, to say the least of it, that no other writer has ever even alluded to such a practice. `[But in 1852 Mr. Matthew Moggridge of Swansea asserted at the Cambrian Archaeological Society's Annual Meeting, that the custom had then been recently practised in the parish of Llandebie, Caermarthenshire. See Wirt Sikes, *British Goblins*, p. 826.]` Aubrey has always been noted for his romance and credulity, yet it seems hardly possible that he could have misunderstood a matter which he relates so circumstantially and apparently from personal knowledge. It is easier to believe that in some wild and remote places the custom of giving doles to the poor was kept up after the precise nature of the benefit to the soul of the dead man (expected in pre-Reformation days) had been forgotten, and that among ignorant people it was corrupted into the debasing superstition which Aubrey describes. But Salopians will be slow to believe that his story concerns their county until further evidence be forthcoming.

Much later than Aubrey's time, the funeral dole survived in North Wales in its more primitive and innocent form. Pennant in his *History of Whiteford* describes the nearest female relative of the dead giving bread, cheese, ale, and money to the poor over the coffin, and Mr. Wirt Sikes reproduces a curious 18th-century print of such a scene. `[Brand, Antiquities, II. 211 ; *British Goblins*, 323.]`

The funeral sponge-cakes of North Shropshire are still, or were recently, in use in Wales also`[*Ibid.*, p324]`. It is much to be wished that the subject of the ceremonial use of cakes could be farther investigated.`[E. g. we have Wedding, or, as it used to be called, Bride Cake, Christening Cake, Yule Cake, Twelfth Cake, Simnel Cakes, Soul Cakes, etc. : to say nothing of the divinations and magical remedies in which the baking of specially compounded cakes (as the Dumb Cake) plays a part.]` One cannot but suspect that the funeral cakes were in their first origin not a dole to purchase prayers, but a part of the ceremonial of the pagan burial-feasts; of which we really seem to retain other traces in Shropshire, to judge from the following passage in a letter addressed by the Rev. G. L. Wasey to Miss Jackson in 1873. He speaks of course of the neighbourhood of Bridgnorth.

VI. ALL SAINTS' AND ALL SOULS' DAYS. 

"Upon an ocean vast and dark  
The spirits of the dead embark  

All voyaging to unknown coasts.  
Wo wave our farewells from the shore,  
And they depart, and come no more,  
Or come as phantoms and as ghosts.  


" You shall attend me, when I call,  
To the ancestral banquet-hall.  
Unseen companions, guests of air.  
You cannot wait on, will be there."  
Longfellow, The Golden Legend.

"Earth knows not yet, the Dead has won  
That crown which was his aim.  

So day by day for him from earth ascends,  
As steam in summer even,  
The speechless intercession of his friends  
Towards the azure heaven."  
Newman, Lyra Apostolica, clxxvi.

It was a common practice of heathen nations to hold a yearly feast in honour of the dead. The Romans celebrated it in May, but other nations more appropriately fixed it at the beginning of the dark days of winter, when the falling leaves and dying year seem in themselves to suggest thoughts of death and momones of the past. Thus the Fathers of the Church did but consecrate an already familiar custom when they instituted the Christian festivals of All Saints' and All Souls' Days. The first hint of honour paid to the saints collectively occurs in the Western Church `[The festival had already even then been estahlished in the Eastern Church on the day on which it is still observed there, namely, the octave of Pentecost, our modem Trinity Sunday. ]` in the consecration of the Pantheon at Kome on the 12th May, 610, from being a temple of all the gods, to be a church dedicated to St. Mary and All Martyrs. In the first half of the eighth century Pope Gregory II. instituted the observance of All Saints' Day on the first of November, but it stood alone for more than a hundred years. It was not till a.d. 998 that Odilo, Abbot of Clugny, began to offer mass on the day after All Saints' for the souls of all the departed without exception ; and from this charitable practice of the monks of Clugny arose the festival of All Souls', still piously observed in Romanist countries. `[Alt, Das Kirchenjahr, p. 79.]`

Just as we should expect, we find that, beautifully as the ancient Feast of the Dead had been consecrated to Christian purposes, popular non-religious customs still cling around it, and on examination these all appear to hinge on the idea that at this time the spirits of the dead were abroad and revisited their former haunts. Thus, as every reader of Burns knows, 'Hallow e'en,' or the Eve of All Saints, was the best possible time for prying into futurity and learning those secrets which dwellers in the other world alone could reveal. The material feast of the day haply once consisted of food and drink set out for the use of the dead, but— after the manner of such offerings from the time of *Bel and the Dragon* onwards — presently consumed by the living. The bonfires still so religiously lighted in the Scottish Highlands and other places, were probably in the beginning charitably meant to give light and warmth to the poor shivering souls wandering in the cold dark night `[Compare for instance the following practices preserved by modern Christian nations. 'In Tyrol, the poor souls released from purgatory fire for the night may come and smear their burns with the melted fat of the "soul-light " on the hearth, or cakes are left for them on the table, and the room is kept warm for their comfort. Even in Paris the souls of the departed come to partake of the food of the living. In Brittany the crowd pours into the churchyard at evening, to kneel bareheaded at the gravoB of the dead kinsfolk, to fill the hollow of the tombstone with holy water, or to pour libations of milk upon it. All night the church bells clang, and sometimes a solemn procession of the clergy goes round to bless the graves. In no household that night is the cloth remoyed, for the supper must be left for the souls to come and take their part, nor must the fire be put out, where they will come to warm themselves. And at last, as the inmates retire to rest, there is heard at the door a doleful chant — it is the souls, who, borrowing the voices of the parish poor, have come to ask the prayers of the living.' Tylor, *Primitive Culture*, VoL II. p. 88. (See the whole passage, pp. 30-43, and compare Vol. I. p. 484, note, on savage customs of lighting fires for the use of ghosts. ) It will be seen that I follow authority in the statement made in the text : but inasmuch as bonfires and feasting were also customary at May, Midsummer, and Midwinter (the Yule-fire on the hearth), it seems to me that there is some ground for supposing the Feast of the Dead to have been engrafted, in pre-Christian times, on a more primitive November feast, held simply to celebrate the beginning of Winter, and corresponding to the May feast which celebrated the beginning of Summer. Old-fashioned folk, within my own knowledge, still reckon November, December, and January, as the three winter months : the ' winter quarter ' as the sexton's wife at Much Wenlock called them, speaking of the curfew, which is rung there from the 17th October (the old fair-day) to the 1st February. At Prees too the curfew begins six weeks before and ends six weeks after Christmas : t. e. from November to Candlemas. (*Byegones* for 1882, p. 149.) Country churchwardens do not allow fires to be lighted in the church before the 1st of November. Compare the account (Brand, *Antiquities*, I. 219) of the All Hallows' Eve ceremony at St. John's College, Oxford, in 1607, when a fire (evidently the first of the season) was lighted in the hall, and the whole company of students met together '*to beginne their Christmas*'. Anticipatory allusions to Christmas occur in several of our All Saints' Day ditties. By this reckoning Christmas is literally Midwinter, which season is supposed to end at Candlemas, when the Christmas decorations are taken down. Compare the dance ' round about our coal-fire,' anciently performed by the judges and benchers of the Inns of Court on Candlemas Day. The next three months form the spring quarter (compare Canting-quarter in Shropshire Word-Book), and on the 1st of May summer begins. Old custom accorded to outgoing farm-tenants whose tenure expired at Lady Day, the right of Boosey- pasture (see *Word-Book*) till the 1st of May ; i. e, the right to pasture cattle in the meadows, which at May Day must be 'drawn,' i.e, must have the cattle withdrawn from them for haymaking. (Nowadays farmers generally ' put up'  their meadows for hay at a much earlier date.) On May Day, too, the cattle began to ' lie out ' at night, and on the 1st of November they began to ' lie up ' again. Half-yearly payments were sometimes made on May 1st and November Ist : thus, the barber engaged to shave the old men in the Hospital at Clun (an almshouse founded in 1614) is directed to be paid on the feast of All Sainto and the feast of SS. Philip and Jacob respectively : entering on his duties no doubt on  the latter day like the servants, of whom we shall say more in chap. xxxi. `]

Of the first class of ' Hallantid ' `[Hallantid (Pulverbateh), Alhalontid (Worthen) ; see *Word-Book*,]` customs — viz. practising divinations on All Saints' Eve — I have met with but few examples in Shropshire. One, known to have been actually tried, has been already noticed (*ante* p. 176). Another method is, to stand before a looking-glass, combing your hair with one hand and eating an apple held in the other, when the face of the man you are to marry will be seen in the glass looking over your left shoulder. `[The West Shropshire maid who mentioned this to our informant said it should be practised on St, Thomas's Eve. (Mr. Henderson says— Northern Counties p. 326 — that in county Durham, St. Thomas's Eve is the special season for ghosts.) The latter, however— herself a Shropshire woman — assigned it, like Burns, to *All Saints*' Eve. The apples begged, as we shall see, for the feast, would naturally be used in the magic rites of the season. ]`

Traces of the material feast itself, however, survive in North Shropshire perhaps more fully than in any part of England, except, it may be, Cheshire and North-west Staffordshire. With us. All Saints' Day is known as ' Souling Day,' and up to the present time in many places, poor children, and sometimes men, go out ' souling : ' which means that they go round to the houses of all the more well-to-do people within reach, reciting a ' ditty ' peculiar to the day, and looking for a dole of cakes, broken victuals, ale, apples, or money. The two latter are now the usual rewards, but there are few old North Salopians who cannot remember when * soul-cakes ' were made at all  the farms and ' bettermost ' houses in readiness for the day, and were given to all who came for them. We are told of liberal housewives who would provide as many as a clothes-basket full.

```
[The following notices of the use of cakes at Hallowmas occur in Brand, Antiquities, Vol II. p. 219 *et seq*, The Irish peasantry used to feast on griddle-cakes at Allhallows, and the people of St Kilda in the Hebrides used to bake a large triangular cake on All Saints' Day, which must all be eaten the same night. At Ripon, All Saints' Eve is called Cake Night, and a cake is baked in each household for every member of the family. In Cleveland the bakers send their customers ' Saumas loaves ' (= soul-mass loaves), which are kept in the house for good luck. In Warwickshire, seed-cakes used to be eaten at Allhallows, and in Northants they were sent as presents and called ' soul-cakes.' In North Wales, in Pennant's time, the poor people to whom soul-cakes were given prayed God to bless the next crop of wheat. Tusser says ( *Works*, E. D. S., p. 223), 

'Whatever it cost thee, whatever thou geve,  
haue done sowing wheat before halowmas eve.'

And at the end of wheat-sowing, it was customary in the Eastern Counties to give the ploughman a feast of seed-cakes, pasties, and furmety (Ibid. p. 181). ]
```

It is remembered that the last person who kept up the old custom of giving soul-cakes at Pulverbatch was Mrs. Mary Ward (born Jaundrell), who died a centenarian in 1853. `[*Remains of Oentilisme and Judaisme* (ed. F. L. S. ), p. 23. ]` I am told that they were made and sold in the village of Welshampton up to 1870, or later. But the late Mrs. Gill of Hopton, near Hodnet, had soul-cakes made in her house to give away to the souling-children every year up to the time of her death in 1884. They were flat round (or sometimes oval) cakes — or rather 'buns,' a word seldom or never used by the Salopian peasantry — made of very light dough, spiced and sweetened. `[I append the ' receipt,' kindly given me by her family : ' 3lbs. Flour, 1/4lb. Butter (or 1/2b. if the cakes are to be extra rich), 1/2lb. Sugar, 2 spoonfuls of Yeast, 2 Eggs, Allspice to taste, and sufficient new milk to make it into a light paste. Put the mixture (without the sugar or spice) to rise before the fire for half an hour, then add the sugar, and allspice enough to flavour it well : make into rather flat buns, and bake.' ]` This is perhaps the last survival of a Shropshire custom which attracted the notice of observers so far back as the seventeenth century, when Aubrey wrote : ' In Salop, &c., die oium Animarum (All Soules'-day, Novemb. 2d), there is sett on the Board a high heap of Soule-cakes, lyeing one upon another like the picture of the Sew-Bread in the old Bibles. They are about the bignesse of 2d cakes, and n'ly all the visitants that day take one ; and there is an old Rhythm or saying, 

" A Soule-cake, a Soule-cake,  
Have mercy on all Christen soules for a soule-cake." `[]`

The ' rhythm ' has lost its religious form since Aubrey's time. 
I have obtained versions of souling ditties from the following places : 
Edgmond, Newport, Hodnet, Market Drayton, Ellesmere, Welshampton, Whittington, Oswestiy, tVestfelton, Kinnerley, Baschurch, Rodington, Pulverbatch, Berrington, and Wellington. `[The version quoted from *Notes and Queries* in Hazlitt's *Brand* (I. 220), comes, I feel sure, from Hordley. The curious will find my collection in the volume of *Shreds and Patches* for 1885. ]` They all vary more or less from each other, but on the whole the Market Drayton version seems the purest and oldest :

' Soul t soul a for a Soul-cake !  
I pray, good missis, a soul-cake !  
An apple or pear, a plnm or a cherry,  
Any good thing to make us merry.  
One for Peter, two for Paul,  
Three for Him `['The man,' Whittington and Oswestry; 'Them,' Staffordshire. 'The 
little lad under the wall,' Westfelton. ]` who made us all.  
Up with the kettle, and down with the pan, [`In Worcestershire (where begging for apples and beer was practised on St Katherine's Day, November 25th, and called Catherning) the line runs — 'Up with the ladder, and down with the can.' The ' ladder ' is to be raised to the apple-loft, and the ' can ' taken down to the cellar for beer. This explains our evidently corrupted version. ]`  
Give us good alms, and we'll be gone.'

For ' good alms ' most of the other versions read * an answer ' : `[A hontle ' (handful), Berrington: ' a big un,' Edgmond.]` for example, the WeLshampton version, which shows the point of the last couplet It runs : 

'Soul! a soul;  
An apple or pear or plum or cherry  
Is a very good thing to make us merry.  
I pray you, good missis, a soul-cake ! '

Here they pause, and if no notice is taken of them, they peep through the keyhole, crying out :

' Soul, soul ! a lump of coal !  
I am peeping through the key-hole !  
Up with the kettle and down with the pan,  
*Give us an answer*, and we'll be gone. '

Another distinct variant is the version now in use at Edgmond ; the one relating to the cakes, though still remembered, having been laid aside with the habit of making them. The italics show the way in which the rhyme is recited on two notes, F and E, the words in 
italics marking the lower note.

' Soul, *soul* ! for a apple or *two*.  
If yeVe got no *apples*, pears'll *do*.  
One for *Peter*, two for *Paul*,  
An' three for *Him*, as made us *all*,  
Up wi' the *kettle*, an' down wi' the *pan*.  
Give us a *big un*, and we'll be *gone*.'

And, like the Lark at Cock Robin's wedding, ' when ' they ' got unto the end, then ' they ' began again ; ' without an instant's pause, over and over untiringly and monotonously chanting their ditty, until some answer is received. Shakspeare must have had the sound of this lugubrious sing-song fresh in his ears when he made Speed reckon among the ' special marks ' of a man in love, that he had learnt ' to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas.' `[*The Gentlemen qf Verona*, Act II. Sc. I ]`

The other twelve versions of the souling rhymes which I have before me, vary between the two main types already given ... [examples are then given, but we might not with interest the following one:]

'I hope you'll prove kind with your ale and strong beer.  
And well come no more a-souling till this time next year.'
(*Market Drayton.*)

Much of the substance of these carols reappears in the Edgmond Men's Souling Song, taken down in November 1863, from the recitation of William Porter of Edgmond, then aged thirty-nine, who said that he and his fellow-labourers had 'remembered it and put it together' to sing at their master's door some ten or twelve years before. 'They maden it, they maden it the'rsels/ said his wife, anxious to magnify his talents. ' Naw, naw, it's a vera owd sung,' said the husband ; and so it evidently is, though ' re-edited,' in fact, by the joint skill of the party. The tune cannot now be recovered, ...

' There's two or three hearty lads standing hard by,  
We are come a-soulmg, good nature to try,  
We are come a-souling, as well doth appear.  
And all that we soul for is ale and strong beer. `[The Rev. W. T. Kenyon, Rector of Malpas, Cheshire, wrote to the Chester Courant on All Saints' Day, 1880, that he had just heard ' three middle-aged men with a concertina, singing a really sweet chaunt ' with words to the effect that 'all that they soul for is ale and strong beer.' ]`

' The streets they are gotten dark, dirty, and cold.  
We are come a-souling, this night we'll make bold,  
We are come a-souUng, as well doth appear.  
And all that we soul for is ale and strong beer.  

'Abroad in your meadows, alone in your streets,  
If this be a good house, we shall have some relief, `[I have been told by a middle-aged woman from Haughton, Staffordshire, on the authority of her mother, that souling parties were wont to go away shouting 'A good house,' or 'A bad house,' according to the treatment they had received. This explains the next verse also. ]`  
If this be a good house, as well doth appear.  
And all that we soul for is ale and strong beer.  

'Look out for your cellar-key, your cellar-key, good dame,  
By walking and talking you shall get a good name, `[That is, the fame of her liberality would be spread by her strolling visitors. This line occurs in the souling ditty used at Overton in Flintshire. See *Salopian Shreds and Patches*, 26th December, 1888. Other isolated lines of this song are inserted in the ditties used both there and at Oswestry. See *Byegone* of 11th December, 1872. ]`  
By walking and talking we've got very dry,  
So I hope my good missis will not its deny.  

' Go down into your cellar, and there you shall find  
Both ale, beer, and brandy, and tlie bast of all wine ;  
And when you are drawing, don't let your heart fail,  
But bring us one jug of your bonny `[This is the only instance in which / have ever heard the word *bonny* used in Shropshire. But see Shropshire *Word-Book*, s. v.]`] brown ale.  

' I pray, my good missis, don't tarry to spin.  
Look for a jug to draw some drink in.  
And when we have got it, then you shall see,  
And when we have drunk it, how merry we'll be !  

' Now Christmas is coming, it brings us good cheer,  
And when it is over, it's never the near ! ` 
Returning you thanks for your ale and strong beer,  
And we'll come no more a-souling till this time next year. '

```
'Near. . . Now used as a positive, but orig. the comparative of *nigh*.  (The form *nearer* is a double comparative.) M.E. *nerre*, adj., *ner*, adv., nigher ; AS. neár, comparative adv. from neáh, nigh.' Skeat, *Concise Etym. Dictionary*. 

`Though ye wolde gyve a thousande more  
Yet were ye *never the nere.*  
*A Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode.*

'Bounce, buckram, velvet's dear !  
Christmas comes but once a year,  
And when it comes it brings good cheer.  
But when it's gone it's *never the near.*'
*Mummers' Play, quoted in Brand's Antiquities I. 268, note 2.*

At Newport the children have introduced these lines into the souling ditty, corrupting the first (which of course alludes to the mock finery of the players) into, 

' A bouncing buck and a velvet chair ! ! ' 
```

The object for which the apples and ale were demanded was beyond doubt to make a ' wassail bowl ' of ' lambswool' or hot spiced ale with toast and roasted apples in it, such as the ' gossip's bowl,' in which Puck lurked ' in humble likeness of a roasted crab.' Accordingly, at Oswestry, the children (who have, as there might easily happen, imported a few words of Welsh into their ditty), sometimes begin it with the couplet,

' Wissal, wassal, bread and possal, 
Crw da, plâs yma.' `[*Crw day plâs yma* — good ale [in] this Place. Place = mansion ; cf. the 'New Place' at Stratford-on-Avon. This rhyme — given in full in *Byegones*, 11th December, 1872 — completes our list of variants of the Souling ditty. ]`

The dole of cakes and ale (the same gifts, be it observed, which were formerly bestowed at funerals) would furnish the poor with the materials for keeping the feast, in return for which they would of course be bound to pray at the All Souls' Day mass next morning for the souls of their benefactors' kindred in Purgatory. Like the funeral dole, the All Saints' Day alms would be bestowed to purchase prayers for the dead.

I do not know whether men be grown virtuous in these latter days, but certain it is that there are 'no more cakes and ale.' Even the begging for apples is very much on the decline. At Berrington it was completely gme in 1869. In 1872, Bishop How wrote that it had ' all but died out ' at Whittington, though it was in full force when he first went there in 1851. The stringent enforcement of attendance at school consequent on the passing of the Education Act of 1870, gave a severe check to it at Edgmond, and must have had somewhat the same effect in other places. Only the 'little idle rascals ' now, have leisure to observe the traditions of their fathers.
