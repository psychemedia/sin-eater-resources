BURIAL CUSTOMS IN WALES. TO THE EDITOR.

Sir ,—Is there among the numerous intelligent correspondents of the *Western Mail* one who can inform me to what extent the ancient burial and marriage customs of the Welsh still prevail? I allude particularly to the customs of watching over the dead in the manner called by the Irish "waking" – the placing of salt on the breast of the corpse, and the performance of the sin eater. I am told that these customs were still prevalent in Carmarthenshire, and other like neighbourhoods strongly Welsh, within a few years back. Do they still prevail ? A late number of the *Dublin University Magazine* represented the customs of this kind in Yorkshire as being only just extinct. No doubt your correspondents in Carmarthenshire could enlighten me as regards the same here; or the learned "Morien" might consent to devote a paragraph or two to the subject, which is full of interest to readers who have come to Wales from other parts. The bidding to weddings I believe is still practised in some sections, and the galloping to church may be also, but of this I have not heard. NEW COMER. Cardiff, Nov. 17.

THE RED DRAGON

In fulfilment of the promise we gave last week to notice at greater length the contents of the May number of the National Magazine of Wales...

... 

"The Sin Eater" is a capital little paper by Mr. Askew Roberts, Oswestry, in which the personage in question, much though he has been exercising the minds of English writers, is shown after all to be a myth.

AN EXTUAOUDINAUY OLD AVEL8II (SUPERSTITION.
In ono of the literary and art notes of tlie Bed Drttjion for March reference was made to an extra- ordinary old Welsh custom, said by the Hev. pax ton Hood in his book on "Christmas Evans," to bo observed even now in tho secluded Vale of Cwmaman, in Carmarthenshire. In the May issue of the magazine Mi.A?hcw Roberts, the editor of t))n?.M.<??j?n.f,?,tu,??p],??<} ?nt!- ,I"S an admirable paper on the subject, we take tho liberty of reproducing. it lii" 1 bsiua appropriately entitled, THK SIN hAn:II, According to Mr. Robert*, -6 There are twó articles of belief conneewd with Wales and Welsh- men that are firmly fixed in tho minds of English- men all the world ovor, One of these is, that there is a village in Anglesey called Llanfairpwllgwyn- gyllgogerychwyriidrobwlltyssiliogogogoch, and the other that there used to bo a disreputable old pruty eonneetèd with most parishes, whose busi- ness it was to swallow the offences of his defunct neighbours; and who, accordingly, bore the ominous title or tlie *Tho Sin Tho latent reference ] have seen to tho vil- lage with tho unpronounceable name is in tho 8uut/¿ Australian of Jan. 27, of this year; and the most recent • authority' for l?. superstition seems to be the Hey, Paxton tliood, who wrote a memoir of Christmas Evans a couple of year, g.. HUI, first of all, let us ,et what the earliest known 'authority on the ques- tion has to say about it. John AubrLy. who flou- :Iea: lIlli d3': h; to I'r;; all later historians' are indebted for their evidence of tho prevalence of the custom. Poor old Aubrey has been dubbed by no less an authority than Giffard, 'a credulous fool,' and, truly, aö annUler writer observes,'his power of discriminating truth from falsehood was by no mnans remarkable/ As the ibsumce of what Aubrey says, brand, in his •Popular Antiquílie,' quottlal :1n the county of Hereford was all old custome at Funeralls to hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes uf the Party deceased. On" ot them tire was a long, le,trie, ugly, lamentable poor raskelj I remember lived in a Cottage in Ross.* high-wave. The 1U'\I"'r was, that when the Corps was brought out of tho House, and layd ti?? Hiere, a Loafu of liread was brought out and de-1 livered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also 1Il\I,Iz,.r Howie uf Maph*, full of beer (which bee was tu dvinke up), and Sixe-pence in money: in whereof JUJ tooke upon him, ipso fit-to, ail the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This customo alludes, l!1"tlllnkri, s011Jdliing to the Scape-Uoato in tho olde Lawe.' Aubrey goes on to say Ihat though the custom was 'rarely 'N'd in (Jure dives, yet by *ome people ?,,s observed even in t bo 6trkteL time of tho Presbyterian It was also observed at 'Hreconand heretofore all over Wales.' He instances a ca>e at '(ita11nr, where Mr. Gwin, the Minister, ",)ut 1640, could n(Jt! hinder the performance of thisantient custome,'and further remarks: A.D. 108d. This custome is used to thi; daye in North Wales,' where milk, he sa>s, was tho substitute fnr beer.

I collected all the legends, and made notes of tiie old customs for the late Sir Thomas Philipps, If such a custom had prevailed, I should havo heard of it. I have no hesita- tion in writing that it is a glaring untruth.' The Hev. Roes Evans, vicar of tho parish, also wrote at some length, in reply to a letter from Mr. Silvan Evans.

I scruple to take up your space, 01' I II1Iht show that such II superstition is not eJisily r8rnovr-d from ol Iters which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of tho Leviti- cat MCape-gont. Groth" on I, Cor. iv., 13, traces one such in Cesar's account, of the Gauls (II, ix., 6). That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be I f(,n to say that they are either igncrant or superstitious. "In "U this the Jilaclettood writoro further4 authority '—for the editor of the Hand- hook could scarcely ho accounted one--lIn,1 Mr. Evans, in reply, OIJl!rvIl8 that Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plata and salt are necossary remnants of the alleged Sin Eating practice and, finding the. articles employed III certnln cases,they take it for granted that oj the more odious part of the custom has been rqiiioved," Aliicli amount* to begging the whole question.'

Welsh Morality
AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN ON WELSH "BUNDLING." TIIE "BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL" AND ITS CORRESPONDENTS. From tiuie to time astounding instances reach us of English ignorance with regard to Welsh national habits and customs. Not many months ago a note in the Red Dragon calling attention to a silly state- ment anent" The Sin Eat«r by the Rev. Vaxton Hood in his book on ChrbtmM Ev,Zl the means of eliciting from Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P„ an accomplished antiquarian, of 0«westry, a most able paper, in which tho wlinlo >i'\i Ii was so triumph- antly demolished that many a warm Welshman must hftvo felt tempted to apply to its promulgator the words ueed by (iiffard to another equally super- ficial observer, old John Aubrey. Perhaps it waa too much to expect strict accuracy on Welsh matters of a writer like Mr. Paxton Hood, who once de- scribed Llanidloes as the home of the realty !tUllt poet, John Dyer," and, mirabttt dictu spoke of Orongar Hill as 11 16 delicious spot in that neigh- bourhood." 
Mr. Hood, with the usual lightness of a professional bookmaker, appears to have hashed up the story of "The Sin Eater" from Murray's "Hundbook toSouth Wales," withouttroublinghim- self to alter much of the phr«seology, still less to inquire into the existence of tho revolting custom either now or at any time past. It bocomes our duty to call attention to an even worse ex:itnplo ot ignorance, because exhi- bited by a parson accustomed by his ordinary pursuits to greater accuracy, both of investigation and of thought, than a mero raconteur like Mr. Hood. In the Hrithh JItdiMl Journal of April 14 thia year appeared the third of the Uulstonian Lectures on "The Sterility of Women," delivered nt the <<>llo:je of Physioirms in February, 1883. by J. Matthews Dunc.n, M.D., LL.D., kc., I'hysii'i.n'-Aocouchuur and Lecturer on Midwifery al Si. Jtiithcl.jiujvv'ji fju.sj>ir.al.

These directly lead up to a statement that religion, morals, and law continue to inter- dict the cure that might result" from the ad iptiou of a natural method indicated by the lecturer.

THE GIRALDUS TESTIMONIAL

On Wednesday afternoon a public meeting was held at the Town-hall, Cardiff, to consider measures for raising a testimonial to the well known writer "Giraldus" (Mr. John Rowlands).

... 


That; this meeting regrets to find that Mr. John Row- lands, better known as t.Giraldus,' has been-over-i taken by paralysis, thereby depriving him of tbs; means of earning a livelihood for himself and; family, and further acknowledges that his long andJ valuable services in the interest of Welsh historyj and literature entitle him to the sympathy and. help of his fellow countrymen." The Rev. GRIFFITE ROBSRTS seconded the1 motion. The Rev. M. P. WwTArs, in supporting it, re-; marked that the issue of this meeting would showi whether Welsh Churchmen were prepared to support and encourage talent and industry de-o voted to the adornment of periodicals issued underi the auspices of their Church,or whether writers who; had spent the best efforts of their lives in tho service of the Church should be allowed to pine mir poverty and distress in the winter of their daya. No sadder picture could he found in the literary history of any country than the lest days of "4 Brutus,' the great Welih wit and humourist. The, annals of Grub-street, gloomy as they were, had no more pathetic spectacle than that of "Brutau8s' dying in poverty, and -when the fiery spark of: his heaven-born genius was quenched for ever consigned in a pauper's coffin to a nameless gravefr It was his (the speaker's) conviction that the legacy of the grave had lain heavily on the Welsh press ever since, especially on the Weigh Church press. It was for those present to do all thej,, could to exorcise this spectre of a hideous past$ and he trusted that their action at this meeting4t would be pregnant with good results for the5 distant future. Let them do what they could to add peace and comfort to the declining days of "Giraldus" and perhaps they would succeed in waking into song the m mute inglorious Miltona" of the Welsh hills and valleys, and inspiring the future Kebles and Stanleys of the 'Welsh Church. In works of this kind Churchmen could learn a lesson from the Nonconformists, Tho respect shown last Saturday to ?? Gohobvdd'- should teach them to pay honour to "Giraldess. (lear, hear) Mr. JOHN Diec"s also spoke in support of the motion, and observed that " Giraldus " had a claim upion Welshmen of every denomination. Colonel H. H. DIAvir, said he first became ae- quainted with "Giraldus" in 1869, when a band of 48 American captains went to celebrate the Anniversary of Independence at Caerphilly Castle. IThey could find no one to tell them the story of the ancient fortress except " Giraldus," who was then a schoolmaster at Bedwas, and who came at their request and gave them the history of the Castle. He also brought two Welsh harpers with him, who played the " March of Caerphily." " Giraldus " had been his neighbour now for some years. "G iraldus" commenced his career as a writer when be was eighteen years old,, end since the death of"Brutus" lie had been the; principal contributor to Ti- rHal. Twenty-five or' thirty years ago he published his researches intoi the history of Wales in the Cardiff and Mcridliyr Geardian end the CariAYZYYmes. lie also contri-: buted historical sketches relating to Cardiganshire and Carmartheosbirs in the Aberystiotzh Obser-ver, the Wclshemna and the CaermrhtheJournal. Some of his historical notes were also printed in the Western Mfail, in Brytion, a quarterly published at Tremadoc, and edited by the famous Celtic linguist, Professor Silvan Evans; in Goeteuadyr Oesi published at Carnarvon, and in tie Onro. With reference to the last, he received complimentary letters from "1 Talhaiarn," the celebrated bard and scholar, from ties Rev. Morris Williams (C" Nican. der"), from " Cattwgan " and from the Ven. Arch- deacon Jones, of Bangor (a native of Cadoston< justa-Barry), author oithe critical n otes on " olob's 5 MSS. Hae also wrote for the " Genealogia," edited by Dr. Howard, F.S.t, and the principal of the Historical' Department of the United States offered to exchange his works on genealogy with "Giraldus." He also penned several interesting papers relating to the sin eaters in \Vales. Whila he was librarian and Welsh secretary to the latej Sir Thomas Phiilipps, of Middle Hill, ?? ?? a trustee of the British Museum, he made a touR through' Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, and Glamorganshire in search of historical informal tion, and transcribed for the printers the charters of Wales and the works of the ancient Welsh bardsi He also collected, but las not yet published, thU monumental inscriptions of Welsh families. Hi~ notes on the history of the counties of Glamorgan( Carmarthen, and Cardigan were published at the request of several eminent antiquaries, and met with a large sale. He prepared papers on the history of the Van Caerphilly and on thehistoryvofM sal% Gwem-y-Gleppa, which were read before the Car. diff Naturalists' Society, and published the history, and pedigrees of the families of Dolau Cothiq Abermarles, Llanfair Clydogan, Havod, Absrmaed, and Llanbadarnfawr, as well as a history of the last-named parish, for which a prize was divided between him and "Llyfnwy "' at the Llancarfan( Eisteddfod. ' Girnldus" also wrote I Notes' on l the history of Moninouthshire, the Bishops ofl Llandeff, the Mathew family, Lhandaff, the Welsh| Royalists, and the history of Cefn Mably. E1el also translated several works on Welsh history and traced the pedigrees of Judge Johnes, the Vaughans of Crosswood, the Earls of Lisvanej the Wilkins of Llantwit Major, the Morgan5 of Tredegar, the Powels of Nanteos,. the Pryces of Gogerddau, the Turbervills of Ewenny; the Matthews of Llandaff; Johd Inglis Jones of Dewi Ormond; and the Steadmans of Tetradffin. He also catalogued the LlandaA Library for the late Colonel Bennett, R.A. Among his numerous other works was a history of. the first day schoo's in Wales and a biograpby ol Rowlands of Llankeitho. He also wrote a goo4 deal about ancient welsh marriage and funeral customs and Welsh games. He was frequentl% consulted by tiee late Dr. Nicholas while thle lattel was engaged on his " History of the County and County Families of Wales" and tbe biographers of Wesley and Matthew Henry also appealed ta him for assistance. The late Dean of Bangor en< tertained a high opinion of " Giraldu Is ' wri tings' and always regretted that his earvices to the Wel Church were not better recognised. The CaAcavARe, in putting the motion to thK meeting, esaid that were it not for the circum4J scribed use of the Welsh language the works o0 I Giraldus " would be known everywhere. The proposition was carried unanimously.

Correspondence?
The interesting discussion which followed Captain Hinde's paper on cannibalism before the anthropological section of the British Association at Ipswich on Saturday brought to light one or two facts connected with Welsh social life which are entitled to a passing notice. Mr. Hartland, of Gloucester, referred in the course of his comments to an old custom which obtained in Wales in times gone by, and which was called "sin-eating." As late as 1851 traces of it still survived in the Swainsea Valley, and it would he worthwhile inquiring whether they have completely disappeared. The "sin-eater" was the individual who literally "took the cake" at the death of a neighbour, and in consumling it was supposed to "eat" the sins of the deceased. The custom was a relic of barbarism, and shows with whlat tenacity old beliefs and institutions hold on. The student of men and his ways must feel regret that so many ancient customs and usages have been relegated to oblivion, beyond any possibility of re-call. But it was hardly expected that they should have survived in a country like Wales, which has given itself over to the Sunday school and the Bible. It is a mistaken policy, however, to drive out ancient customs, for they form links between the present and the past, and relieve modern social life of much of the monotony which enters into its very texture.

Wales Day BY Day

...
Aubrey, writing about the middle c! ths seventeenth century, remarks that, "in the strictest time of Presbyterian government, one very singular oustom was prevalent in many parts of rural England and Wales: — "In Shropshire when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'siro' (for S4 they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, where soaic of the family furnished him with a cricket or stool, on which he sat down faoing ihe (iccr. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread, which he ate, and a bowl of ale, which he drank off at one draught. After this he got up I the cricket, and pronounced with a composed I gesture 'the peace and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul. A similar scene is also recorded at Ross, about 1640, when the local "sin- eater," long, lean, lamentable pool nwoal," came, "when the corpse was taken out of the home and laid upon a bier and received a loaf of bread, and a mazard I bowl of maple fuil of beer (which he was ta drink up), and tixpence in money, in con- sideration of which he took upon him, faoto,' a'l the sins of the defunct, and freed him or r from walking after they wort dCld. 1' is noticeable (remark* a wriis* :n the "Giobe") that the "sin-eater's" fes was 2d. dearer in Herefordshire than ia Shropshire, but it is not recorded whether I this arose from ti fact that people wew wickeder in the fmrntt than th* laWsr conntjt

Sidney Hartland's letter on this subject which appeared in OUr i"ue of September 25 last, "Gwynlardd Dyfcdd" 'w?°: "J regret that, owing to my having been in a weak state of health reoontly, I have been unable before to give Mr. Hartland the be f ore to g i vl, additional information which he re- quires in support of the statements adduced in my article on the sin-eater in Wales. It give* me much pleasure to find that Mr. Hart* land was greatly interested in my contribution to the NKutty literature on the sub'ject of the alleged prevalence in bygone daysof this sin- eating custom in the Prinoipality and on its borders. Students of Welsh antiquities may like to know that the works quoted from by me on the subject are as \inder:—Pr>. 52, 53, and 54 of anderinlCS and Excursions in South Wales: With the Scenery of the River Wye,' by Thomas Roscoe.

In these notes in Cymru Fu M the writers on this subiect in turn draw their in- formation from Favton Hood's Christmas Kvans, and from 'Blackwood* {November, 1875).

THE SIN-EATER IN WALRI A column of the Times" of Monday occupied with a letter from Mr E. Sidney Hartland. Highgarth, Gloucester, on the subject of "The Sin-eater in Wales." The letter is written in answer to another correspondent. N, W. Thomas, who denied the existenceof the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the "Academy" twenty years and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World" of Febuary, 1882. Mr. Hartland claims that neither of these denials can outweigh the positive statements he cites in the earlier portion of his letter.

Editorial Comments
Quite a serious controversy has been waged in our oolumus, as well as those of the "Times," on the subject of the "Sin-eater" in Wales. The function of this individual is alleged to have been to attend funerals and consllm the sins oJ the defunct with cakts, washed doirn with nut-brown ale. It is alleged that sin-eating took place as late as 1852 at the village of Llandebie, in Car- marthenshire. Tiie matter was investigated by Silvan Evans, the lexicograplier, as well as the latf "Giraldus" (who was resident there at the very time), and wtlio buth failed to discover any foundation for the story. Still, the evidence for the "Sin-eater'' is not thus wholly got rid of, and equally extraordinary superstitions are to be met with in England and in other countries, so that no stone can reasonably be thrown at the Celt even if he did indulge these barbarous exeroises, relics as they are of a dark and credulous age.

THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES

TO THE: EDITOR OF THE WESTERN MAIL.

Sir-
A natural interest in thle place of my a birth prmopts me to ask you to give the death-blow, once for all, to the absurd figment which I find re-produced in the "Western Mail" of this mornin-g viz., that. "the superstition of the 'sin-eater' lingered even till 1881 in the secluded Vale of Cwmamman, in Carmarthenshire." When the late Mr. Paxton Hood first gave currency to the report in his "Life of Christinmas Evans", I, as well as others, asked some of the oldest reesidents of the place, whose memory reached back over 70 years, as to the truth of it, and they had never heard of the custom, which was said to prevail in their midst up to 1881. The late Dr. Rees, of Swansea, also naturally concerned that such a barbarous custom should be said to be practised by his countrymen towards the end of the nineteenth century, made the same inquiries, with the same result. I am not claiming for the secluded place of my birth an undue degree of enlightenment in asking you to "scotch " if it be hopeless to destroy entirely, the absurd idea which would, place it on a level with the most heathenish vas villages of Central Africa. -I am, &c.

J. LL. THOMAS, Vicar of Aberpergwm.

The sin-eater controversy did not end w it disappeared from theee oolumns. The "Tim, the "Aoademv." and one of the Bir- minm papers opened their columns to the disoMewton. and now a volume has appeared, entailed, "Tlie Sim-Bater, and Other Stories,* by Miss Fiona Maoleod. of which a reviewer says "she (the authoress) has oaught in too SIIIOIU degree the spirit of the Celt, with its gloom and superstition, its fixity of purpose, it hardiness cwd nobility.

SMOKING IN CHURCH. AN OLD WELSH CUSTOM. Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to the "Times" from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing:—"Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him re-calls an old practioe viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The CommulIion table st Jodl in the aiele, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence. I have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten."

ALso appears as:

CORRESPONDENCE 

THE "SIN-EATER." 

TO THE EDITOR OF THE "WESTERN MAIL."

Sir,-

I am greatly interested to see that your contributor, "'Gwynfardd Dyfed," has quoted an account of the custom  of the "sin- eater" as witnessed not so very long ago in Cardiganshire. As my stateneent at the British Association, and, indeed, the possession by Wales of this curious and important relic of the past at any recent period (or at all, if I un understand him: rightly), has been challenged by a gentleman who writes in the "Times," "Gwynfardd Dyfed" will confer an obligation on me and on all students of Welsh antiquities if he will kindly give in your paper a reference to the work from which he quotes (including exact title, page, date, and place of publication), and also state his authority for the survival of the custom in Cwmamman to 1881, for it seems to me that this was denied in 1882 by the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World."

I am &c..
E. SIDNEY HARTLAND
Highgarth, Gloucester.
