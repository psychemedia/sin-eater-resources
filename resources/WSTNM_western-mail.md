BURIAL CUSTOMS IN WALES. TO THE EDITOR.

Sir ,—Is there among the numerous intelligent correspondents of the *Western Mail* one who can inform me to what extent the ancient burial and marriage customs of the Welsh still prevail? I allude particularly to the customs of watching over the dead in the manner called by the Irish "waking" – the placing of salt on the breast of the corpse, and the performance of the sin eater. I am told that these customs were still prevalent in Carmarthenshire, and other like neighbourhoods strongly Welsh, within a few years back. Do they still prevail ? A late number of the *Dublin University Magazine* represented the customs of this kind in Yorkshire as being only just extinct. No doubt your correspondents in Carmarthenshire could enlighten me as regards the same here; or the learned "Morien" might consent to devote a paragraph or two to the subject, which is full of interest to readers who have come to Wales from other parts. The bidding to weddings I believe is still practised in some sections, and the galloping to church may be also, but of this I have not heard. NEW COMER. Cardiff, Nov. 17.

AN EXTRAORDINARY OLD WELSH SUPERSTITION.

In one of the literary and art notes of the *Red Dragon* for March reference was made to an extraordinary old Welsh custom, said by the Rev. Paxton Hood in his book on "Christmas Evans," to bo observed even now in tho secluded Vale of Cwmaman, in Carmarthenshire. In the May issue of the magazine Mr. Askew Roberts, the editor of the *Oswestry Advertiser*, an accomplished antiquarian, has an admirable paper on the subject, we take tho liberty of reproducing. It has been appropriately entitled,

THE SIN EATER

According to Mr. Roberts, "There are two articles of belief connected with Wales and Welshmen that are firmly fixed in tho minds of Englishmen all the world over. One of these is, that there is a village in Anglesey called Llanfairpwllgwyn- gyllgogerychwyriidrobwlltyssiliogogogoch, and the other that there used to bo a disreputable old party conneeted with most parishes, whose business it was to swallow the offences of his defunct neighbours; and who, accordingly, bore the ominous title of 'Tho Sin Eater.' The latest reference I have seen to tho village with tho unpronounceable name is in tho  *South Australian Register* of Jan. 27, of this year; and the most recent 'authority' for the superstition seems to be the Rev. Paxton Hood, who wrote a memoir of Christmas Evans a couple of years ago. But, first of all, let us see what the earliest known 'authority' on the question has to say about it. John Aubrey. who flourished between 1626 and 1700, is the man to whom all later 'historians' are indebted for their evidence of the prevalence of the custom. Poor old Aubrey has been dubbed by no less an authority than Giffard, 'a credulous fool,' and, truly, as another writer observes,'his power of discriminating truth from falsehood was by no mnans remarkable.' As the substance of what Aubrey says, Brand, in his 'Popular Antiquities,' quotes:– 'In the county of Hereford was all old custome at Funeralls to hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes uf the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskel) I remember lived in a Cottage in Rosse high-wave. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the House, and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of beer (which he was to drinke up), and Sixe-pence in money: in considera'con whereof he tooke upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the olde Lawe.' Aubrey goes on to say that though the custom was 'rarely usedin oure dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government.' It was also observed at 'Brecon and heretofore all over Wales.' He instances a casa at 'Glangors, where Mr. Gwin, the Minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of thisantient custome,' and further remarks: 'A.D. 1686. This custome is used to this daye in North Wales,' where milk, he says, was the substitute for beer.

"Now this is positively all the evidence we have that such a custom ever prevailed in the Principality: for although John Bagford (1717) tells (in Leland's  *Coll. I*. lxxvi.) of 'an old sire,' who was furnished 'with Cricket, on which he sat; a Groat, which he put in his pocket a Crust of Bread, wnich he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught,' he does but copy Aubrey, upon whose text modern writers have founded homilies. Hone summarised most of the evidence in his 'Year Book.' The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his 'Health and Education,' refers to the custom all an illustration of the performances of the Orphic priests, to show that in all ages we are very much alike; and adds, 'Alas, poor human nature!' Dr. Downes wrote most graphically of the custom in his 'Moutnain Decameron'– laying the scene between Aberystwith and Machynlleth; and others 'too numerous to mention,' have given their versions of the practice, and specified the localities wherein it is observed;, but where these accounts analysed, we invariably discern the 'original sinner' to the the 'long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal' of the Ross highway.

"A very interesting discussion on this question took place in the *Academy* during the winter months of 1875-6, in consequence of an artivle in *Blackwood* on the 'Legends and Folk-Lore of Wales,' in which the writer referred to the horrible custom of sin-eating. This attracted the attention of the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, who wwroteivite as follows:— 'The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unkuown in the Principality.' This at once called forth replies, but no new facts were obtained; all that was written being but a repetition of Aubrey and his followers. As may be supposed, the *Blackwood* writer was amongst the correspondents, and he called Professor Evans's attention to the fact that at the Ludlow meeting of the Cambrian Arclueclogical Society, in 1852, 'Mr. Moggridge cited a case of the superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill country of Carmarthenshire,' and referred him to the  *Journal* of the Society for the report. In the meanwhile Mr. Evans spared no pain to collect evidence, and took up 'authorities,' and gave the result of his inquiries in the *Academy* of January 29, 1876. First of all he quotes a portion of what Mr. Moggridge was reported to have said, which was this:— 'In Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had moe early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandonded, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally) only the plate and salt.' It will be seen from the foregoing that no mention is made of 'within five years;' and on this fact Mr. Evans comments, but the matter was afterwards explained by the *Blackwood* writer in a further quotation from Mr. Moggridge, which, however, he and Mr. Evans read differently.

"In passing it will be interesting to note how old customs and legends get mixed up by modern historians. Not a word is said by Aubrey about salt; although the use of salt, in some form other, at funerals has not been disputed. But to return to Professor Evans's reply. In a private letter he received from Mr, Moggridge, that gentelman told him that he did 'not remember anything that gives a date,' adding that 'the only written account' of the Sin Eater, 'from personal knowledge, is that of Aubrey, "de Genti1isme."' And as Aubrey did not profess to speak from personal knowledge, Mr. Evans justly considered the matter as doubtful as ever. Llandebie itself was not unrepresented in the discussion. Mr. John Rowlands, the schoolmaster there, wrote to the following effect in the *Western Mail*:— 'I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish- its legends, customs, and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of a Sin Eater; in fact people there never gave cakes at funerals. I knew almost every parish in South Wales. I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Philipps. If such a custom had prevailed, I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth.' The Rev. Rees Evans, vicar of tho parish, also wrote at some length, in reply to a letter from Mr. Silvan Evans. In the course of his communication he says:–  'One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have appeared here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age.' The conclusion the clergyman comes to, after the inquiries he makes amongst his parishioners, is that 'the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority, or proved by any credible evidence.'

Mr. Evans's lengthy communication drew forth from the writer in *Blackwood* an equally lengthy reply; in the course of which he referred to himself as, 'by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales.' And he speaks of his frequent travels over the whole of the Principality; so he felt competent to offer an opinion, although he had failed to 'acquire the language.' Before this letter appeared I had joined in the discussion, and hinted that the author of the paper on the 'Legends and Folk-lore of Wales' was a resident of the Herefordshire border; and I now have no hesitation in saying that it was the late Prebendary Davies, of Moor Court, Kington, whose recent death all who are interested in Welsh literature and archaeology have to mourn. His reply to Mr. Evans appeared on February 8, and he quotes Murray's 'Handbook to South Wales' (edit. 1870), edited by 'a medical man of eminence' (as he believes), for the fact that 'the superstition of the Sin Eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman, in Caermarthenshore.' After which he goes on to say :— 'I refer to the Ordnance Maps, and find Cwm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandobie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway.' Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary*, refers to the same superstition, and, if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such inquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr, Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers, to practice on their credulity, and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space,, or I might show that such a supersition is not easily removed from others which, im many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius, in I, Cor. iv., 13, traces one such in Cesar's account, of the Gauls (B, ix., 6). That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious.

"In all this the *Blackwood* writer gives no further 'authority'— for the editor of the *Handbook* could scarcely be accounted one– and Mr. Evans, in reply, observes that 'Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessary remnants of the alleged Sin Eating practice; and, finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that "the more odious part of the custom has been removed," which amounts to begging the whole question.' He considers 'it is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to "refresh" his memory respecting the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat;"' and concludes by refusing to give credit to any statement on the authority of 'so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part.' Here the discussion ended as far as the principals were concerned. Another discussion was carried on in the 'Shreds and Patches' column of the *Shrewsbury Journal* a year or two later and on more than one occasion the superstition has been referred to in the 'Bye-Gones' column of the *Oswestry Advertiser*. Mr. Wirt Sykes goes very fully into the question in his 'British Goblins,' and comes to the conclusion that 'no other writer of Aubrey's time, either English or Welsh, appears to h*v« made any reference to the Sin Eater in Wales; and equal silence prevails throughout the writings of previous centuries.' And as to later 'authorities,' Mr. Sykes failed to discover one who wrote in the Welsh language, 'a singular omission if there ever was such a custom, for concerning every other superstitious practice commonly ascribed to Wales the Welsh have written freely.'

"And now, when we might reasonably have expected that the Sin Eater had been laid for ever, appears the Rev. Paxton Hood's book—referred to in the March number of the *Red Dragon*. Mr. Hood is a very pleasant writer, but he is too impulsive for an antiquary. It was only in 1876 that he gave a glowing picture of Llanidloes, 'the home of the really great poet, John Dyer,' and told us of 'Grongar Hill, a delicious spot in that neighbourhood!' Now he sets up an imaginary being in the district of Cwm-Amman; and only varies the words of Mr. Murray's editor by remarking that the superstition 'is said to linger even now,' instead of (as Murray has it), 'is said to have lingered until very recently,' in that happy valley! Mr. Hood's assertion was copied into *Notes aud Queries* in January last, and will, doubtless, be accepted as gospel by a goodly number; but, unfortunately for him, his book on Christmas Evans attracted the attention of a brother minister in the same Cwm-Amman Vale, who promptly wrote to the *Christian World* to repudiate the whole story."

Welsh Morality
AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN ON WELSH "BUNDLING."

THE "BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL" AND ITS CORRESPONDENTS.

From time to time astounding instances reach us of English ignorance with regard to Welsh national habits and customs. Not many months ago a note in the *Red Dragon* calling attention to a silly statement anent "The Sin Eater" by the Rev. Paxton Hood in his book on "Christmas Evans" the means of eliciting from Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P., an accomplished antiquarian, of Oswestry, a most able paper, in which the whole myth was so Giffard to another equally superficial observer, old John Aubrey. Perhaps it waa too much to expect strict accuracy on Welsh matters of a writer like Mr. Paxton Hood, who once described Llanidloes as the home of the *really great poet*, John Dyer," and, *mirabile dictu!* spoke of Grongar Hill as "a delicious spot in that neighbourhood." Mr. Hood, with the usual lightness of a professional bookmaker, appears to have hashed up the story of "The Sin Eater" from Murray's "Handbook to South Wales," without troubling himself to alter much of the phraseology, still less to inquire into the existence of tho revolting custom either now or at any time past.

It becomes our duty to call attention to an even worse example of ignorance, because exhibited by a parson accustomed by his ordinary pursuits to greater accuracy, both of investigation and of thought, than a mere raconteur like Mr. Hood. In the *British Medical Journal* of April 14 thia year appeared the third of the Gulstonian Lectures on "The Sterility of Women," delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in February, 1883, by J. Matthews Duncan, M.D., LL.D., &c., Phyysician-Accoucheur and Lecturer on Midwifery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of the heads of the lecture deals with the sterility alleged to be "dependent on some inscrutable incompatibility of the parties, as in Augustus and Livia, Napoleon and Josephine," after which follow certain observations which, however proper to a professional journal, would be decidedly out of place in one like our own. These directly lead up to a statement "that religion, morals, and law continue to interdict the cure that might result" from the adoption of a natural method indicated by the lecturer. And immediately afterwards comes the following assertion, infamous in its purport and astonishing in the information it conveys, which we have reluctantly felt compelled to reproduce in full: —

"Unfortunately, however, among large classes – chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland – custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatibility. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohibit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage tie is made. A woman an proving sterile mav be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."

Now, we do not wish to characterise this as a wicked invention from first to last, because we are perfectly well aware there have been some absurd notions about that respect to the Welsh custom of "bundling," which may have had some slight substratum of fact. But what we do say, and say most emphatically, is that the custom, whenever and wherever it might have prevailed, was not the infamous thing here described. If the facts were invvestigated we unhesitatingly assert that they would disclose no more harmful a state of affairs than is witnessed in every day courtship in English or Scotch life. Indeed, if the decision were left to us, we should say that, as compared with the blue-chian and stained-glass window attitudes of those languishing youths and maidens with whom MEssrs. Gilbert and Sullivan have made us acquainted, those adopted by the Bundlers (whom we admit, for the sake of our illustration, to exist) are much the more wholesome of the two. That such an infamous imputation against the morals of Welch parents and Wlesh children should have been uttered or printed without careful inquiry into the facts is almost inconceivable. That such an abominable accusation should have been allowed to pass unchallenged would have been less conceivable still. We were therefore pleased to find the cudgles taken up with some warmth on behalf of the Welsh people by Mr. E. Rice Morgan, Morriston, who, in a letter to the editor of the *British Medical Journal*, printed in its issue of May 5, says:-

WELSH MORALITY

Sir,—

On page 702 of your journal for the 14th instant, Dr. Matthews Duncan states this:—

"Unfortunately, however, among large classes — chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland – custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatibility. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohibit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage tie is made. A woman proving sterile may be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."

I know the habits of the Welsh well, and, thought they are far from what could be wished, there is no such practice as Dr. Duncan alludes to. To make such a statement and allow it to be printed is a gross moral blunder. I would suggest to Dr. Duncan to examone more closely into the morals of his own country. let him examine and compare the statistics of illegitimacy there and here. I should be glad to see them printed. —
Youres obediently, E. RICE MORGAN.

This communication attracted the notice of Dr. Dd. Thomas, Ystalyfera, who, thinking the charge made by Dr. matthews DUncan should not be allowed to remain without a further attempt at refutation, also wrote the editor a letter on the subject, but beyond an acknowledgement of its receipt no further notice was taken of it in the columns of the *British Medical Journal*. Through the courtesy of Dr. Thomas we are enabled to publish a copy of this letter. It is as follows:—

TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL."

SIR,– I am glad to find my friend, Mr. E. Rice Morgan, has entered his protest against the odious and unwarrantable statement made by Dr. Matthews Duncan as to welsh morality in his address on "Sterility" as published recently in your journal (*vide* page 702, April 14).

I have lived nearly all my life in Wales, and from what I know of the habits of the people I am glad of this opportunity to endorse every word that Mr. Morgan says.

Between the Judge-Advocate-General (who claims to rempresent in Parlimanet the opinion of the Wesh Primcipaility) saying theat "the Welsh people hated tests more than they hated Atheists" and Dr. Duncan's infamous accusation as to the existince of "bundling" in Wales, I fear our friends beyond Offa's Dyke will credit us with a less degree of civilisation than what they have hitherto done. True, nearly all the Welsh members voted for the Bradlaugh Relief Bill; but I am satisfied that many did so more the sake of following their leader than of representing the voice of their constituents. And I fear Dr. Duncan made his reckless statement more with the view of writing a sensational paper than of putting before the public a plain statement of facts.On reading over Dr. Duncan's address, and particulalry that part of it with reference to "bundling," I could not but be struck with the recollection of a little pamphlet which appeared in Edinburgh some twenty years or more ago, called "The Mysteries of the Temple," "By an Acoolyte." This production was supposed to be a take-off on the then practice of the late Sir James Simpson; but, as it was written with little or no regard for truth, it was suppressed after but a short existence. For my own part, and for the sake of the reputation of my countrymen and countrywomen, I would be glad to find a similar fate befall Dr. Duncan's address rather than it should be the means of disseminating broadcast such erroneous statements as it contains, and thereby branding a whole nation with gross immoraility.— I remain, sir, your obedient servant, DD. THOMAS, M.D. Ystalfera, 7th May.

This letter was not a wit too scathing in view of the aggravated character of the charge to which it was intended as a reply. That it was refuesed insertion may not impposibly be taken as only another instance of how very much more ready the owners of some English minds are to give currency to any scandalous rumour, no matter how flimsy and untrustworthy, concerning their Wlesh neighbours than to afford the latter a full and fiar opportunity of self-justification. Whataver the edotor of the *British Medical Journal* may have thought of Dr. Thomas's letter, we are quite sure that all Welsh people, and all right-minded English people as well, will feel thankful to the Doctor for having written it. The Duncans and ths Paxton Hoods of the country are people who must be taught that they cannot malign their neighbours, whenever it please them, with impunity.

THE GIRALDUS TESTIMONIAL

On Wednesday afternoon a public meeting was held at the Town-hall, Cardiff, to consider measures for raising a testimonial to the well known writer "Giraldus" (Mr. John Rowlands).

...

The Rev. Theophilus Rees then moved:– "That this meeting regrets to find that Mr. John Rowlands, better known as 'Giraldus,' has been overtaken by paralysis, thereby depriving him of the means of earning a livelihood for himself and family, and further acknowledges that his long and valuable services in the interest of Welsh history and literature entitle him to the sympathy and help of his fellow countrymen."

The Rev. GRIFFITH ROBERTS seconded the motion.

The Rev. M. P. WILLIAMS, in supporting it, remarked that the issue of this meeting would show whether Welsh Churchmen were prepared to support and encourage talent and industry devoted to the adornment of periodicals issued under the auspices of their Church, or whether writers who had spent the best efforts of their lives in tho service of the Church should be allowed to pine in poverty and distress in the winter of their days. No sadder picture could he found in the literary history of any country than the last days of "Brutus," the great Welsh wit and humourist. The, annals of Grub-street, gloomy as they were, had no more pathetic spectacle than that of "Brutus" dying in poverty, and when the fiery spark of his heaven-born genius was quenched for ever consigned in a pauper's coffin to a nameless grave. It was his (the speaker's) conviction that the legacy of the grave had lain heavily on the Welsh press ever since, especially on the Welsh Church press. It was for those present to do all they could to exorcise this spectre of a hideous past, and he trusted that their action at this meeting would be pregnant with good results for the5 distant future. Let them do what they could to add peace and comfort to the declining days of "Giraldus" and perhaps they would succeed in waking into song the "mute inglorious Miltons" of the Welsh hills and valleys, and inspiring the future Kebles and Stanleys of the Welsh Church. In works of this kind Churchmen could learn a lesson from the Nonconformists. Tho respect shown last Saturday to "Gohebydd" should teach them to pay honour to "Giraldus". (Hear, hear.)

Mr. JOHN DUNCAN also spoke in support of the motion, and observed that "Giraldus " had a claim upion Welshmen of every denomination.

Colonel H. H. DAVIES said he first became acquainted with "Giraldus" in 1869, when a band of 48 American captains went to celebrate the Anniversary of Independence at Caerphilly Castle. They could find no one to tell them the story of the ancient fortress except "Giraldus," who was then a schoolmaster at Bedwas, and who came at their request and gave them the history of the Castle. He also brought two Welsh harpers with him, who played the "March of Caerphily." "Giraldus" had been his neighbour now for some years. "Giraldus" commenced his career as a writer when be was eighteen years old, and since the death of "Brutus" he had been the principal contributor to  *Yr Haul*. Twenty-five or thirty years ago he published his researches into the history of Wales in the *Cardiff and Merthy Guardian* and the *Cardiff Times**. He also contributed historical sketches relating to Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshore in the *Aberystwith Observer*, the *Welshman* and the *Carmarthen Journal*. Some of his historical notes were also printed in the *Western Mail*, in *Brython*, a quarterly published at Tremadoc, and edited by the famous Celtic linguist, Professor Silvan Evans; in *Goleuad yr Oes* published at Carnarvon, and in the *Cymro*. With reference to the last, he received complimentary letters from "Talhaiarn," the celebrated bard and scholar, from the Rev. Morris Williams ("Nicander"), from " Cattwgan " and from the Ven. Archdeacon Jones, of Bangor (a native of Cadoxton- juxta-Barry), author of the critical notes on "Iolob's" MSS. He also wrote for the "Genealogia," edited by Dr. Howard, F.S.A, and the principal of the Historical Department of the United States offered to exchange his works on genealogy with "Giraldus." He also penned several interesting papers relating to the sin eaters in Wales. Whila he was librarian and Welsh secretary to the latej Sir Thomas Phiilipps, of Middle Hill,.R.S., a trustee of the British Museum, he made a tour through Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, and Glamorganshire in search of historical information, and transcribed for the printers the charters of Wales and the works of the ancient Welsh bards. He also collected, but has not yet published, the monumental inscriptions of Welsh families. His notes on the history of the counties of Glamorgan, Carmarthen, and Cardigan were published at the request of several eminent antiquaries, and met with a large sale. He prepared papers on the history of the Van Caerphilly and on the history of Maesaleg Gwem-y-Gleppa, which were read before the Cardiff Naturalists' Society, and published the history and pedigrees of the families of Dolau Cothi, Abermarles, Llanfair Clydogan, Havod, Absrmaed, and Llanbadarnfawr, as well as a history of the last-named parish, for which a prize was divided between him and "Llyfnwy " at the Llancarfan Eisteddfod. "Giraldus" also wrote "Notes" on the history of Monmouthshire, the Bishops of Llandaff, the Mathew family, Llandaff, the Welsh Royalists, and the history of Cefn Mably. He also translated several works on Welsh history and traced the pedigrees of Judge Johnes, the Vaughans of Crosswood, the Earls of Lisvane, the Wilkins of Llantwit Major, the Morgans of Tredegar, the Powels of Nanteos, the Pryces of Gogerddau, the Turbervills of Ewenny; the Matthews of Llandaff; John Inglis Jones of Dewi Ormond; and the Steadmans of Ystradffin. He also catalogued the Llandaff Library for the late Colonel Bennett, R.A. Among his numerous other works was a history of the first day schools in Wales and a biograpby of Rowlands of Llangeitho. He also wrote a good deal about ancient welsh marriage and funeral customs and Welsh games. He was frequently consulted by the late Dr. Nicholas while thle lattel was engaged on his " History of the County and County Families of Wales" and the biographers of Wesley and Matthew Henry also appealed to him for assistance. The late Dean of Bangor entertained a high opinion of "Giraldus's" writings, and always regretted that his services to the Welsh Church were not better recognised.

The CHAIRMAN, in putting the motion to the meeting, said that were it not for the circumscribed use of the Welsh language the works of "Giraldus " would be known everywhere.

The proposition was carried unanimously.

On the proposition of Mr. D. TUDOR EVANS, seconded by Colonel Davies, it was resolved that the gentlemen present, with power to add to their number, should be appointed a commmittee for the purpose of collecting subscriptions towards securing for "Giraldus" an annunity for the remainder of his life. The meeting then resolved itself into committee, and having appointed the Rev. G. A. Jones chairman, proceeded to consider what steps should be taken to raise the funds.

The interesting discussion which followed Captain Hinde's paper on cannibalism before the anthropological section of the British Association at Ipswich on Saturday brought to light one or two facts connected with Welsh social life which are entitled to a passing notice. Mr. Hartland, of Gloucester, referred in the course of his comments to an old custom which obtained in Wales in times gone by, and which was called "sin-eating." As late as 1851 traces of it still survived in the Swainsea Valley, and it would he worthwhile inquiring whether they have completely disappeared. The "sin-eater" was the individual who literally "took the cake" at the death of a neighbour, and in consumling it was supposed to "eat" the sins of the deceased. The custom was a relic of barbarism, and shows with whlat tenacity old beliefs and institutions hold on. The student of men and his ways must feel regret that so many ancient customs and usages have been relegated to oblivion, beyond any possibility of re-call. But it was hardly expected that they should have survived in a country like Wales, which has given itself over to the Sunday school and the Bible. It is a mistaken policy, however, to drive out ancient customs, for they form links between the present and the past, and relieve modern social life of much of the monotony which enters into its very texture.

Wales Day By Day

...

Aubrey, writing about the middle of ths seventeenth century, remarks that, "in the strictest time of Presbyterian government, one very singular custom was prevalent in many parts of rural England and Wales: — "In Shropshire... when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, where some of the family furnished him with a cricket or stool, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket, a crust of bread, which he ate, and a bowl of ale, which he drank off at one draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced with a composed gesture "the peace and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul". A similar scene is also recorded at Ross, about 1640, when the local "sin-eater," "a long, lean, lamentable poor rascal," came, "when the corpse was taken out of the house and laid upon a bier ... and received a loaf of bread, and a mazard bowl of maple fuil of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money, in consideration of which he took upon him, 'ipso facto,' all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they woere dead." It is noticeable (remarks a writer in the "Globe") that the "sin-eater's" fee was 2d. dearer in Herefordshire than in Shropshire, but it is not recorded whether this arose from the fact that people were wickeder in the former than the latter county.

SMOKING IN CHURCH. AN OLD WELSH CUSTOM.

Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to the "Times" from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing:— "Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him re-calls an old practioe viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The Communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence. I have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten."

ALso appears as:

CORRESPONDENCE 

THE "SIN-EATER." 

TO THE EDITOR OF THE "WESTERN MAIL."

Sir,-

I am greatly interested to see that your contributor, "Gwynfardd Dyfed," has quoted an account of the custom  of the "sin-eater" as witnessed not so very long ago in Cardiganshire. As my stateneent at the British Association, and, indeed, the possession by Wales of this curious and important relic of the past at any recent period (or at all, if I un understand him: rightly), has been challenged by a gentleman who writes in the "Times," "Gwynfardd Dyfed" will confer an obligation on me and on all students of Welsh antiquities if he will kindly give in your paper a reference to the work from which he quotes (including exact title, page, date, and place of publication), and also state his authority for the survival of the custom in Cwmamman to 1881, for it seems to me that this was denied in 1882 by the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World."

I am &c..
E. SIDNEY HARTLAND
Highgarth, Gloucester.

THE SIN-EATER.

LETTER FROM "GWYNFARDD DYFED."

In reply to Mr. E. Sidney Hartland's letter on this subject which appeared in our issue of September 25 last, "Gwynfardd Dyfedd" writes:– "I regret that, owing to my having been in a weak state of health recently, I have been unable before to give Mr. Hartland the additional information which he requires in support of the statements adduced in my article on the sin-eater in Wales. It gives me much pleasure to find that Mr. Hartland was greatly interested in my contribution to the scanty literature on the subject of the alleged prevalence in bygone days of this sin-eating custom in the Principality and on its borders. Students of Welsh antiquities may like to know that the works quoted from by me on the subject are as under:— Pp. 52, 53, and 54 of 'Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales: With the Scenery of the River Wye,' by Thomas Roscoe, Esquire, published in 1854 by Mr. Henry G. Bohn. York-street, Covent Garden;, also pp. 92 and 166 of Part II, of 'Cymru Fu -Notes and Queries Relating to the Past Historv of Wales and Border Counties,' published in 1888 by Messrs. Daniel Owen and Co. (Limited), of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In these notes in "Cymru Fu" the writers on this subiect in turn draw their information from Paxton Hood's Christmas Evans, and from 'Blackwood' (November, 1875). By consulting those sources as well, Mr. Hartland may come across more matter relating to this curious and superstitious custom, now obsolete. Possibly, do thorough investigation of the matter would result in much more about it being brought to light. If a few of the oldest people in the neighbourhood of Cwmamman, in Glamorganshire, were interviewed, surely some folk-lore respecting the sin-eater might be obtained. I have talked to several old Pembrokeshire folk about the practice, but they appear to know nothing of such a custom; they, however, tell me that the plate of salt is still used in a great many eases. This, too, has come within my own personal experience. It is a pewter plate that is mostly used, if one such can be got. One old lady, now deceased, used to keep a pewter plate which she was in the habit of lending out for the purpose. It was also customary in the same county to place coins upon the eyelids of oorpses to keep their eyes closed. Are the coins and the plate of salt all mere relies of the sin-eating custtom, or does their use possess any real efficacy? This important question is one which the medical man could assist the antiquary by answering."

THE SIN-EATER IN WALRI A column of the "Times" of Monday occupied with a letter from Mr E. Sidney Hartland. Highgarth, Gloucester, on the subject of "The Sin-eater in Wales." The letter is written in answer to another correspondent. N, W. Thomas, who denied the existenceof the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the "Academy" twenty years and of the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World" of Febuary, 1882. Mr. Hartland claims that neither of these denials can outweigh the positive statements he cites in the earlier portion of his letter.

Editorial Comments
Quite a serious controversy has been waged in our oolumus, as well as those of the "Times," on the subject of the "Sin-eater" in Wales. The function of this individual is alleged to have been to attend funerals and consllm the sins oJ the defunct with cakts, washed doirn with nut-brown ale. It is alleged that sin-eating took place as late as 1852 at the village of Llandebie, in Car- marthenshire. Tiie matter was investigated by Silvan Evans, the lexicograplier, as well as the latf "Giraldus" (who was resident there at the very time), and wtlio buth failed to discover any foundation for the story. Still, the evidence for the "Sin-eater'' is not thus wholly got rid of, and equally extraordinary superstitions are to be met with in England and in other countries, so that no stone can reasonably be thrown at the Celt even if he did indulge these barbarous exeroises, relics as they are of a dark and credulous age.

THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES

TO THE: EDITOR OF THE WESTERN MAIL.

Sir-
A natural interest in thle place of my a birth prmopts me to ask you to give the death-blow, once for all, to the absurd figment which I find re-produced in the "Western Mail" of this mornin-g viz., that. "the superstition of the 'sin-eater' lingered even till 1881 in the secluded Vale of Cwmamman, in Carmarthenshire." When the late Mr. Paxton Hood first gave currency to the report in his "Life of Christinmas Evans", I, as well as others, asked some of the oldest reesidents of the place, whose memory reached back over 70 years, as to the truth of it, and they had never heard of the custom, which was said to prevail in their midst up to 1881. The late Dr. Rees, of Swansea, also naturally concerned that such a barbarous custom should be said to be practised by his countrymen towards the end of the nineteenth century, made the same inquiries, with the same result. I am not claiming for the secluded place of my birth an undue degree of enlightenment in asking you to "scotch " if it be hopeless to destroy entirely, the absurd idea which would, place it on a level with the most heathenish vas villages of Central Africa. -I am, &c.

J. LL. THOMAS, Vicar of Aberpergwm.

The "Times", the "Academy," and one of the Birmingham papers opened their columns to the discussion, and now a volume has appeared, entailed, "The Sim-Bater, and Other Stories," by Miss Fiona Macleod. of which a reviewer says "she (the authoress) has caught in no small degree the spirit of the Celt, with its gloom and superstition, its fixity of purpose, it harshness and nobility."

WAS THE SIBYL A CELTICI ORACLE. THE REPLY OF FOLKLORE AND I PHILOLOGY. INTERESTING THEORIES I DISCUSSED. To the Editor of the "Western Mail." I Sir,—Mr. J. 8: Fraur, the greit authority on folk-lore, has just brought out a new edition of Pausanius, in six volumes, including a most elaborate commentary. In the fifth volume, where Pausanlus's remarks about the Sibyls come under review, the author of the "Golden Bough" adduces from German collections of modern folk-lore the following stories (as pre- viously translated by Dr, M. R. James, and printed in the sixth volume of the "Classical Review") — "Once upon a time there was a girl in London whi wished to live for ever, go they say London, London is a fine town, A maiden prayed to live for ever. And still she lives ad hangs in a basket in a church, and every St. Johns Day about noon she eats a roll of bread." Another tells of "a lady who resided at I>an7.ig, and was so rich and so blest with all that life can give that she wished to live always. So when she came to her latter end she did not roally die, but only looked like dead, and very soon they found her In a hollow of a pillar in the churoh, halfattind- ing and half sitting, motionless. She stirred never a limb, but they saw quite plainly that aha was alive, and she sits there down to this blessed day. Every New Year's Day the sacris- tan comes and puts a morsel of the holy bread in her mouth, and that is all she has to live on. Long, long has she rued her fatal wish who sets this transient life above the eternal joys of Heaven." A third story tells of a noble damsel who cherished the same foolish wish for immor- tality. So they put her in a baskot and hung her up in a church, and there she hangs and never dies, though many, many a year has come and gone since they put her there. But every year on a certain day they give her a nil, and she eats it and cries out "For ever' for ever! for ever!" And when she has so cried she falls silent again till the Rame time next year, and so it will go on for ever ami for ever. The fourth anil last tale quoted by- Mr. Frazer, which was taken down near Oldenburg in Holstein, te]s of "a jolly dame that ate and drank and lived right merrily and had all that heart could desire, and she wished to live always. For the first hundred years all went well, but after that she began to shrink and shrivel up, till at last she could neither walk nor stand nor eat nor drink. But die she could not. At first they fed her as if she were a little child, but when she grew smaller and smaller they put her in a glass bottle and hung her up in the church, and there she still hangs in the Church of St. Mary at Lubeck. She is as small as a mouse, but once a year she stirs." The way in which Mr. Frazer quotes these interesting German folk-tales is a capital instance of a weakness that the scientific folk-lorist is prone to-it weakness that have already pointed out in my criticism of Mr. Sidney Hartland's treat- ment of the" Welsh Sin-eater." Mr. Frazer prints these tales in close connection with quo- t.ations of early references to oracular Sibyls in Roman and Greek authors of classical times. An unwary reader could not but connect them with the quotations from Petronius Arbiter, and the "exhortations to the Greeks attributed to Justin Martyr, and tTTe inscriptions found in the lately discovered cave of the Erythraean Sibyl. Now, it so happened that just before Mr. Frazer's Pausanius came into my hands I had been reading a great deal about Chris- tian symbolism. Among other material on that subject that was fresh in my memory was a little pamphlet by Mr. W. Marsh on the "Iconography of the Sibyls," where tho author, omitting the treatment of the Sibyls by the great masters—Michael Angelo, Perugino, Raphael, and so on-describes how they are treated in Books of Hours, frescoes, and church windows. It is all but an absolute certainty that the German folk-tales quoted by Mr. Frazer have their source in the ecclesiastical art, and that any direct influence traceable to the old Sibyl oracles is in the highest degree improbable. Yet Mr. Frazer ignores entirely the Sibyl legends of Christian symbolism (I say legends, for many of the pictured representa- tions include long-storied scrolls). His quota- tions, however, from earlier sources are more relevant to the illustration of his author, and one of them, the inscription from the Erythriean cave, is not, of course, in Alexandre's work on the Sibylline oracles, as that cave was only discovered in 1891. The short one has been restored to read thus:—"With good luck. The Erythraean Sibyl, daughter of a nymph and Thcodorus." The longer inscription is given as follows:—"I am the oracular Sibyl, the minister of Phoebus, eldest daughter of a Naiad nymph. My native land is Erythr», and no other, and Tlieodorus was my mortal sire. Cis- sotas was my birthplace, in which I uttered orae,e to mankind as soon as I had issued from the womb. And, seated on this rock, I sang to mortal men prophecies of events which were yet to come. And every thrice three hundred years, as an unwedded maid, I travelled over all the earth; and here, again, beside this dear rock I now sit delighting in the kindly waters. And I rejoice that the time has now come to me in which I said that Erythra) would flourish again, and would enjoy all good government and wealth and virtue, when a new Erythrus should have come again to his dear native land." This inscription is referred to the second century A.D.-the time of the Antonines. But I must hurry oil, and simply state here my opinion that the Sibyl of Cuma;, in Cam- pania. was, if not the earliest known to the Greeks. at any rate among the earliest. For I venture to suggest that the very name betrays her Western origin. The generally accepted derivation of that name, the Doric, sios-theos, and bolla-boule ("she that tells the will of God"), is all uncouth and far-fetched guess, in- dicating that the real meaning and origin were unknown to the Greeks. Now, to start with, the word looks like a genuine Latin diminu- ee, wSo::h lkii; gsad di I others. Is there a Latin word with which it can be connected? There i.. That word is sibus, which, with its compound per-sibus, is given by Festus as used by Plautus and Nævius in the sense of "acutus," "calliduq i' The feminine sibila might easily yield sibulla, and, in spite of the different quantity of the first syllable, it is not impossible that these words would be originally connected with sibiltis-a "hissing" or "whistling." There is another very strong argument for the Western deriva- tion of this oracle. Every schoolboy is familiar with the famous chaffering between Tarquin the Tyrant and the Cumaean Sibyl over the purchase of her fortune-telling book. In spite, however, of one'3 natural impression founded on that tale, the broad fact refnains that the oracles of the Cumeean Sibyl are chiefly distinguished from those of her nume- rous later sisters by some kind of defect in what I may call their literary promulgation. But to return to the derivation of the name: I do not know whether Sibus is a Latin word or not, but it has an undoubted cognate in Welsh. On p. 270 of Professor Rhys's "Celtic Heathen- dom" l find the following verses taten out of Skene's "Four Ancient Books of Wales" "Seith seren yøyd. o seithnawn dofyd, Seon sywedyd A wyr eu defnyd. Seven stars are there, Of the seven gifts of the Lord; Seon the philosopher. He knows their nature." "Sywedyd" means philosopher, or man of science, and is obviously derived from "syw." At the present day my impression is that "syw" has the meaning of "smart" or "trim." On referring to Pughe's Dictionary it, is quite clear that that eminent man had no real knowledge of the early meaning of the word. From the above-quoted old lines (pro- bably) he supposed that "sywedyd" meant "astronomer"; and so he renders "Dewi mawr Mynyw srw sywedydd," "Great Dewi of Mynyw a constant observer of the stars," and comes to the conclusion that "syw" meant "steady or "constant." I do not know if "syw" is found spelt "siw" in old manuscripts, but is is extremely likely that "siu" or "siv" was the early form of the word, and in that case it would be the very same word as the Latin sibus, with the meaning of "he who knows." From "siw" we get "siwin" (? the Irish salmon of knowledge) and "siwen" "an epithet for the mermaid" (Pughe). Not only that, but the Welsh word for eel (llyswen) seems to be of similar derivation. Salesbury spells that word "llyssowen," which represents exactly the pronuncia- tion known to me in my boyhood. It is not nnlikely that the mysterious migrations and habits of sewin and eels may have had scmethiiig to do with the sibylline supersti- tion. The important, position of salmon, and especially the salmon of knowledge in Irish folk-lore, is familiar to everybody; but even in Wales there are soma faint tre of similar beliefs. Professor Rhys draws nttention (L.C.M., pp 555, 558) to the salmon of Llyn Llyw, connected by the ntory of Knlhwch with the Severn (Welsh Haf-ren; Lat. Sab-rina), and says that it "had more to say than the other ancients questioned by Arthur's men, because he had lived longer in the world. I may also quote the following from Theophilus Jones's "History of Brecknockshire" "The sewin (a fish in high estimation in part )1 South Wales) is not found in many of the risers of Preconshlra, except the Tawe. And here ?nother 3bsezvation occurs, though, perhaps, it has seldom, if ever, been attended to. The sewin Is not seen in any river running in this country from ea«t to west, but in all those flowing in a contrary direction. I leave this circumstance to the natural philo- sopher to account for; the fact it as I have stated" (I. p. 16). Whether it is a fact or not it cannot be dissociated from the "wither- phins," "t=thpel." cr motion "against the sun" of folk-lore. That a marine origin may be almost certainly attributed to the sibyl also I gather from the Erythnean inscription given aoove. The "Exhortation to the Greeks" seems to Imply the same thing, while the evidence of old coias tends in the same direction. A very early coin of Cnmae at the British Museum has a female head on the observe, and a plftrix or "sea-eorpent" on the reverse. Another (not in the British Museum) figured in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography under the article "CumeB," has on the reverse a female's head and upper part, with her hand on what looks like an eel. bttt it may be a sea-serpent! I have not seen similar Agures on the old coinage of any other reputed seat of sibyls. I ought, perhaps, to mention that as Grote SI:Ot::rfû8' pto ;;n!,Ie::a:dG: I solitary Grecian establishment in the Tyrrhenian Sea—the Campanian Cumae, near Cape Jifisenum, which the more commcr. opinion of chronol igists supposed to have been founded in 1050 B.C., and which haoevsn been carried back by some authors to 1139 B.C. Without reposing any faith in this early chronology, we may, at least, feel certain that it is the most ancient Grecian establishment in any part of Italy." I have suggested ahove n, Welsh origin for the word under discussion. In view, however, of tho difficulty which Pughe seems to have encountered in dealing with "syw," the latter may, after all, lie another Irish survival in South "Wales In Irish, suadh—"cloak or gown of an Ollamh or professor: counsel, wisdom; also ad.1, discreet, wise"; and suaidh—"a wise man."—I am, Ac., J. P. OWEN. P.8.—The last sentence reminds me that I have found an exact parallel from Scotland to my suggested derivation of Waunglyncath. A particular spot in Strnthearn, a few miles from the famous Roman camp nt Ardoch (^ec "Penny Cyclopedia," Ii, V.), is called Strageth. "the valley of the fort." There are still to be eell there the remains of an old Roman station A careful examination by a competent military engineer of the country from the present Waun- glyncath and Cathilas, its far as the Turc.ui (that is the local pronunciation, not Turcarn), would not improbably result in some interest- ing diseoveri<5j.
