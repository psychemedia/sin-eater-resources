Folk-Lore, for June (Part 2. Vol. iii), published David Nutt, 270, Strand, contains an article on the Sin Eater by Mr Sidney Hartland (as to which subject some of our readers will remember an interesting corresopndence in the earlier volumes of *Bye-Gones*), the continuation Samoan Tales, "German Christmas and the Christmas Tree", "The Baker of Beauly", "Divination among the Malagasy"," The Pied Piper of Hamelin", and "First Foot in the British Isles". From "Exorcism in Wales," in Miscellanea, we take , the following :—

About 1842, the house of a relation of mine at Barmouth was haunted by noises, as if all the crockery in the cupboards and on the shelves were breaking, and other noises in different places which could not be accounted for. This went on for many weeks. A well-known conjurer and exorcist was sent for, but failed put stop to the disturbance, which got so bad that all the family— parents, children, and maids — left the house one night for refuge at the house of a relation who lived near. But as soon as they arrived there similar noises commenced in the corner cupboard of that house. Then, from mere bravado, the children said they would make as much noise as the spirit, so they got sticks and hammered the floors and doors and tables and tin kettles, &c., until the spirit-noise in the corner cupboard ceased, and for some time after. I was often told by them they made a regular Bedlam, merely from bravado to drown the noises of the "spirit" or whatever it was, never disturbed them after that night; they returned to their own house next morning, and never heard a repetition of the noises.
 
For many years before and after 1845 there lived an apothecary not beyond twelve miles from Machynlleth, who went to Machynlleth every market and fair day meet his customers and patients. I shall not mention his name, nor where lie lived, because some of his descendants are highly and deservedly respected. I shall call him Mr. H. (Humbug). He became noted as one having power to exorcise evil spirits which cause disease to man and beast by witchcraft. I remember an old woman who had a chronic sore on the bridge of her nose, and I was told many times it was Mr H. who caused it by his incantations to mark her and to check her, because she was witch. Mr H. was a deacon of the Church to which he belonged. On one occasion he was severely called to account at a Church-meeting for his dealings with evil spirits and witchcraft. He denied the charge, but had that many people came him, believing he could conjure or exorcise evil spirits, and he found that was useless for him tell them he had no such power, so, in order ease their minds, he wrote certain passages in Latin with hieroglyphic signs, which they used as charms, and they paid him willingly, much more willingly than for rational medicine. There was another elder of the same Church who had cow which he thought was bewitched, because she had been in ill health for long time, and no one could tell for certain what the disease was. He returned home late one Sunday night and told his son he had consulted H. that night about the cow, and Mr H. had written charm on paper, which was to be given to the cow without delay in pint of hot gruel. The charmed paper would drive the evil spirit of witchcraft out of the cow. The old man was too tired to prepare the gruel and give the charmed paper himself to the cow, as he had promised H., therefore he went to bed, and instructed his son to give the paper to the cow. His son prepared the gruel and gave it the cow, but he retained the charmed paper and brought it my father next morning, with a history related as above, and the history of the cow. The son had no belief in witchcraft, nor in Mr H., but he dare not let his own father know that he disobeyed the instruction of Mr. H. My father gave me the charmed paper, and I know I had it with other documents of a similar character since my return from India in I886, but I cannot find them now. It commenced with "Abracadabra” and signs of the Zodiac, then quoted verses from the Bible, Psalms, and the Prophets, and ended by charging the evil spirit to depart in the name of Godm Jesus Christ, and the angel Gabriel, &c. That is, so far as I can recollect it.

In 1868 I was informed by the owner of a farm that he had pulled down an old cow-house, and built a new one some years previously. He happened to be there one day when the workmen found a small box, much eaten and perforated by rust, in the wall of the old cow house which they were then pulling down. My friend, the owner, opened the box, and found in it a paper, a copy of which is given. Both the box and the original document found in it are now in my possession. My friend asked his tenant whether he could explain how the box and paper got into the wall The tenant said that many years before then his late father, a former tenant of that farm, lost several of his cows from some obscure disease which he believed was witchcraft. His father consulted H., and abtained from him a charmed paper in a tin-box which he was to hide the wall of the cow-house to ward off all evil spirits and witchcraft, and it appeared to have answered the purpose well, for there was no recurrence of the obscure disease after that, nor any reason to suspect witchcraft of any kind on the farm. The son did not know in what part of the wall his father hid the box and charmed paper, but he had no doubt those found were those given by Mr H. for the purpose protection against witchcraft. Afterwards too writing was identified with that of Mr H., though written in the name of the old farmer, who could not have written it himself — he could  notwrite his own name well.
