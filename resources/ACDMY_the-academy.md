AMONG curious customs and superstitions noticed in an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folk-lore of North Wales" there is one the singularity of which is heightened by the statement that it still survives in North and South Wales and the Border. At a funeral, "a hireling who lives by such services has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from walking after death." The scapegoat is currently called a "Sin-eater."

"LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES."

Llanymawddwy Rectory, Merioneth: November 8, 1875.

In the ACADEMY of November 6 (p. 478) I find an extract from an article in Blackwood on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death;" and this functionary, it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends.

"LEGENDS AND FOLK-LORE OF NORTH WALES": THE SIN-EATER, Hammersmith : Nov. 16, 1875.

Professor Evans has "never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period." May I be allowed to point out what appears to be the original passage from which the writer of the article drew the authority for his statement, and apparently its very words ? It occurs in a work so well-known as *Brand's Popular Antiquities* (Bohn's edition, 1849, vol. ii. 246-248), where the following is cited from Bagford’s letter, dated February 1, 1714-5, in Leland's *Collectanea*, i. 76 :—

"Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq."

The following words of Aubrey’s own are then quoted :—

"In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor peopie, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. Ono of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal) I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowlo, of muple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. . . . This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman deceased there had this cere- monie punctually performed, according to her will: and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." (*Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism.* Lansdowne MSS. 226, fol. 116.)

In a note the same writer adds that at Llanggors, Brecon, about 1640, Mr. Gwin, the minister, "could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome." And he says in another page of the MS. cited: "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales."

While these statements very clearly affirm the former prevalence, in North Wales and the Border, of the superstitious practice in question, they do not, of course, go to show that, in the words of the article, it is "still surviving" in those localities, as well as in South Wales. The writer, however, of the interesting compilation in *Blackwood* has little to tell us about surviving North Welsh superstitions, and less that is new. Some of those mentioned (e.g., that about pigeon's feathers, and the Bible and key or sieve spell to find'a thief) are common in various parts of England and Scotland; others, like the *Canwyll Corph* (Corpse Candle), are more or less satisfactorily referred to in well-known works— as in the *Choice Notes from Notes and Queries*, and in the old *Cambrian Quarterly Magazine*; other remarkable superstitions, again, alleged to be still living, such as that of the *Mallt y Nos*, or *Mam y Drwg* (Mother of Mischief), are not mentioned.

I venture to remark that the popular superstitions of Wales still await a student, acquainted with the Welsh language, and content, instead of seeking *folk*-lore from books, to collect it at the firesides of the people, in the out-of-the-way villages and secluded glens where it lingers longest.

In reference to the strange profession of "Sin- Eater," mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in *Blackwood* resides. Askew Roberts.

THE SIN-EATER. November 20, 1875.

Mr. Silvan Evans's ignorance of the superstition of the "Sin-eater" as connected with Wales and the Border counties surprises me the more as he has been for some years editor of the *Cambrian Archaeological Journal*; and during those years, if I mistake not, the second series of that valuable work has been carefully indexed. If he will turn to Ser. II., vol. iii. pp- 330, *seq.*, he will find that at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852 Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire. That which can be pointed to within a generation back may be said, speaking broadly, to "survive" or linger still; and I have only delayed writing these remarks in the hopes of hunting up a paper where, early in the present year, I found a notice of a still later case. Other of your correspondents have relieved me of the necessity of referring to instances of the "Sin-eater" custom cited by Leland, Aubrey, and others, as having occurred between 1686 and 1715 in three or four Herefordshire parishes, in Shropshire, *in the villages adjoining Wales*, at Llangorse, near Brecon, and elsewhere in North and South Wales.

I regret that my ignorance of Welsh precludes me from giving Mr. Evans the Welsh equivalent for the term. My article in *Blackwood* pretends to no such knowledge, though I regret, as a Borderer, that my education herein is imperfect.

Should I be able to trace the custom to a still later date than 1848 or 1852, no one will be better Pleased than myself to communicate the fact to the Academy.

Correspondence The Sin-Eater, by Prof. D. Silvan Evans

THE SIN-EATER.

Aberystwyth : Jan. 29, 1876.

At the risk of exposing my “ignorance” still further, and thereby causing additional surprise to the writer of the paper on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales" in *Blackwood’s Magazine*, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. Like every other country, the Principality had, and still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-eater does not appear to be among them. Since the appearance of my former letter in the ACADEMY (November 13), I have made all the enquiries I could into the subject, with the view of ascertaining whether such a personage has, or ever had, "a local habitation and a name" among us. I have spoken to many and corresponded with several persons who are known to have paid attention to the customs and traditions of the country; and the sum of their communications is, without any exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater was as novel to them as it was to me.

The writer points to Llandebie as the place where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. Matthew Moggridge at the annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852, and is "surprised" that I, who became connected with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* in 1872, should not be minutely acquainted with everything that appeared in that journal some twenty years previously, Whether I ever read the account of the Ludlow meeting I cannot now say; but if I did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge’s revelations had been effaced from my memory when I wrote my letter. The writer tells us that "at the meeting of the Cambrian archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for sentiments which he never expressed. The description of the sin-eater, given by Mr. Moggridge, is taken from Aubrey; and the following are his words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the organ of the Association :—

"In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt."

Out of this statement the author of the article makes “five years”! and by that process brings the custom down to 1847. Mr. Moggridge, in a letter dated the first day of the present year, tells me that he does "not remember anything that gives a date," and adds that “the only written account” of the sin-eater "from *personal* knowledge is that of Aubrey, 'de Gentilisme.'" Aubrey, if I may rely on the extracts given in the ACADEMY, does not say that he was eyewitness to the performances of the sin-eater in any part of *Wales*, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as having prevailed at any time in the Principality; and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of the Principality and not of the English counties.

But let us return to Llandebie, the locality in which it is asserted that the custom prevailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Rowlands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author of a small volume of *Historical Notes* published about ten years ago, and at one time librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these words :—

"I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, customs, and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of the 'sin-eater;' in fact people there never give cakes at funerals. I know almost every parish in South Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth."

Letters to the same effect appeared in the *Western Mail*, which circulates very extensively in the Principality, in the *Aberystwyth Observer*, and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin-eater.

The Rev. Rees Evans, Vicar of Llandebie, has favoured me with the following letter in answer to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on the part of your readers for inserting it without abridgment :—

"I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., which contained such extraordinary statements in reference to a superstitious custom supposed and alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the employment at funerals of a strange person called the 'sin-eater.' I have been the vicar of this parish for the last fourteen years, and I have known this neighbourhood well for the last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I received your letter of such a personage as the 'sin-eater.' However, with the view of arriving at the truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which appeared subsequently in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this parish, as to the probability of there having ever existed here such a functionary as 'sin-eater;' and the result of my investigation in the matter is this :—

That such a custom as that alluded to in your letter never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had long conversations while investigating the matter in question for you. One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I have made, my candid opinion is that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any credible evidence."

Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter of a century.

The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge as being still seen in some parts have no connexion, or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin-eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are given for their employment. They are not uncommon, I understand, among Roman Catholics at the present day.

The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just seen, he does not state that he saw any performance of the custom among the Welsh people. Those who only retail his statements need not detain us. I leave it to others to judge what amount of credibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part. If we put implicit belief in what he says about the sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, I do not see how we can consistently refuse his evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent.

In conclusion I would remark that if the custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is somewhat strange, if not "surprising," that the discovery of it has been exclusively confined to those who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the country.

THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES.
February 8, 1876.

I crave Mr. Silvan Evans's pardon for the hasty assumption that the editor of an Archaeological journal would possess or have access to a complete set of the past volumes, in which case he need not have denied in his first letter to the ACADEMY having ever heard of the Sin-eater in Wales, seeing that he now admits that if "he ever read Mr. Moggridge's revelations at Ludlow, they had been effaced from his memory" when he first wrote. To me he does not seem even now to have fully refreshed his memory; as after quoting a portion of Mr. Moggridge’s remarks at the Ludlow meeting in 1862, and calling Mr. Moggridge as a witness, at this distance of time, that "he does not remember anything that gives a date," he takes me to task *for making "five years!" out of that statement, and by that process bringing the custom down to* 1847. Had Mr. Evans turned over a leaf and read the last words of Mr. Moggridge on the occasion referred to, he would have found that they were to the effect that "he believed people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice: one case, he was informed, *occurred four or five years ago; but he believed it was extinct now.*" Perhaps, had I not wished to be succinct, I should have given Mr. Moggridge’s own words for the mountain valley in which, when he brought forward the subject in 1852, the practice was said to have existed till recently. But "at or near Llandebie" is a wide statement, and though the present vicar and the quondam schoolmaster may never have heard of the "Sin-eater," I am still disposed to believe that there must have been some foundation for Mr. Moggridge’s statement. Only last night, in the Introduction to Murray’s *Handbook to South Wales*, 1870 (the editor of which I am unacquainted with, although I have an impression that he was a medical man of eminence, connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works), I came upon this paragraph in p. xxvii: "The superstition of the sin-eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman in Caermarthenshire." I refer to the Ordnance Maps, and find Cwm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary*, refers to the same superstition, and if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr. Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practise on their credulity and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not widely removed from others which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius on 1 Cor. iv. 13 traces one such in Caesar’s account of the Gauls, B. ix, 6. That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious. Mr. Silvan Evans's parting shot at the discoverers "who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and but slightly acquainted with the country," shall not draw me from my incognito, or I might show him that by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, I am connected with two counties of South Wales, and that I have travelled frequently over most of the Principality, although I have failed to acquire its language.

P.S.—It occurs to me to add that the much-abused Aubrey was great-grandson to the owner of property in Brecknockshire and Glamorganshire; and that the "plate and salt," which have no connection with "sin-eating," are not confined to Roman Catholics.

The Sin-Eater, by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans and E. R. Morris.

THE "SIN-EATER."
Llanymawddwy : Feb. 12, 1876.

The question between the writer in Blackwood and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find that in his letter in the Academy of to-day he mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, leaving the point at issue just where it was. He stated in his article that the custom of the Sin-Eater prevails in North and South Wales at the present day; when I challenged that statement and asked for proof, we were told that by the present day he means some thirty years ago; and when pressed for the locality he goes under the aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebi "in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." When persons appeal to certain tribunals, they should not complain if they are sent to appear before the tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made on the spot by competent persons; and those who will take the trouble to read my last letter will see with what success, The Sin-Eater is as little known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. Now the writer shifts his ground and moves, under the enlightening guidance of Murray's *Handbook for Travellers in South Wales*, to Cwm Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The compiler of that volume, whether ever "connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works" or not, states nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal knowledge, or from the personal knowledge of any informants, but quotes almost the identical words of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight variation as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the February number of the Contemporary Review, simply relates the same story over again, without any corroboration of her own. A false story does not become truth by repetition, and these repetitions add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is simply waste of space to retail them.

The writer complains that I did not turn over a certain leaf in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, where he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeologists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating was carried on *at Llandebie until within five years of that time* (1852). The leaf had been turned over and read before I wrote my last letter; I turn it over again, and on it read the last utterances of Mr. Moggridge as follows :—

“Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of Sin-Eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped; and the rest still retained; and us he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thorough] ashamed of the practice; one case, he was infienel, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now.”

These are Mr. Moggridge’s last words at Ludlow, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it must be, as I understand him, to some part of  Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to be more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my remarks do not apply. Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants of the alleged sin-eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that the "more odious part of the custom has been removed," which amounts to begging the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly admits that he never witnessed the “horrid custom” at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs us that it “was said to have prevailed:” he does not mention his authorities, nor does he so much as hint what means his informants had of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no disrespect to him when I say that both the vicar and the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascertaining the facts of the case, on account of their connexion with the locality and their knowledge of the vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge’s opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of facts; and opinions, from whatever source they may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. The question at issue lies within the domain of fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge has any foundation on a more solid substance than "imagination all compact."

It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to “refresh” my memory respecting “the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scapegoat.” It is useless to argue about what may, could, or should have occurred, when we are concerned only with what has actually taken place. It is needless to expatiate on the possibility of a custom, when its existence is denied. The writer might have spared his sneering remark about: the "treason" of calling Welshmen "ignorant" and "superstitious." The qualities denoted by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are not confined to the Principality of Wales; and one at least of these benighted barbarians holds that it is treason against truth to make charges that cannot be substantiated against any nation, however "ignorant" or "superstitious" that nation may be. The writer seems to assume that it is “a point of national honour,” rather than any higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate groundless imputations. When “ national honour” and truth go together, “ national honour” is not to be contemned.

The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on ac- count of his incognito. He need not. It is perfectly immaterial whether he retains or doffs it; but it shall not shield him from the  consequences of making statements of questionable authenticity. He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales"; but he does not tell us that his ‘ancestors ever furnished him with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or that in his frequent visits to our benighted country he ever encountered that dread functionary. Such being the case, I confess to being a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees and broad acres in two or more counties, fine things as they are, to the subject we are now dis- cussing. More to the point is the admission that, notwithstanding his frequent travels "over most of the Principality" he has "failed to acquire its language," that language being the very key to its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, therefore, must resemble those of a blind man in quest of the beautiful.

If the writer proves, as he states in *Blackwood*, that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is "still surviving in North and South Wales," I shall at once confess my error, and the "national honour" shall take its chance; but if he fails to do this, he ought, in justice to the country of his "ancestry," to retract the groundless charge. He it is that has brought the accusation against it, and on him lies the burden of proof.

D. Silvan Evans.

Homestay, Newtown, Montgomeryshire : February 12, 1876.

Roscoe, in his *Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales*, quoting the author of the *Mountain Decameron*, locates "what is believed to have been the last Sin-Eater of Wales" differently from any mentioned in the Academy. I subjoin his remarks.

"A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete (the earlier part of the last century) gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last 'Sin-Eater of Wales.'

"'I got lost,' says he, 'near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was cautioned to ride far’ round this pitchy bog, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits, the whole being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse.

"'At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse’s hoof, and I saw a cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a distance.

"'The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground.

"'Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon, a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office— that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and ever.'

"This is the traveller's account of this incident. He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled, on the high road’s point, the straw of her husband’s late bed—the usual signal of a death in the house.

"The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dare by night, whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse."

Persons acquainted with the district readily recognise the locality from the above description, others may do so when I state that the Cambrian Railway, between Machynlleth and Aberystwith, traverses the "black turbary of great extent," and the high road from Aberdovey passes close by one of the railway stations on this line, called "Ynyslas." The custom of placing a late of salt on the breast of a dead person is, I imagine, not obsolete in this county yet; at any rate instances have occurred within my own knowledge.

THE SIN-EATER.
Croeswylan, Oswestry: Feb. 28, 1876.

My friend Mr. Morris, your latest contributor to the "Sin-Eater" correspondence, quotes the Mountain Decameron sketch of what is "believed to be the last sin-eater in Wales." I presume Mr. Morris quotes at second-hand, or he would have seen that he has only unearthed old Aubrey's "long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal." for, in the passage immediately before Roscoe’s quotation, the author says :— “Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom (but I have an idea by Mr. Kyrle, the 'Man of Ross'), which describes a 'Sin-Eater,' who 'lived by Ross highway, and is described as a 'gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor raskal.'"

If your readers will refer to Mr. Fitzgerald's letter on November 20, 1875, they will see that the "poor raskals" are identical; and Mr. Downes, the author of the Mountain Decameron (who dates his book "Builth, Breconshire, April, 1836 "), does not profess to do more than pen a fancy sketch on Aubrey’s text, laying his scene in Cardiganshire.

I fear Mr. Silvan Evans is as far off as ever from catching the real Simon Pure!

CORRESPONDENCE. THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 14, 1895.

During the recent discussion at the British Association meeting on cannibalism, I ventured to point out that there was reason to believe that the practice had once extended over a much wider area than we might be disposed a prior to think; and in support of my statement I referred, among other things, to the custom of Sin-eating, described by John Aubrey as existing in his time on the Welsh border and in Wales. This I explained as the relic of a more ancient custom of eating the corpse. My observations, when reported, called forth a letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, who, writing from Oswestry to the *Times*, absolutely denied the existence of the Sin-eater in Wales, declaring that "if the dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society," and calling my attention to the correspondence in the ACADEMY in the winter of 1875-76, in which Canon Silvan Evans, he seemed to think, had finally disposed of the evidence.

As a matter of fact, I had to confess that I had not heard of that correspondence, and I found some difficulty in getting it. By the courtesy of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Woodall, I have now had the opportunity of reading it, and my opinion is unchanged by the perusal. As it may be desirable that the question should be thrashed out in the arena where the first blow was struck, and as, moreover, the Sin-eater furnishes meat lacking, perhaps, something of the savour most appetising for readers of a daily newspaper, I ask you to allow me to review the evidence in your columns.

Before dealing with the negative evidence, let us see what positive evidence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr. Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey, who, we are told, is "none too strong a witness." It is true that the stories all go back to Aubrey, in the sense that he is the earliest writer to mention the custom, and that he gives the fullest account of it. He says (*Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme*, p. 35):

"In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of Bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the Defunct, aud freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead."

In Brand and Ellis’s *Observations on Popular Antiquities* (ed. 1813, vol. ii., p. 155) is reprinted from Leland's *Collectanea* a letter from a Mr. Bagford, giving a slightly varied account, professedly derived from Aubrey, placing the scene of the custom in Shropshire, the time "within the memory of our fathers," and stating the fee paid to the Sin-eater as a groat. On this, if it stood alone in reference to Shropshire, I should lay no stress. It might contain the result of additional inquiries by Aubrey; it might, on the other hand, be only the inaccurate recollection of a verbal communication by him to Mr. Bagford, really referring to Herefordshire. If we compare it, however, with the cases cited further on, we shall have reason to think that the custom actually obtained in Shropshire.

I do not know what grounds Mr. Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey's testimony. Aubrey was a careful and enlightened inquirer into old customs; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open; his *bona fides* is not to be questioned; and his description of the ceremony, and the expressions he makes use of, testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statements than casual gossip. A little lower down he adds:

"This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian goverment: as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish, the relations of a woman deceased there had this Ceremonie punctually performed according to her will: and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this Countis: as also in Brecon, e.g. at Lllangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome."

Aubrey does not, indeed, profess to have himself witnessed these  instances of the ceremony. If we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye-witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt.

Leaving for the moment what he says about Llangors, I pass to Derbyshire, a district where the Britons long maintained their independence, and the population of which is probably still to a great extent of Celtic ancestry. Recent inquiries by Mr. S. O. Addy have shown that

"at a funeral in Derbyshire wine is first offered to the bearers who carry the corpse. This custom is strictly maintained, the guests not receiving any wive until the funeral party has returned from church... . When you drink wine at a funeral, every drop that you drink is a sin which the deceased has committed. You thereby take away the dead man's sins and bear them yourself" (*Household Tales, with other Traditional Remains, collected in the Counties of York, Lincoln, Derby, and Nottingham*, 1895, pp. 123, 124).

This, there can hardly be a doubt, is a survival of a similar custom to that of the Sin-eater. The same effect is assigned to the act of drinking; and the ritual requires that the wine should first be offered to certain of the funeral officials.

Returning to Shropshire, we find a drinking custom recorded by an eye-witness in the reign of Charles II. M. Jorevin, apparently a Frenchman travelling in England, relates that he was present at a nobleman's funeral at Shrewsbury. The minister made a funeral oration to the assembled friends and relatives in the chamber where the body lay. "During the oration there stood upon the coffin a large Pot of Wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased." When this was finished the funeral proceeded. (Brand and Ellis, vol. ii., p. 153.) It is true that there is no special Sin-eater here, nor any words indicating the assumption by the survivors of the sins of the dead. But it will be observed that the health of the deceased can mean only "the ease and rest of the soul departed," which is exactly the expression placed in the Sin- eater's mouth by Mr. Bagford. The ceremony, in fact, looks uncommonly like that of Sin-eating transplanted to an upper stratum of society, and accompanied by modifications such as that transplantation would in course of time evolve, The same custom was still practised at Market Drayton as lately as July 1, 1893. Miss Gertrude Hope, writing in Folklore (vol. iv., p. 392), gives the particulars as related to her by an eye-witness. After the bearers had lunched, "the coffin was brought down and placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, and, the mourners having gathered round it," a short service was then and there conducted by the Nonconformist minister, as is frequently done, before setting out for the grave. "Directly the minister ended the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present across the coffin, with a biscuit called a 'funeral biscuit.'" Mark what follows. "The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it.in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been." Here the food and drink were handed across the coffin to the bearers—the same officials who in Derbyshire first partake in a formal manner of the drink which is believed to have the effect of taking away the sins of the deceased. The relation of the ceremony to that of the Sin-eater is apparent. The evidence, if not literally at first hand, is such as cannot be doubted.

If, fortified by this evidence from Derbyshire and the Marches, we turn to Wales, we find Aubrey’s statements of a very circumstantial character ; and that not merely in the case of Llangors referred to just now. Speaking of offertories at funerals, he says (*Remains*, p 23):

"These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye Ch. of Engl. Comon-Prayer booke: but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North-Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingraved on it, & ye parties name deceased, wich one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps, and this Custome is used to this day [1686] in North Wales."

This is precisely the ceremony of Sin-eating, save that Aubrey does not record the words uttered. The testimony is perhaps all the stronger that he does not thus expressly connect it with a practice which he elsewhere declares he believed to have been "used over all Wales." It would seem that he had actually beheld it in this shape; though his words are not free from ambiguity. At all events, it is clear that he had made minute inquiries. A century later Pennant describes the same custom among several others "used among us in former times, which have been gradually dropped in —— as the age grew enlightened." He says:

"Previous to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister or daughter (for it must be a female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and required the person to drink alittle of it immediately. When that was done, they kneeled down, and the minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer; after which, they proceeded with the corpse (*Tours in Wales*", ed. 1883, vol. iii., p. 150).

Pennant was born and lived in Wales; and we must suppose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours and friends, if he had not himself witnessed it.

The explicit statements of Aubrey and Pennant must be put side by side with the evidence already given of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And, since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the Sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr. Matthew Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie, a few miles from Swansea, down to a few years before 1852, when he read a paper on the subject at Ludlow to the Cambrian Archaeological Association. It is unnecessary to quote the paper, which is to be read in *Archaeologia Cambrensis* (vol. iii., N.S., p. 330), as it mentions no material variation of the ceremony. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us, found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited; but in deference to them, it is probable that a compromise would be adopted. The acts would continue to be performed, the words interpreting and completing those acts would be dropped.

I will ask permission to consider the negative evidence in another letter.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

II.

Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 25, 1895.

Before I examine the negative evidence, let me revert for a moment to Pennant’s statement cited in my previous letter. I am indebted to Mr. J. P. Owen, who, writing lately to Prof. Rhys, has pointed out that this statement is derived from the same source as an account of "Ancient Usages and Customs in North Wales," contained in the *British Magazine* for April, 1835 (vol. vii., p. 399), and there said to be "from a MS. book of a Bishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago." The British Magazine is now lying before me, and the passage runs as follows:

"When the corpse is brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, and covered before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased —widow, mother, daughter, or cousin (never done by a man)— gives cross over the corpse to one of the poorest neighbours two or three white loaves of bread and a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor body that receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister (if present) saith the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward towards church."

The way in which Pennant deals with the entire account, omitting or varying some usages and inserting others, suggests that, though he unquestionably had the MS. or a copy of it before him, he supplemented or varied it in accordance with information obtained elsewhere. In the passage I have quoted I would draw attention, for example, to his graphic touches the loaves as presented "in a great dish," and bringing the funeral party before us as kneeling down when the Lord’s Prayer was repeated, which are not to be found in the *British Magazine*. Perhaps the omissions may be equally significant, but naturally they are less to be trusted. The whole account should, however, be compared, for doing which I have no space here. In any case, the detail of "a new wooden cup," overlooked or purposely left out by Pennant, is worth noting as an independent confirmation of Aubrey some half century after he wrote.

Now, what is the negative evidence? It amounts to this :

1. Canon Silvan Evans himself, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folk-lore, never found a trace of the custom; nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature.

2. He made inquiries in the year 1875 of the Vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr. Rowland, the schoolmaster, denied the existence of — practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish, of whom the vicar inquired, also denied it.

3. The Rev. T. Eynon Davies also denied it ia reference to Cwmamman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the declarations of octogenarians.

None of these denials, nor all of them together, can outweigh the positive evidence of Aubrey, Pennant, and the minister at Market Drayton. Even if we assume, what I do not see my way at present to admit, namely, that Pennant was merely reproducing the statement of the Bishop of St. Asaph (or whoever may have been the writer of his MS.), it is clear that the latter was describing the custom as still subsisting when he wrote. Thus, the custom that certainly existed uncurtailed in the seventeenth century at Llangors maintained itself, shorn of the ritual words, well into the eighteenth century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembrokeshire. We may be sure it did not maintain itself only in these places. I do not understand that Canon Silvan Evans's denials extend to England. But to admit the existence of the practices (and they can hardly be denied) in Shropshire and Derbyshire is to lend strong countenance to the probability of similar practices in many districts of Wales. Mr. Matthew Moggridge did not claim to have been an eye-witness — we cannot even affirm that he saw and examined eye-witnesses; but it is possible, and even likely, that he did, seeing that he lived at Swansea, only twelve or thirteen miles from Llandebie. His assertions. at any rate, were evidently not made at random, but were the result of investigations. He may have been misled. So may Aubrey and the writer of the Bishop of St. Asaph's MS. In that event it is remarkable that the accounts they give, while agreeing in the main, present just the differences we might expect from independent writers describing a custom liable to all the variations of traditional practice. Nor will the hypothesis that these writers were misled get rid of the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton. He at least could not have been mistaken about a custom which he had himself succeeded in putting down.

It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans's inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeed, was, we are told, an old resident ; but the clergyman had only been vicar for fourteen years, though he described himself as having known the neighbourhood well for twenty-five years, which may mean much or little. We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference. In any case, they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition if it existed. The Rev. Elias Owen, diocesan inspector of schools, and one of the chief authorities on Welsh folk-lore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitions of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse, "*Our* people are not superstitious, I am glad to say." His inspection over, he asked the first class, "Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a *buggan* (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of anyone who has seen one?" Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is, the people hide their superstitions from all such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommon experience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well-known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev. C. F. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel "Witch-burning" inquiry, is of the greatest weight on this point. He said he had heard "nothing, absolutely nothing," of the doings which ended in the unfortunate victim’s death, until all was over. Asked if he did not think that very extraordinary, he replied :

"No, I do not. The priest is very often the last to hear of things like that—generally, I should say... I had no suspicion of foul play or witchcraft, and if I had 1 should have at once absolutely refused to say mass in the house, and have given information to the police at once."

The reason of the concealment from the priest or the minister comes out here. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages to the ancient superstitions.

So far, then, as regards the actual practice of Sin-eating in Wales in modern times, it must be said, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognised by everyone), that his denials and the results of his inquiries do not countervail the positive evidence; and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev. Eynon Davies, whose inquiries were made later still. But in order to complete the case, I must add something as to Canon Evans’s failure to find any allusion to the Sin-eater in Welsh literature. This, however, I shall have to reserve for next week.

CORRESPONDENCE. THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

III.

Highgarth, Gloucester: Nov. 4, 1895.

I have now dealt with the positive evidence derived from English sources— that is to say, from writings in the English language— and with the negative evidence of the inquiries by Canon Silvan Evans at Llandebie and by the Rev. Eynon Davies at Cwmamman, and of the general acquaintance of the former with Welsh folk-lore.

But Canon Evans not only failed to trace the Sin-eater in Welsh folk-lore; he failed also to trace him in Welsh literature. Here he has me at a disadvantage. I am not conversant, as he is, with Welsh literature. I do not doubt, however, that many English customs have existed, and perhaps exist even yet, of which no indication can be found in ordinary English literature; and it may be the same in Wales. But I should like to ask: what has he looked for, and how has he looked for it? He is himself a lexicographer of distinction ; and he is doubtless acquainted with the work of his predecessor, Owen Pughe. If he will turn to the letter D he will find the word *Diawdlestr* thus defined: "A drinking cup, also a cup full of drink so-called, superstitiously given for the dead, which in some places is called *diawdlyst*, and *cwpan y meirw*"; and *Diawdlyst* is explained as "The give-ale." I owe this reference to Mr. Owen. Prof. Rhys has been kind enough to make a little further search. He has turned up in Thomas Richards's *Welsh and English Dictionary* (Trefriw, 1815) what seems to be one form, if not the original and true form, of Pughes’s *Diawdlyst*, namely *Diodlifft*, explained by *Cwppan dros y meirw* (a cup for, or on behalf of, the dead), with a reference to "Davies." The reference to Davies seems to be not to Davies's still older Welsh Dictionary, but rather to his "MS. notes." We have here at least three words expressive of a cup of drink superstitiously given for the dead, pointing not to an isolated, but to a widely known custom of some kind. To what can they point, if not to the practices detailed in my first letter and in the extract from the Bishop of St. Aseph's MS, ? And that they do in fact refer to hem there is proof in Welsh literature.

*Cymru Fu* is a little book published anonymously at Wrexham, bearing no date on the title-page, but having the preface dated 1862. It is a sort of *omnium gatherum* of Welsh history, literature, and traditions. Among other things, it contains an account of popular funeral customs. The portion (p. 91) which is pertinent to my present purpose, runs as follows :

"Before the sad procession started for the church the friends and nearest relations collected about the corpse to bewail and lament their loss, while the rest of the company were in another room drinking warm beer and smoking their pipes, and the women in another room still were drinking tea together. After the coffin was carried out of the house and laid on the bier beside the door, one of the relations of the deceased gave bread and cheese over the coffin to poor people, who, in expectation of these gifts, had been diligently gathering flowers and herbs to bestow in the coffin. Sometimes a loaf of bread with a piece of mone stuck in it was added to these [gifts]. Then all the mourners knelt down, and the clergyman, if present, repeated the Lord's Prayer, and the procession stopped and repeated the same prayer at every cross-way until they reached the church."

I think it is undeniable that the writer had Pennant before him while writing this passage ; and I have purposely translated it so as to bring out the identities of expression. But allowing for this, it is clear that he has other sources of information from which he adds particulars given neither by Pennant nor in the Bishop of St. Asaph's MS. Such are the description of the proceedings before the corpse was taken out of the house, and the details of where the coffin was placed outside the house (*gerllaw y drws*), and of the presentation of flowers and herbs in return for the bread and cheese.

Scepticism, however, may deny the authority of so modern a compilation as *Cymru Fu*. Let me, therefore, turn to an account of the same custom, written at least forty years earlier. It occurs in a little book called *Drych y Amseroedd* [Wikipedia](https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drych_yr_Amseroedd) [book](https://viewer.library.wales/4794349). The purport of the book is described in the title-page, which may be rendered : "Mirror of the Times; comprising a little of the history of the most remarkable things that have happened, chiefly in Gwynedd, during the last two centuries in relation to religion. In the form of a conversation between Inquisitive and Observer."

Its author was a Calvinistic Methodist minister, named Robert Jones, of Capel y Dinas, previously of Rhoslan; and it was published at Llanrwst, presumably in 1820, for that is the date of the preface, though there is none on the title-page to the second edition, to which alone I have access. In the course of the conversation, Inquisitive says (p. 50) :—

"I remember hearing my grandfather talk about something called *Dïodas* or *Dïodles*. Can you tell me what it was ?" And Observer replies :

"When someone happened to die in a family, a certain poor man was chosen by the family to have the favour of receiving that happy charity, the *dïodles*. The manner of giving it to the poor man was this: the family sent to the workman who made the coffin a cup to be coloured the same colour as the coffin. Two colours were customary for coffins at that time: black for the coffins of married, and white for those of unmarried persons. When the day of the funeral came, after putting the corpse on the bier, the head of the house presented the superstitious alms to the poor man— namely, a large loaf of good bread, an ample piece of cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, and the coloured cup full of beer, if there was any, or else of milk, reaching them over the corpse to the poor man. He in return blessed and prayed fervently and earnestly with the dead man’s soul [*gyd dg enaid y marw*]."

The last sentence is one of some difficulty. But, whatever the true rendering, it cannot denied that we have in the custom described a practice of giving a cup full of drink for, or on behalf of, the dead. The bread, cheese, and money are of course given for the same purpose; and prayers and blessings of no ordinary kind are expected and given in return. If this be not a local variant of the practice delineated by Aubrey—a variant, moreover, affected by the natural ceremonial decay of, say, two more generations—perhaps Canon Silvan Evans or Mr. Thomas will have the goodness to tell us what it is, or how he would propose to discredit the witness. Until then I shall hold, as I think most of the readers of these letters will hold, that it is strong and independent confirmation of the existence of the custom of sin-eating, or, what is the same thing, of sin-drinking in Wales. How is it, then, that Canon Silvan Evans has been unable to trace it in Welsh literature? The explanation lies, I believe, in his having looked for a functionary called the Sin-eater, and for a Welsh form of the word "sin-eater," while students of tradition would look for the custom. He has missed the substance in seeking for the shadow. And yet I think I have shown that even the search for the shadow need not have been in vain. There are, at least, four words in the language expressive of the custom, or of the cup with which it was performed: *Cwpan y meirw*, the cup of the dead; *Diawdlestr* or *Diodlestr*, the cup of drink superstitiously given for the dead; *Diodlifft*, which Prof. Rhys suggests to me, is, perhaps, partly an English loan-word, meaning the drink lifted over the dead; and, lastly, the *Dïodles*, the Venedotian word for the custom, meaning possibly the drink-boon. Canon Evans's great dictionary has not yet progressed beyond the letter C. I do not know why he has omitted *Cwpan y meirw* from it: no doubt not without some reason. When he publishes D he will have an opportunity of explaining the other three words, and incidentally of telling us why he passed over the curious *Cwpan y meirw*.

I have now shown, by examination both of the positive and of the negative evidence, that there is abundant ground for believing in the existence of the custom of sin-eating in Wales. I have shown it in the Marches down to the year 1893; I have shown it in Brecknockshire in the seventeenth century; I have shown it in Pembrokeshire down to recent years ; I have shown it in Powisland in the eighteenth century; I have shown that in Gwynedd, or the western part of North Wales, it had not died out of memory in the year 1820, though probably it was no longer practised. The united force of the testimony I have adduced— concurrent, be it remembered, in its main lines, and not diverging in detail more than we might reasonably expect from the differences of locality and of time—is very great; nor can it be set aside by pooh-poohing Aubrey. I might have adduced other English evidence ; and where Canon Silvan Evans has failed to find evidence lying upon the surface of Welsh literature—nay, in his very path as a philologist—it is not impossible that careful inquiry may discover further references to the custom. Even as the matter stands, however, it is amply proved. I have dealt with its meaning in the second volume of my *Legend of Perseus*, lately published by Mr. David Nutt, and have there traced parallel practices over a large part of Europe, and, indeed, of the world. Here I will only add that I believe it to be an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity, originating probably in the custom, expressly ascribed by Strabo to the Irish, of the eating of dead parents. If so, Mr. Thomas may derive some comfort from the conjecture that after all the custom properly belongs rather to the Goidelic, than to the Cymric branch of the Celtic race. Upon this speculation it is not my business to enter.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

I.

London : Nov. 25, 1895.

Mr. E. Sidney Hartland, in his article in *Folk-lore*, in his paper read before the British Association, in his two letters in the *Times*, and his three letters in the ACADEMY, has attempted to prove the existence of what Aubrey said was known in Herefordshire, and what Mr. Moggridge, of Swansea, said was known in the neighbourhood of Llandebie, Carmarthenshire, as "Sin-eating." He has also attempted to prove that the alleged custom is "Celtic." He has also attempted to prove that the Welsh funeral custom of the *diodles*, as described by Robert Jones, Bingley—both of whom give the Welsh name — Wirt Sikes, Evans, Peter Roberts, Pennant, &c., is a mutilated survival of a cannibalistic savage rite formerly practised by "the Celts," the central feature of which was "eating the corpse." I venture to submit that he has failed entirely in making out his case. Moreover, he has committed the blunder of withholding evidence that militated against his theory. That evidence he had himself expressly stated to me, weeks before the appearance of his first letter in these pages, to be "far and away the strongest" he had seen. How unfortunate the omission is may be gathered from the fact that the evidence in question affords a plausible explanation of what is otherwise inexplicable: I mean Mr. Moggridge’s reply to the late Mr. E. A. Freeman’s question at Ludlow. Mr. Hartland says (ACADEMY, November 9) that it was "unnecessary to quote" Mr. Moggridge’s paper. Therein I differ from him, and beg leave to quote somewhat regarding the amusing little comedy of errors enacted by the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow :

"Mr. Moggridge (of the Willows, Swansea), after describing the Sin-eater, said that in Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed toa recent period. . . . [Later on he said] that 'he believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now.' Mr. E. A. Freeman inquired whether Sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed. Mr. Moggrid replied in the affirmative" (*Arch. Camb.*, 1852, vol. iii., N.S., p. 330).

There were present at that meeting several Welshmen who are (I believe) still alive. One certainly is the Bishop of St. David's. I am under the impression that the Bishop knows the Welsh language, and can speak it fluently. It would be very interesting to get his Lordship's account of what really passed at the meeting. *He* must have known that it was impossible for a Welsh custom to "prevail"? in a Welsh mountain valley in the heart of Welsh Wales without having a Welsh name. Yet it was left to Mr. Freeman to investigate Mr. Moggridge's staggering statement, and of course the latter’s "reply in the affirmative" was bound to silence the Englishman. Now the mountain valley in question—Cwmamman —may have been "lawless" as regards fighting, poaching, and trifles of that sort, up to the commencement of this century. As an outlying district of the huge parish of Llandilo, it had no church until about fifty years ago, but it had plenty of chapels. The Independents had by far the largest congregation; and when I first remember it, in the early sixties, its minister was one of the most famous preachers in South Wales, the Rev. John Davies, an extremely handsome, old-fashioned gentleman of the finest manners, who always wore swallow-tails and knee-breeches. A relative of my own—the Rev. W. I. Morris, of Pontypridd — then a grown-up man, had, I think, lived up to that time in Cwmamman. I used to spend a day or two regularly once a month or so at his father's house, where I revelled in the *Traethodydd, Adolygydd*, and other Welsh periodicals, of which they had a plentiful store. As I am writing, it suddenly occurs to me that an article on Cwmamman and its characters appeared in the *Beirniad* quarterly review some time in the sixties. And now for my suggestion. I think it is beyond a doubt that Mr. Moggridge had some foundation for his assertion, and that it reached him somehow or other from Llandebie. The vicar of Llandebie, as also of the neighbouring parish of Bettws, from 1804 to 1850, was the Rev. John Williams. The road from Llandebie to Bettws runs right across the opening of Cwmamman. Well, after the old vicar's death, my father bought at the vicarage sale a quantity of Welsh books and periodicals. Among them was Robert Jones of Rhoslan’s *Drych*, which was a great favourite of mine when a boy. It must be borne in mind that that is a North Walian work, and that *diodles*, or *diodlys*, is a North Walian term. In the Welsh-English Dictionary by "T. Lewis and others," published at Carmarthen in 1805, there is no mention of *diodlys, cwpan y meirw, clul coffa, bwyd cenad meirw, bara rhan,* or *cacen gwyl y meirw*. The term, therefore, most probably heard by Mr. Moggridge was the term applied to the North Walian custom described by Robert Jones; and that it came either directly or indirectly from the vicar of Llandebie is very possible. This may appear to an Englishman a very minute point to attach importance to; but it must be remembered that in Welsh Wales (in Llandebie at any rate) there is not a field, nor a clump of trees, nor a rivulet, nor a custom, that has not its own appropriate name. In a succeeding letter I propose to deal with Aubrey, with Miss Hope's Pembrokeshire minister, and with each item of the North Walian custom described by Pennant and others.

CORRESPONDENCE.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

II.

London: Nov. 30, 1895.

The following digression will, I am afraid, lengthen my answer to Mr. Hartland ; but, as it contains matter probably novel to most readers, I venture to trespass on the editor’s kindness. 
The other day I looked into *Seren Gomer*, vol. i, (1818), as I remembered having seen, many years ago, a well-written paper on "Superstitions” in some early number of that periodical. I found the paper easily enough ; on reading it, not only the instances of super-stition, but the order in which they were related seemed quite familiar to me. I was rather puzzled at this, but that very evening the mystery was cleared up. The paper had been "conveyed" bodily, with just sufficient change to conceal the source from an inquisitive eye, from No. 59 of the *Connoisseur* (March 13, 1755) [online](https://archive.org/details/sim_connoisseur-by-mr-town-critic-and-censor-general_1755-03-13_1_59/page/n1/mode/2up). If the reader will look up that paper, he will see that it does not profess to have the slightest relation to Welsh superstitions. How many times, I wonder, has that veracious account been quoted as genuine folk-lore of the Swansea district ?

Of quite a different kind is the paper on the "Old Rhymesters [*Prydyddion*] of Cwmamman and Llanguick" in the *Beirniad* for October, 1862 (vol. iv., pp. 204-220) [online](https://journals.library.wales/view/2179996/2181214/59#?xywh=-1477%2C-4%2C5109%2C3370), to which I alluded in my previous note. Cwmamman, it may be remembered, is the "lawless mountain valley" of Mr. Moggridge's tale. The paper in the *Beirniad* presents a ver vivid picture of the manners and customs of that valley in the eighteenth century, founded apparently on the recollections of aged inhabitants. During the period the writer deals with the Cwmamman folk seem to have been, under a very rough exterior, an intelligent and keen-witted race. The men were clad in coat and waistcoat of homespun, grey cloth breeches buckled at the knee, black (undyed) woollen hose, and shoes with huge buckles, "The young men never parted the hair on their foreheads." Women and girls wore flannel dresses, cloth hats, and wooden clogs. When boot-polish and umbrellas came into fashion, the old people prayed to be removed to heaven, "since pride and the devil had taken possession of the old *Cwm*." They delighted in stories of hunting and tales of corpse-candles, and in making rhymes on one another. (This was long before the revival of the Eisteddfod, some eighty years ago.) Many of the old rhymes are quoted in the paper, and some of them I remember quite well.

I have said in my previous note that the Independents were the most important religious body in the valley. Between these and their older established Presbyterian (i.e, Unitarian) rivals, whose chapel was (and is) at Gellionen, there were smart debates on the deep things of theology. Here is a stanza taken at random from a long ballad which is quoted in full in the article:

"I know that Death's opinion of Jesus on the Rood  Was simply the Sccinian's—that but a Man there stood ;  But at the third day's dawning he found himself mista'en—  'Twas Jesus rose in triumph, *Death* wore the captive’s chain."

I do not think that such an institution as "sin eating" had much chance of flourishing in that soil; for it must be borne in mind that these rhymesters were not ministers, preachers, or "poets" with Eisteddfodic fancy names, but plain yokels—masons, millers, weavers, blacksmiths, and small farmers.

The old custom of struggling for the bride still survived. The bridegroom would take with him some rhymers as *guiders* (*sic*); and on reaching the bride's home they would find the door closed, and a great force of hostile bards ready for them inside. The verbal contest would take place through the closed door. [See also: Mari Lwyd, Christmas Custom] If the rhymers happened to be poor hands at "poetry," the struggle would soon be over, and the young woman be allowed to reach the church before twelve o'clock. But, woe worth the day, if a good supply of doggrel should be forthcoming, the wedding would inevitably have to be postponed!

Here is a sample of the verses used on such occasions : 
"Dafydd (a *guider*, outside) *loquitur* :  'At Cana's feast in Galilee  The first of marriages we see;  At Ystrad here, I dare to say,  The next takes place this very day.'

"Richard (inside) *respondet* :  'If Cana's feast in Galilee  The first of marriages did see,  Come, tell me (and my mind relieve)  *What* was our good old mother Eve ?'"

There is one curious paragraph which may afford a clue to the mystery of the Moggridge story. There are indications (such as the use of *cwbl*, meaning "whole," where "dole" seems to be required by the context) that it is taken from an English source. It seems that a report had spread afar that the old inhabitants of Cwmamman were awfully bad people (*dynion drwg ofnadwy*), and shameful thieves (*lladron cywilyddus*); but we are assured that there was no foundation for that old fable (*yr hen chwedl hono*). It originated in the fact that Shön Holi the beggar man (*Sion Holi y cardotyn*) had taken offence "because they had not given the whole to him" (*am na roddasent y ewbl iddo ef*), and that he had spitefully cried out :

"Cwmamman men, both great and small,  The devil owns you, one and all ;  And if your sins you do not rue,  He'll come and fetch you, two by two."

But Cwmamman had yet another curious institution. The inhabitants did not go to law; but their rhymesters settled all disputes and punished all offences. An instance is given. An old woman is cited before the rhyming court, and William Rees, the weaver, testifies :

"I know (but ’tis from hearsay)  That Pali stole the stake away  I'd in the thorn-fence fixed with skill,  To guard the meadow of the mill."

Hearsay, however, would not do, so William goes on:

"I'll prove that she where’er she goes  Is to the hedges worst of foes ;  There's not a stake in all the lands—  She steals them all for fire-brands!"

The court finds Pali guilty; and home she goes, begging that "no more poetry may be made on her, and promising that, as far as she have rest for the future."

And who was Pali?

Well, all that my author—of whom I here take leave—says is, that she was Pali Sion *Aubrey*. She must therefore have been either the daughter or the wife of John Aubrey. Aubrey's degree of cousinship to the famous author of the *Miscellanies* might be easily traced, I should think, by the aid of the Aubrey pedigrees in of the County of Brecknock. Not a little of the land lying between Cwmamman and Llangorse (near Brecon) belonged at one time to different descendants of Dr. Aubrey, Master of Requests in Elizabeth’s reign. Jones, in his History, mentions no peculiar custom connected with Llangorse. He quotes *Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy* as his authority for the statement that Rowland Gwynn was parson of Llangorse till 1640, when he was ejected, and the "cure lay vacant for three years, saving that one John Edwards, a shoemaker, sometimes preached by the Commissioners' orders." The first volume of Jones's History was published in 1805, and he writes as follows concerning Welsh funeral customs (p. 287):

"The funerals in Wales and the ceremonies preceding and following them very much resemble those of the Irish as described in that admirable little volume entitled *Castle Rackrent*. The straw on which the deceased lay is set on fire as soon as the breath departs, which is a signal of that event : we have our *gwylnôs*, or night of watching, and when ale can be procured in the neighbourhood a *llawen-nôs*, or night of rejoicing, though this latter phrase is more generally appropriated to the night before the wedding."

The simplest explanation of burning the straw-bed seems to be fear of infection. The home of the famous medical family, *Meddygon Myddfai*, was not far from that part of Breconshire, and some of their lore was widely spread by tradition. Another quotation from Theophilus Jones may afford Mr. Hartland more satisfaction :

"It is said that formerly the articles of consumption esteemed as the greatest luxuries in the Principality were— 
'A toasted Welsh rabbit  And a Sais off the gibbet.  (*Ibid*, p. 281.)"

In a footnote he adds: "Here is an opportunity for a triumph against the Celt, as Mr. Pinkerton may argue that the Welsh were not only savages but cannibals."

I pointed out to Mr. Hartland, in reference to the Market Drayton story, that, as it stood, the mysterious and "significant" remark of the Pembrokeshire minister was of no historical or scientific value whatever. As he seemed to agree with me to a certain extent, I was rather surprised to find the minister's oracular remark assuming in the ACADEMY even more "significance" than it had been originally endowed with in the Times. As a matter of fact, there are extant precise descriptions of Pembrokeshire funeral customs. I may refer to, though I am at present unable to quote from, Miss Mary Curtis's Antiquities of Pendine. Again, in part iii. of *Cymru Fu* for July-December, 1888— not the Welsh work that Mr. Hartland quotes from, but a republication of notes that had appeared in the Cardiff *Weekly Mail*— the following account, dated Tenby, Sunday, October 6, is to be found under the heading, “Travelling in Wales in 1820”:

"Going down the street of Tenby, I observed a number of men in their best clothes, principally black. I at first thought it was for Sunday, but seeing a woman among them with a tray and glasses in one hand and a bottle in the other, I stopt (being then on foot, to ease the horses in ascending a hill at the end of the town) to inquire the meaning of it, when one of the men informed me they were to attend a funeral, and that it was the custom to aseemble before the door of the deceased, and to be served with wine and warm ale in the street before the body was brought out. It is a Flemish custom, I suppose."

The writer had previously mentioned that "Tenby was of Flemish origin." In all the South Walian accounts that I have seen, the custom appears to have been of a much less elaborate character than was the case in the north. The reason is not far to seek. Both in the north and in the south, such customs have been usually explained as "remains of popery." That explanation is no doubt the true one, though I do not use the term "popery" in an invidious sense. The difference between north and south in this matter seems to have been due to the following cause. At the Reformation the Church was robbed of its property to a far greater extent in South Wales than in the north. There were hardly any valuable livings left—for instance, in the diocese of St. David's. Consequently the parishes were served by "humble men of heart," many of whom became Methodists. In the north there were enough rich livings remaining to tempt the cupidity of episcopal families and their friends, and the religious life of the parishes was starved wholesale.

"Rich, self-indulgent, and idle is too much still the character of the clergy of North Wales. The livings are generally good—too good, too rich, to allow any great expectations from such as enjoy them. ... True religion had forsaken the country. There was nothing like the semblance of it in the Church; nor was there much of it among the few dissenters that were very thinly scattered here and there. ... The Bible was almost an unknown book, seldom to be met with, especially in the houses of the poor. In many parishes not even ten could be found capable of reading it, and in several parishes in Anglesea not even two or three." —Morgan's *Life of Rev. T. Charles*, 2nd ed., pp. 236, 249 (1831).

The old Catholic rites, therefore, trailed along the ground, and kept their roots in the soil, with none to attend to them and none to preserve them, by reverent explanation, from degenerating into superstition that was actually indistinguishable from heathenism.

In a succeeding letter (if Iam permitted to write another) I shall enter, in fuller detail, into the North-Walian funeral customs and their real significance.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

III.

London : Dec. 18, 1895.

Nothing has struck me so much in Mr. Hartland's treatment of this question as his absolute ignoring of Christian rites. He quotes [presumably in Perseus?] an account of a funeral custom in Eastern Europe, but he appears to have no notion that every part of the ceremony described can be accounted for by the practice of the Orthodox Church. An account is given of another burial custom in Bavaria, but there are no traces of an inquiry into the history of Catholic rites in that part of the world. Like Wamba's *pax vobiscum*, "Celtic" blood is the key to it all. It is the same in England. Is there a peculiar funeral custom in Derbyshire? Oh, "the population is probably still to a great extent of Celtic ancestry." When we come to Herefordshire and Shropshire, why, we are there right in the Welsh March, which must be saturated with Celticism.

I need not point out that the Early England of that border was, like the rest of England, a pagan country, from which the native Christian population had been scattered in flight to the hills beyond Severn and Wye. Ecclesiastical authorities, both Roman and Anglican, freely acknowledged that heathen customs have always been admitted, within certain limits, into the Christian Church. But so far as I can make out, Mr. Hartland has not set himself the task of tracing the Christian doctrines of atonement, transubstantiation, purgatory, and so on, back to savage origins. It is not the elements of heathenism in Christianity, but the survivals of heathen beliefs and rites in Christian lands outside the church, that he has been looking for. Now the Welsh border is, I admit, a very promising field for such an investigation. Just at that point the "wedge of heathendom," as Green calls it, which had been thrust into the heart of Western Christianity, and had divided it into two unequal parts, was not converted quite so easily as it was further east. Even after the conversion of the pagan English, the innate conservatism of the race would of itself, without other evidence, lead one to expect that many heathen customs would long hold their own in England, in spite of bell, book, and candle. But there is no need to depend on *a priori* reasoning. Direct evidence exists in abundance. In the volume of *Anecdotes and Traditions* edited for the Camden Society by W. J. Thoms there are numerous extracts from Aubrey's *Remaines*, including the well-known ballad formerly used at Yorkshire funerals.

On the stanza —

“From Brig of Dread that thou mayest pass  *Na brader than a thread*,  Every night and awle,  To Purgatory fire thou com’st at last,  And Christ receive thy sawle—"

Thoms has a very interesting note, and a reference to Grimm's *Deutsche Mythologie*, xxi. In fact, he was content to look, in the first place, to Teutonic sources for the ancestry of English beliefs and customs, That was, of course, long before the promulgation of Matthew Arnold's somewhat extravagant theory of the Celtic spirit in English literature. After the spirit, we naturally come to the body; and now we find that at every funeral ceremony, from the Black Sea to the Black Mountain of Wales,

"The trail of the Celt is over them all."

But further, there is the unimpeachable evidence of the laws and canons of the Anglo-Saxon Church. From the days of Wihired of Kent to those of the Norman Conquest we find, for example, references to "diviners and sooth-sayers," "offering to devils," "lyblac," [*Lyb-maleficium, la e-donum*] "lustrations of pagan rites, worshipping idols or heathen gods, the sun, the moon, the fire, [Of. what Mr. Elton (*Origins of English History*) says of the ceremony of passing the "funeral-ale" cup through the fire], rivers, fountains, the elder tree," "the practice of witchcraft," and "exorcism."

I do not think that Mr. Hartland can find evidence of Welsh heathenism, to anything like the same extent, in the pre-Norman annals of the British Church.

The Church has always found it a hard task to keep "the most diligent bishop in all England," as Latimer calls a certain personage, from sowing tares ameng Christian wheat. On this point I beg leave to extract the tenth article of Archbishop Stratford's Constitutions (A.D. 1343). I take it as translated in Johnson of Cranbrook's *Collections* :

"A probable good often becomes an experienced evil, and then an alteration is allowable. It isa devout custom of the faithful to observe night-watches in behalf of the dead before their burial, and to do it sometimes in private houses, to the intent that the faithful there meeting together and watching might devoutly intercede for them with God; but by the arts of Satan this wholesome practice of the ancients is turned into buffoonry and filthy revels; prayers are neglected, and these watchings are become rendezvous for adulteries, fornications, thefts, and other misdoings; as a remedy for so rife a disease, we ordain that when ecclesiastical men have performed the memories (*exsequiae*) of the dead, none for the futura be admitted to the accustomed night-watches at private houses, where dead corpses often remain till their burial, the relations and such as say psalters for the dead only excepted, under pain of the greater ex-communication...."

Of the eleven "comprovincial bishops" present at the publication of this Constitution in St. Paul's, only one was from Wales — namely, David, Bishop of Bangor. "There is superstition," says Bacon, "in avoiding superstition, when men thinke to doe best, if they goe furthest from the superstition formerly received." Our own Reformation affords some notable examples of this.

"In the time of popery," saya Latimer (*Works*, i. 547, Parker Society), "before the Gospel came amongst us, we went to burials with weeping and wailing as though there were no God: but since the Gospel came unto us, I have heard say that in some places they go with the corses grinning and flearing, as though they went to a bear-baiting, which thing no doubt is nought."

From Mr. Edward Peacock’'s notes to his edition of John Myre's "Instructions to the Clergy* (E.E.T.S.) I take the following :

"Chrismatories and fonts were ordered to be kept securely locked, for fear that weak or evil-disposed persons should steal the holy oils or consecrated wafer for magical purposes." "It was customary in early times for the receivers to carry home the *panis benedictus*. It was said that in the fifteenth century some people used to employ it as a charm, and on that account carry it about their persons." "The holy bread, the holy loaf, or *eulogia*, was ordinary leavened bread cut into small pieces, blessed, and given to the people after mass was over."

That copious man, Bishop Bale, in his *Image of the Two Churches*, gives an interesting list of the material adjuncts of worship to which superstition clung. I[have only room here to refer to the "pardon-masers or drinking-dishes." These are, no doubt, of the same origin as the "grace-cups" of Oxford colleges, and the "loving cup" of Guildhall banquets. "These mazers are shallow bowls of wood," says Dr. Rock (*Church of our Fathers*, ii, 340, 341),

"light, thin, and mostly quite black, which sets off the rim and mounting of silver, oftentimes gilt, extremely well. ... Of the several mazer-bowls still in existence, though only a few are indulgenced, all show in the inscription running round the edge a something that speaks of religion. In the vestry of York Cathedral there is a fine one unto which Archbishop Scrope and another bishop had each granted an indulgence of xl. days."

In that most Protestant of all Welsh counties, Cardiganshire, about five miles from Aberystwith, there is the seat of an ancient Welsh family, the Powells of Nanteos. Nanteos is famous through the county for its "healing cup." In *Wales* for November his Honor Judge David Lewis has an interesting paper on this cup. From a couple of cuts illustrating the article, it is evident that the Nanteos healing cup is an old maser-bowl. Unfortunately its former history is not given; and I know not whether the superstition attaching to it is a real survival of Roman Catholic times, or a mere modern revival. The vessel may have been secured by some careful picker-up of such "toys" from the wreckage of the neighbouring abbey of Strata Florida. However that may be, within an easy walk of Nanteos is the Mecca of Welsh Methodism, Llangeitho. For the last hundred years or so, at scores of chapels in that part of Cardiganshire, the bread and wine of Holy Communion have been handed round from one seated partaker to another, with an absence of superstitious formalism that would have satisfied Zwingli himself. And yet all the time this time-worn and mutilated old maser-bowl of Nanteos, which has never, of course, been used in the service of the Mass, but which has possibly been "indulgenced" in olden days, is regarded by the ultra-Protestants of Cardiganshire with superstitious reverence, and as still possessed of healing virtues. From some curious memoranda drawn up by an old butler of Nanteos, and quoted by Judge Lewis, I select one (out of about twenty-five, ranging in date from 1857 to 1889) :

"November 24th, 1887. The Nanteos healing cup was lent on the above date to Charles Eiwards for the use of his daughter, Mary Edwards. One pound left. Returned 13th December, 1887. *A wonderful cure*." The italics are not mine.

Mr. Elton, in his *Origins of English History*, is mistaken when he says that Wirt Sikes had given a full description of the ceremonies connected with the notorious cursing-well of St. Elian, near Denbigh. Wirt Sikes says nothing of the cup.

In *Goleuad Cymru* for May, 1819 (i., pp. 110 *et seq.*), there is a very full account of the trial of one of the "cunning men" (*dynion hyspys*) who exploited that well. Part of the sworn evidence is as follows :

"Then he [i.e., John Edwards, the cunning man] emptied the well with a small wooden cup. When doing so, he prayed to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Then the well filled again. He then filled the cup with water, and asked me to drink some of it, and to throw the rest over my head. He said I must do that three times, and so I did."

It is a well-known North Walian institution to sing improvised verses to the accompaniment of the harp. This is called "Pennillion singing." Hundreds of these rhymes, many of them bearing the marks of considerable age, have been preserved by tradition. A prize was offered at the Denbigh Eisteddfod (1828) for the best collection of *pennillion*. Absalom Roberts won the prize. He subsequently published a small volume of poems (Llanrwst, 1832), in which will be found a further collection of some two hundred stanzas. At the end of the little book the author says that he had gathered

"From place to place, at various times,  More than a thousand ancient rhymes."

The following are the only verses pertinent to this discussion :

"On Shrove-Tide eve a wife I married,  Brief was the time with her I tarried,  Ash-Wednesday morn across the bed  I found her lying stiff and dead ;  Then I offered ’neath her head  A piece of cheese, a loaf of bread,  And of ale a mighty bowl—  May *that* rest upon her soul!"

*Offrymais* is the Welsh word for "offered" in the fifth line. The English and the Welsh are, of course, of the same Latin origin. Unlike the English word, however, the Welsh one is confined strictly to the religious meaning. Cognates are : *offeren* (the service of the Mass), and *offeiriad* (priest), the commonest term for "clergyman" in Welsh, but never applied to Dissenting ministers.

Handing the dole to the poor bedesman across the corpse may perhaps have no meaning beyond that of mere convenience. More probably, however, a deeper meaning was read into the action. Making the sign of the cross lingered on in North Wales till, certainly, the time of John Aubrey. Thus Richard Davies, the Welsh Quaker, says in his autobiography :

"About this time [1658] I went to visit some young men ... two or three of them were convinced ... When we came to the number of four... we determined to meet upon a hill in a common as near as we could, for the convenience of each other. ... There we met in silence, to the wonder of the country. ... We were not free to go into any neighbour's enclosures, for they were so blind, dark, and ignorant that they looked upon us as witches, and would go away from us, some crossing themselves with their hands about their foreheads and faces."

It is only within the last hundred years or so that, broadly speaking, there has been any demand for non-devotional Welsh literature, for it is only within that period that Welshmen who could not read English have been able to read at all. It is rather difficult, therefore, to find any eighteenth century Welsh accounts of Welsh customs. Even during the first half of this century, such reading was looked upon by rigid Methodists as profane, and on the same level as whistling on Sundays or singing *maswedd* (a term applied to all non-spiritual songs, such as the "Men of Harlech" and "Dafydd y Garreg Wen.") And so, almost down to our own day, vernacular accounts of native customs are not common, and when met with they generally turn out to be simply translations from English. The only Welsh account, for instance, of Welsh funerals which Mr. Hartland did not find in my letter to Prof. Rhys—I mean his extract from *Cymru Fu*— has been translated from the Rev. John Evans's *Tour in North Wales* (1804).

I have picked out the following questions from *Goleuad Cymru* for June, 1819, and May, 1821. The answers are mainly "Scripture proofs," and therefore of no folk-lore interest.

"What is the meaning of putting lighted candles in brass candlesticks on the coffin ?"

“Why do people lean on the coffin to pray?"

"Is that a sign of an old custom of praying for the dead?" "The second Sunday after a burial the relations of the deceased keep a 'memorial knell' (*clul coffa*) that Sunday, and feast throughout the day."

"Is it an unseemly and sinful thing for people to drink ale and smoke tobacco at funerals; and whence has that custom sprung?"

Mr. Hartland, strangely enough, left off his quotation from Robert Jones, of Rhoslan, at the very point where the "ritual words" come in. The original proceeds as follows :—

"The whole family on the first Sunday after the burial used to go on their knees on the grave, each saying his Paternoster (*ei Bader*). And they would never mention any deceased member or relative of the family without saying most devoutly 'Heaven be his portion' (*Nefoedd iddo !*)."

And thus we see that the "ritual words" of these "sin-eating" customs can be "shorn off" as ruthlessly by our folk-lorist as by old Father Time himself.

I should like to quote the Rev. W. Bingley's two accounts of the North Wales custom in question— the traditional one as supplied to him most probably by his friend, the Rev. Peter Williams, Vicar of Llanberis; and the actual one as observed and most graphically described by himself. I dare not, however, lay such a burden on the Editor's patience, but must content myself, on my way to Aubrey, with the following :

"When we came to the church we found the place nearly full of people waiting our arrival. The service was read in Welsh in a most impressive manner, and the coffin was let down into the grave by four of the female mourners. A more solemn office I had never witnessed, and the circumstance of the body being committed to the bosom of the eatth by the hands of relatives or friends was altogether new to me. A few rushes were strewed upon the coffin, and I shall never forget the stifled shriek that was uttered when, in Welsh, the solemn words, 'We commit her body to the ground,' &c., were read. ... The ceremony being over, the grave was filled up, and planted with slips of box and some other evergreens. The offerings in the church amounted to near two pounds, of which more than thirty shillings were in silver."

Mr. Hartland has not pointed out in plain terms, as I submit he ought to have done, that only on a single occasion did Aubrey witness personally the funeral ceremonies he describes. That was at Beaumaris, in North Wales. On that occasion the ceremony reminded Aubrey, not of his "own invention" the Sin-eater, but of church funeral offertories or "mortuaries." This custom of mortuaries, once universal in the Church, was kept up in many parts of North Wales until almost the other day. Indeed, no small portion of the North Walian clergy's income used to be derived from that source. But that the custom was a thoroughly English one can be proved at once from the name—"Soulscot," which it bore in the Anglo-Saxon Church. The proper place for its payment, according to the laws of that Church, was "at the open grave."

"Simple astonishment" will best describe my feelings when the custom in North Wales is described as that of "Sin-eating, shorn of the ritual words," and when that custom is asserted to have "certainly existed uncurtailed in the seventeenth century at Llangors." Surely Mr. Hartland does not translate Aubrey's *ipso facto* by "in so many words"? Ithink I am entitled to assume that he has placed before us all the particulars in his possession relative to the "uncurtailed" custom and its "ritual" words. Has he, perchance, perused the will of the woman of Dynder, according to the direction of which, "*nolens volens*" the parson of the parish," her relations had the ceremony in question "punctually performed"? Uncorroborated and unconfirmed, the vague and ambiguous testimony of Aubrey is absolutely worthless. I can find no such term as "Sin-eater" in Sir George Cornewall Lewis's list of Herefordshire words. As Mr. Hartland apparently quotes straight from Mr. Britten’s edition of the *Remaines*, it is no large assumption to suppose that he has read that volume with some care. What are we to say, then, of the candour of his touching expression of confidence in the credibility of John Aubrey, when the following extract of a letter from Ray, the naturalist, to Aubrey himself is to be found in the editor’s preface to that very volume?

"I think (if you can give me leave to be free with you) that you are a little too inclinable to credit strange relations. I have found men that are not skilful in the history of nature very credulous and apt to impose upon themselves and others, and therefore dare not give a firm assent to anything they report upon their own authority, but am ever suspicious that they may either be deceived themselves, or delight to teratalogize (pardon the word), - and to make a show of knowing strange things."

Such is the character of our sole authority for "Sin-eating," so called. It is drawn not behind Aubrey's back by a carping Anthony Wood, but to his own face by a friendly hand.

J. P. OWEN.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Highgarth, Gloucester : Jan. 6, 1896.

I will not venture to emulate Mr. Owen by asserting that *he* has committed blunders; but I would point out: (1) That I read no paper before the British Association—as my letter in the ACADEMY of November 9 shows, I simply spoke in the course of a discussion on cannibalism ; (2) that I have not attempted to prove that the custom of Sin-eating is Celtic, but that there was a custom of the kind in Wales; and (3)that I have not attempted to prove, either in what I said at the British Association or in my letters to the *Times* and the ACADEMY, that the Welsh funeral custom of the *Diodles* "is a mutilated survival of a cannibalistic savage rite formerly practised by the Celts, the central feature of which was eating the corpse." My paper in *Folklore*, published more than three and a half years ago, indeed gave an outline of an argument to this effect, which I have since much amplified and strengthened in the book referred to in the last of my three previous letters to the AcADEMY. My letters to the *Times* and the ACADEMY were merely directed to answering the arguments of Mr. N. W. Thomas and Canon Silvan Evans, to the effect that Sin-eating had never been practised in Wales; and I submit that Mr. Owen has not seriously attempted to controvert my position.

I have forgotten what I admitted in a private letter to Mr. Owen three months ago; but the context of his letter in the ACADEMY of December 7 appears to show that it had reference to the absence of the word "Sin-eater" in Welsh. Now, as this was one of the very arguments of Canon Silvan Evans which I was endeavouring to meet, it is manifest that I did not commit the blunder Mr. Owen alleges of withholding that evidence.

"He is to be congratulated on his capacity for talking round a subject. I shall not follow him in his interesting but discursive remarks, but shall content myself with observations on one or two points. He complains that I have absolutely ignored Christian rites. Quite so ; I was not dealing with the origin, but merely with the fact. When, however, he has mastered in its fuller shape my argument, as to the origin and meaning of the ceremony of Sin-eating, and is prepared to produce in detail the evidence that the Welsh and other customs are part of any Christian ritual, I shall be happy to discuss the question with him at the proper time and place. Meanwhile, I should like to draw his attention to the fact that the customs described by Robert Jones, by Aubrey, and by Pennant, are not apparently connected with any ecclesiastical ritual or Christian doctrine. It is true that they are described in Welsh books written under the influence of the Methodist Revival as relics of Popery. But Robert Jones and his compeers were not scientific students of custom. They simply lumped together as Popish all old customs which they thought to savour of heathenism. Is Mr. Owen a belated follower of that school of thought? It may be conceded that some of the customs described in the *Drych* and else- where were relics of Roman Catholicism. Such is the practice mentioned by Robert Jones, which Mr. Owen censures me for omitting: namely, that of going to the grave on the first Sunday after the funeral, and saying the Paternoster. The reason why I broke off my quotation from the *Drych* was that the subject of the *Diodles* ended where I ended the quotation; and if Mr. Owen will look at the book again he will see that the custom of saying the Paternoster, which he quotes, was practised on a different day (the Sunday after the funeral), at a different place (the grave), and, in short, has nothing to do with the *Diodles*. So much for his charge of shearing off the ritual words.

The condition of Cwmamman, described in Mr. Owen's second letter, is just the condition in which I should expect to find such an institution as Sin-eating. I need not pursue his surmises as to how Mr. Moggridge obtained his information, nor any of his other controversial conjectures. I can tranquilly wait until he has something better to offer. The same remark applies to his various ebullitions of argumentative astonishment. His one point of any importance is that Aubrey's friend, Ray, the naturalist, told him, in a letter which Mr. Owen quotes, that he was "a little too inclinable to credit strange relations." I am not aware whether we have Aubrey's letter to which this is a reply. From the context, however, we may gather that Ray was reproving Aubrey for attaching credit, not to reports of strange customs, but to prodigies of a different kind. Anybody who reads Aubrey's *Miscellanies* will see that the author was (like most of the men of his day) credulous of prodigies, apparitions, and portents; and it is to such as these that Ray, who was a student of nature, referred. But I have yet to learn that that is any reason for discrediting Aubrey when he relates things of a totally different character, wherein the miraculous is no element. In connexion with this, I am glad to find that Mr. Owen agrees with me in thinking that Aubrey actually witnessed the ceremony at Beaumaris; so that there, at all events, his credulity is beside the question.

Before I close, it is right that I should say, with regard to the funeral at Market Drayton (or, rather, at Wollerton, near that town), that, by the kindness of Miss Hope, I have been in communication with her informant, who was present on the occasion, and with the minister. There has been some misapprehension about the incident, and it now seems certain that the wine and biscuits were not handed *across* the coffin, but only given to the bearers and others *in the presence* of the coffin; and that this is the custom in that part of Shropshire. The minister's words also would appear only to have had reference to the general custom of eating and drinking at funerals. But even if the Market Drayton incident and the observation of the minister be erased entirely, the evidence is still abundant for the existence of the practice of Sin-eating and kindred observances in Wales and the Marches during the last two hundred and fifty years.

CORRESPONDENCE.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

London: Jan. 11, 1896.

Mr. Sidney Hartland's doubt as to what "school of thought" I follow may, at any rate, be taken as an indication that I have not thrust my own prejudices and prepossessions into this controversy. That I have "talked round" the subject is a charge that I willingly acknowledge to be true. After reading the previous discussions of the question (including Mr. Elton’s remarks in his *Origins of English History*)— discussions which seemed to me to bring the matter to no satisfactory conclusion, I thought that a few sidelights might probably be an improvement. I am quite satistied with the results obtained so far. I trust that I shall not appear immodest if I avow my belief that the controversy is no longer where it was when Mr. Hartland's letter appeared in the *Times* some few months ago. That gentleman has now denied and conceded quite as much as could fairly be expected of an author who was entirely absorbed in "strengthening" a very untenable theory. But really he is somewhat exacting. After I had presented him with *cwpan y meirw, diodlys*, Robert Jones, Owen Pughe, and Sion Holi the beggarman, he is still waiting "until I have something better to offer." Well, I will not treat him as the workhouse authorities treated Oliver Twist, but will meekly comply with his request.

In one of the volumes of Miscellanies edited by Canon Raines for the Chetham Society is to be found an account of "The State, Civil and Ecclesiastical, of the County of Lancaster, about the year 1590," part of which is as follows :

"XV. Manifolde popishe Superstitions used in the Buriall of the dead.  
"1. Som use the popishe Rites of Buriall towardse the dead Corps at home, as it wer burying it, befor it com to the Churche.  
"2. After that they sett forthe the Corse in theire houses all garnished with Crosses, and sett rownde abowte with Tapers and Candelics burninge night and day till it be carried to the Churche. All whiche time ye neighbors use to visit the Corse, and there everie one to saye (a Pater noster, or De profundis) for the Sole; the Belles (all the while) beinge ronge many a solemn Peale. After which, they are made partakers of the ded manse dowle or Banquet of Charitie.  
"3. Thus all thinges beinge accomplished in right Popishe order at home, at length they carie the Corse towardse the Churche all garnished with Crosses, which they sett downe by the way at everie Crosse, and there all of them devowtly on theire knees make prayers for the dead.  
"., And when in this superstitious sorte they have brought the Corse to the Churche, som with hast prevent the minister, and burie the Corse them selves, becawse they will not be partakers of the service saide at the Buriall ; som, overtreate the minister to omitt the Service, and som times obtagne theire purporse ; and when the minister is redie to accomplishe the order of Service appointed for the Buriall, mavy of these that com with the Corpes will departe ; ffor, Recusantes refuse not to bring it to ye Churche, thoughe they will not partake of the Service of the Churche.  
"5. Then, concerninge those that remain with the Corse till it be buried, when they have sett downe the Corse in the Church, they bende themselves to theire privat prayer with Crossinge and knockinge themselves, All knelinge rownde the Corre neglectinge the publique Service then in hand. And, when the Corse is redie to be putt into the grave ; som, by kissinge the ded Corpes ; other, by wailinge the dead with more than Heathenishe owtcries ; other, with open invocations for the dead; and another sorte with Janglinge the Belles, so disturb the whole action, that the minister is ofte compelled to lett passe that parte of Service appointed for the Buriall of the dead, and to withdrawe him selfe from their tumultuowse Assembly.  
"6. After which Buriall, at theire Banquet in the Alehouse they often times have a 'Pater noster' for the dead.  
"7. All the day and night they use to have excessive ringinge for ye dead, as also at the twelve monethes day after, which they call a minninge day. All which time of Ringinge, theire use is to have theire privat devotions at home for the soule of the dead. ..."

*Quid plura?* It would be insulting the intelligence and abusing the patience of the readers of the ACADEMY to lay before them any more evidence of that kind.

Dogmatism as to the *diodles* having "nothing to do" with the *clul coffa* is surely somewhat premature. Has Mr. Hartland read what Bingley, our earliest authority for the term so far, says about it ?

I have not yet dealt with "M. Jorevin, apparently a Frenchman travelling in England." The writer in question was a M. Jorevin de Rocheford, whose travels were published at Paris in 1672 in three duodecimo volumes. The book does not seem to be at the British Museum ; but the part dealing with the British Isles was translated and given in full in Astle’s *Antiquarian Repertory*, iv., pp. 549-631 (1809). From that translation Owen and Blakeway in their History of Shrewsbury extracted the portion having reference to that town. Mr. Hartland has quoted as a complete sentence what is a mere fragment of one, and has "shorn off" the really "significant" portion. Here follows the complete sentence as printed in the *Antiquarian Repertory*. I have italicised the part omitted by Mr. Hartland :

"It is to be remarked that during this oration there stood upon the coffin a large pot of wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased, *hoping that he might surmount the difficulties he had to encounter in his road to Paradise, where by the mercy of God he was about to enter ; on which mercy they founded all their hope, without considering their evil life, their wicked religion, and that God is just."

M. de Rocheford’s meaning is now plain. He scornfully ridicules the employment by heretics of a rite which had no significance except for those who believed in purgatory and the efficacy of prayers for the dead. Really the portentous gravity with which poor Bagford is dragged in here, and the solemn reference to "an upper stratum of society" are very diverting. I hope that kind of thing is not the prevalent mode among "scientific students of custom."

One word in conclusion in reference to Strabo and Irish cannibalism. Mr. Hartland says (ACADEMY, November 23) that Strabo expressly ascribes to the Irish the custom of eating their dead parents. That statement is wrong, but it is not likely to mislead the readers of the ACADEMY. It is made in a far more misleading manner in the *Legend of Perseus* (ii., p. 281). There it is said that Strabo "admits fairly enough that his authority for the statement is not decisive." What Strabo expressly says is, that his authority for certain specified customs, including the one mentioned above, is not trustworthy. He implies that, as regards cannibalism, he is inclined to believe the tale. But on what grounds? Because, for one thing, it is said to be a Scythian custom also, and because many other nations are said to have practised it amid the rigours of a siege. If Mr. Hartland had consulted the original Greek he could not possibly have so mistaken his author's meaning, for the paragraph is very plain and easy. I am therefore driven to suspect that he has depended on a translation; but an unscholarly translator from Greek is very apt to neglect the force of particles, and (above all) of participial clauses. In fact,

"A participle by the story's brim  
A simple participle is to him,  
And it is nothing more ! "

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Highgarth, Gloucester: Jan. 18, 1896.

One difficulty in arguing with Mr. J. P. Owen arises from the fact that he declines to stick to the point at issue: nay, after being expressly told, he still seems to be unaware what the point is. Let me tell him once more. The question is, whether sin-eating was in effect a Welsh funeral practice. I have shown that the evidence does not rest only on Aubrey's authority, but that customs apparently identical are described by other writers in English and Welsh. And I repeat that Mr. Owen has not seriously attempted to controvert my position. Instead, he wanders away to wedding customs, to the Brig o' Dread, to St. Elian's Well, to pennillion-singing, and to fifty other irrelevant matters. He is so full of throwing "a few sidelights" that he forgets to focus them on the object, and leaves us to grope our way as best we can to his meaning. And then he takes credit that he has "not thrust his own a prejudices and prepossessions into this controversy."

What he appears to mean is that the practices (which he admits took place) were "relics of Popery" — in other words, that they were Christian, and not heathen practices. What then? Does he attempt to distinguish them from the practice, with which we set out, described by Aubrey? Not at all. He contents himself with surmises as to how Mr. Moggridge came by his information, complaints that I have ignored Christian rites, and "simple astonishment"—poor fellow !— at finding the custom in North Wales "described as that of sin-eating shorn of the ritual words." When I try to recall him to the question, he gives a long and interesting quotation from "The State, Civil and Ecclesiastical, of the County of Lancaster, about the year 1590," and says: "It would be insulting the intelligence and abusing to the readers of the ACADEMY to lay before them any more evidence of that kind.” I agree all the more heartily because he gives us no hint how the evidence applies to Wales.

In answer to Mr. Owen's complaint that I had broken off a quotation from Robert Jones at a certain point, I adduced in my last letter reasons to show that the subject of the Diodles ended where I ended my quotation. All he replies is: "Dogmatism as to the *Diodles* having nothing to do with the *clul coffa* is surely premature." Surely it is— but then neither Robert Jones nor I had referred to the *clul coffa*, or memorial knell, which is dragged in by Mr. Owen himself from the *Golewad Cymru*, for what purpose he has yet to show.

Mr. Owen accuses me of omitting a portion of M. Jorevin's account of a funeral at Shrewsbury. I quoted all that was given by Brand and Ellis; for, unfortunately, I had no more access to the original than Mr. Owen himself. But what difference to the argument the rest of the sentence, as he now gives it, would make, he carefully avoids informing us. He seems to think the blessed word "portentous" settles everything— as well it may where "simple astonishment" is reckoned a valid argument.

Lastly, in wandering round the subject, he comes upon my reference to Strabo, and complains that in The Legend of Perseus I have misinterpreted the geographer's expressions. This is an excellent sample of Mr. Owen's "red herring" style of controversy. It may be a very heinous crime to misinterpret Strabo, and I may or may not have been guilty of it. I could easily defend myself if it were necessary to do so here. But my reference to Strabo in the columns of the ACADEMY was a purely incidental one; and I am not going to gratify my friend by running away from the historical question of of sin-eating, and practices identical therewith, in Wales and the Marches to a discussion of cannibalism at large, or even of Irish cannibalism. To discuss these subjects with such a disputant as Mr. Owen would be very entertaining; but it would occupy the rest of my natural life.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

New College, Eastbourne: Feb. 22, 1896.

Now that Mr. Owen has retired from the field to all appearance, you will perhaps allow me, as the person who was directly challenged by Mr. Hartland, and the initiator of the whole discussion, to say a word or two on the question.

The main purpose of my letter in the *Times* was to throw doubt on the Llandebie story, and my doubts rest on a point that has not yet been mentioned in the ACADEMY. In the evidence quoted by Canon Silvan Evans in the ACADEMY in 1878, the schoolmaster of Llandebie stated that cakes were not given at Llandebie. If this is so, it seems to me impossible to suppose that the Sin-eater existed there at the close of the first half of the century, if Mr. Hartland is correct in regarding this dole as a survival and degenerate form of Sin-eating. We cannot suppose that the central rite was in full tide if those portions of the ritual which survive longest in other parts had entirely disappeared.

My second point is, that if Mr. Hartland is correct in identifying all these funeral customs with tribal feasts, he cannot adduce them all as proofs of the existence of the Sin-eater, unless he is prepared to argue that in Wales and the Borders the whole of the tribal ceremonial was swallowed up in the Sin-eating. Unless the custom of tribal feasts underwent a uniform evolution, we should find by the side of any single descendant of it in folk-custom various analogous customs bearing a resemblance more or less close; but these analogous customs cannot be brought forward as a proof of the existence of their co-descendants. We are not entitled to conclude the general practice of Sin-eating from an analogical argument, backed by a few isolated instances on the authority of a single writer, who wrote forty years after the single case which he mentions within the Welsh borders. I say a single writer advisedly, for I cannot regard Mr. Moggridge as an authority: he gives us no hint of his source: we have no certainty that he derived his account at first hand or even at second. I am not enamoured of the anonymous nwspaper correspondent as a collector of folk-lore; but he is better off than Mr. Moggridge's informant, for, if he cannot be identified, he is at least not liable to have his words distorted by transmission and final publication at third, fourth, or fifth hand. Even if we had no denials such as those given by intelligent and competent persons like Mr. Rowlands in 1871, the Llandebie story would rest on an uncertain foundation. In the face of these denials, it seems impossible to give credence to it.

I call attention to the fact that in 1878, though the Sin-eater was said to have existed thirty years previously, no one was produced who had ever seen him, nor even one who had seen a person who had seen him. Thirty years is not so long in a rural district that old customs are forgotten. If the Sin-eater had really existed there in 1850, it would have been possible to find an eye-witness. But no eye-witness was forthcoming.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Highgarth, Gloucester: March 2, 1896

It seems generally that the valley near Llandebie referred to by Mr. Moggridge as the scene of the custom of Sin-eating was Cwmamman. If this be so, the evidence of the schoolmaster of Llandebie (by name John Rowlands) is of little weight. The parish is a very large one. The village, containing the church and the national school, is at one end, the district bordering on Cwmamman at the other. Fifty, or even thirty, years ago the upper part of the parish (towards Cwmamman) was almost a *terra incognita* to the vicar and the schoolmaster. At least, it was beyond their influence; and probably it is so still. I am informed by Mr. J. P. Owen that both the vicar of Llandebie and the schoolmaster mentioned by Canon Silvan Evans were known to him; that they were both strangers to the parish, and that neither of them stayed long enough to identify himself withit. Cwmamman is in the heart of a romantic country. Around it are spots renowned for the hunting of Twrch Trwyth by King Arthur. Across the mountains, only a few miles away, is the famous Van Pool, the dwelling-place of the mysterious lady from whom the physicians of Myddvai traced their descent, and the scene down to a few years ago of an annual summer pilgrimage when the lady herself was expected to appear. The valley was at one time sparsely inhabited. It has been described as "lawless"; it was, doubtless, the very home of superstition. But during the last fifty years a revolution has taken place. Large industries have sprung up, and a considerable population of a much more civilised character been attracted to the place. This revolution was in progress in the sixties; it was completed before Canon Evans's inquiries were set on foot. When we add to all this the fact, to which I have already drawn attention (ACADEMY, November 16, 1895), that those inquiries were not made for more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event, it is hard to see what importance can be attached to the schoolmaster's assertions. He may have been "an intelligent," but he was not a "competent mperson" to give satisfactory evidence ; and it has yet to be proved that his evidence, such as it was, related to a larger area than the village of Llandebie and its immediate surroundings— which do not come into the story at all. This is my reply to Mr. Thomas's first point.

His second point rests, I think, on a misapprehension. I have never identified "all these funeral customs with tribal feasts." What I have contended is, that Sin-eating is a relic of a specific feast of the kin, immediately following a death, at which feast the body of the deceased was eaten. It is therefore unnecessary "to argue that in Wales and the borders the whole of the tribal ceremonial was swallowed up in the Sin-eating." No doubt there were many tribal feasts of various kinds. I do not trace Sin-eating back to them all, nor indeed to any *tribal* feasts. A tribe is a local organisation. The tribe may have included many clans or kindreds ; and, on the other hand, many clans may have stretched far beyond the bounds of the local tribe. It seems to have been the kindred who were entitled and expected to take part in the feast in question. I cannot adequately discuss the matter here, and must be pardoned for referring once more to the chapter on Funeral Rites in the *Legend of Perseus* (vol. ii.) where I have treated the subject in connexion with parallel practices in different parts of the world.

With Mr. Moggridge's sources and opportunities of information I have already dealt (ACADEMY, November 16). I believe his statement. But, even if we leave him out of account, there is enough in Pennant, Robert Jones of Rhoslan, and the Bishop of St. Asaph's MS. to corroborate Aubrey, who besides gives evidence of having curefully inquired into the matter.

Mr. Thomas's last paragraph would be more difficult to meet if it could be shown that Canon Silvan Evans's challenge was brought under the notice of Mr. Moggridge, or anyone else who was interested in the matter and in a position to investigate. But Mr. Moggridge was then an old man; he had left Wales. Canon Evans's contention was probably popular among Welshmen—at least, they were apathetic—and nobody seems to have been concerned to take up the challenge. It is a pity it was so; but this I think we must conclude was the reason why in 1878 (or was it not 1875?) "no one was produced who had ever seen" a Sin-eater.

The Sin-Eater, and Other Tales. By Fiona Macleod. (Edinburgh: Patrick Geddes & Colleagues. )

Miss MACLEOD is the first writer who has tried natively to interpret the Gael, not of the Scottish Highlands, but of the Islands, to Southern readers ; and for sheer originality, other qualities apart, her tales in this volume are as remarkable, perhaps, as anything we have had of the kind since Mr. Kipling appeared. They are so original : in fact, they treat of so strange a subject-matter and in so strange a way, that the unregenerate Saxon may find them at first a little difficult. On a further acquaintance, he will find that their local colour, their idiom, their whole method, combine to produce an effect which may be unaccustomed, but is therefore the more irresistible.

"Why," asks Miss Macleod in her dedicatory epistle to Mr. George Meredith— "why do I write these things? It is because I wish to say to you, and to all who may read this book, that in what I have said lies the secret of the Gael. The beauty of the world, the pathos of life, the gloom, the spiritual glamour: it is out of these, the heritance of the Gael, that I have wrought these tales."

This clearly commits the writer to the romantic method that we find preserved in all these tales, though they have here and there a touch of that realism which romance has never been entirely without — Celtic romance especially. The first of them, "The Sin-Eater," is a capital example in its romantic kind. You feel, in reading it, that the tale-writer has not gone to her subject-matter as a purely disinterested agent. On the contrary, she brings her passionate predilections ; instead of being disinterested, she is perfervidly interested ; she goes prepared to find the things that count, Celtically speaking, and she finds them—the gloom, the spiritual glamour, and the rest. Tomorrow, some New Realist will go over the same ground, and bring back his very different report of things as they really are, and tell us what queer kind of porridge he saw the Achannas eat. But Miss Macleod, being to the manner born, writes from the inside, and not from the outside; is affected through her imagination, and not through her nerves; and is sometimes so carried away by her subject that she forgets how suburban the modern reader is apt to be, and how he likes his sea-lions caged and labelled, and his peat-smoke described in terms of Fleet-street.

Not only does she forget this: she deliberately does all she can to increase the sea terror, the wildness, and the Gaelic savour of her tales. "The Sin-Eater" begins with the wet wind and the sea mist of the western isles; and ends with the wild cry of the man Neil Ross, as he goes down in the "Black Eddy" that rushes between Skerry-Mohr and Skerry-Beag— "An eirig m’ anama!" ("In ransom for my soul!") All through it one hears the sea-noises and feels the sea-wind, and the Sin-eater is treated in bold accord with such elemental circumstance. Half man, half myth, he is the scapegoat of the sea. He bears the sins of others, but with no scapegoat's innocence: therein lies the motive which is treated in this tale with so much force. At last he makes his sea-exit on a spar that is like the cross; nay, in the words of Aulay Macneill, who tells his end, "It *was* the cross he was on. I saw that thing with the fear upon me. Ah, poor drifting wreck that he was. *Judas on the Cross*: it was his *eric*.”

Still more strange, and from an English point of view more simply and artistically constructed and written, is "The Dan-nan-Ron"—perhaps the finest thing in the book. "'You know what is said in the isles about ... about this or that man, who is under *gheasau*. —who is spell-bound,...and... about the seals and... ?' says Marcus Achanna to Anne, the heroine of this strange tale.

"'They say that seals,' he repeated slowly ; 'they say that seals are men under magic spells.'"

Here we have suggested a fine dramatic motive at the threshold of an old Gaelic folk-tale; and Miss Macleod uses her opportunity with singular control of the magic machinery of an uncanny subject. The figure of Gloom Achanna, who plays the tune of the Dan-nan-Ron on his *feadan* (an oaten-pipe or flute), is one not easily forgotten. He lives with unreal reality in one's mind; his wild tunes hold one's ear, though they are described with characteristic Celtic exaggeration by indirection, by colour instead of music, as e.g.:

"Again Gloom took up the *feadan*, and sent a few cold white notes floating through the hot room, breaking suddenly into the wild, fantastic opening air of the Dan-nan-Ron."

A few pages further, and we come upon Manus's song, which, with the description that follows, may be given as an instance of Miss Macleod's writing of both verse and prose :

"The tide was dark an' heavy with the burden that it bore,  
I nae it talkin', whisperin', upon the weedy shore :  
Each wave that stirred the seaweed was like a closing door,  
'Tis closing doors they hear at last who hear no more, no more,  
My grief,  
No more!  


"The white sea-waves were wan and grey, its ashy lips before,  
The yeast within its ravening mouth was red with streamy gore—  
O red seaweed, O red sea-waves, O hollow, baffled roar,  
Since one thou hast, O dark dim sea, why callest thou for more,  
My grief,  For more ?

"In the quiet moonlight the chant, with its long, slow cadences, sung as no other man in the Isles could sing it, sounded sweet and remote beyond words to tell. The glittering shine was upon the water of the haven, and moved in waving lines of fire along the stone ledges. Sometimes a fish rose, and split a ripple of pale gold; or a sea-nettle swam to the surface, and turned its blue or greenish globe of living jelly to the moon dazzle."

There is some excess of mere colour, it may be thought, in all this; but that, too, is very Celtic. And so throughout these tales ; the manner of their telling, their idiom, their very mannerisms, only tend to increase their total effect. To quote again from their teller's singular opening epistle from Iona, addressed to him whom she calls "Prince of Celtdom": they have been written "as by one who repeats with curious insistence a haunting, familiar, yet ever wild and remote air, whose obscure mean- ings he would fain reiterate, interpret." It is only by insisting, as she does, with some romantic excess, on the vivid traits and idioms of the remote Gaelic folk she describes, that she brings home to us their speech, sentiment, and spirit of life, as the true interpreter may. She expressly disavows the documentary method at the start; she is subjective and interpretative to a degree ; she is often so much moved by her own subject matter, that Heine's famous confession of overmuch sentiment in his *Buch le Grand* is apt to recur as one reads. Her tales, then, are not documentary ; they reveal their writer's individuality, quite as much as the idiosyncrasy of the island Gael. But, just for this very reason, they provide as original an entertainment as we are likely to find in this lingering century, and they suggest a new romance as among the potential things in the century to come.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

New College, Eastbourne: March 7, 1896.

With regard to my first point, as Mr. Hartland questions the competence of the schoolmaster, Rowlands, to give satisfactory evidence, it will be convenient if I state what I believe to be the facts with regard to his position. I am obliged, unfortunately, to speak from memory, so I trust Mr. Hartland will be merciful if he finds me tripping. Mr. Rowlands's own statements are: (1) that he became schoolmaster at Llandebie in 1852, the year of the Ludlow meeting—if, as I suppose, he was schoolmaster there when Canon Evans wrote, Mr. Owen's recollection seems to be at fault ; (2) that he was in the habit of attending funerals; (3) that he collected for Sir Thomas Phillipps the traditions and customs of the district. He has also, I believe, published a pamphlet on some Welsh archaeological question. He was therefore, before Canon Evans applied to him, taking an interest in matters of this sort. Of course, if he had no acquaintance with a larger area than the immediate surroundings of Llandebie, his evidence is only valuable for that area ; but Mr. Hartland (ACADEMY, November 9) stated that the ritual was in use "at Llandebie." I admit that if Mr. Hartland's assumption as to the extent of Mr. Rowlands's knowledge be correct, the value I attach to his evidence is unwarranted ; but Mr. Hartland must also admit that it is his change of ground which renders it so. If, however, he was employed by Sir Thomas Phillipps for the purpose stated, I infer that his knowledge extended to more than the immediate surroundings of Llandebie.

I offer apologies for not having stated my second point more clearly. It is this. Mr. Hartland regards Sin-eating as a survival of a specific feast of the kin ; he as survivals of Sin-eating customs of eating and drinking at funerals where we find no Sin-eater and no special virtue attributed to the dole. I suggest that these customs are allied to Sin-eating in virtue of a common descent from the feast of the kindred, not by direct descent from Sin- ating itself. I suppose that the feast of the kindred is now represented by various practices— A, B, C. Evidence shows that these were occasionally associated with or replaced by D. No amount of evidence that A, B, and C were, or are, generally practised will lead to the conclusion that D was prevalent in the area in question. I contend that we find certain customs involving the giving of food at funerals. There is evidence that these customs sometimes took the form of Sin-eating, but we cannot infer the existence of Sin-eating wherever we find these offertories at funerals. And be it noted in this connexion that Aubrey himself does not connect the offertories with the Sin-eater.

As to the third point, I do not agree with Mr, Hartland that no one was concerned to take up the challenge. The ACADEMY controversy arose out of an article in *Blackwood*. The writer (Prebendary Davies of Hereford, according to a good authority) professed to be well acquainted with Wales, and having taken up the challenge, was certainly interested in the matter, and, I think, in a position to investigate.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Highgarth, Gloucester: March 14, 1896.

I must plead guilty to having given Mr. Thomas some reason for charging me with changing my ground. Mr. Moggridge, it seems, did not specify the exact place where the custom of Sin-eating had been performed within recent years. He described it as a mountain valley near Llandebie. Writing without having the *Archaeologia Cumbrensis* before me, but only notes of its contents, I referred to the scene in general terms as "at Llandebie." Nor have I there the letter containing Mr. Rowlands's statements. But, assuming Mr. Thomas's account of them to be correct, I see nothing in them to alter my opinion. It was, at all events, some years after the event signalised by Mr. Moggridge that Mr. Rowlands came to the village of Lilandebie; and, granting that Cwmamman was where the custom was alleged to have been practised, it appears to me that Mr. Rowland's denials so many years later cannot outweigh Mr. Moggridge's affirmation. However, I am unable to carry the evidence further, and there for the present it must rest.

If I now understand Mr. Thomas's second point —that the customs of North Wales described by Pennant, Robert Jones, and Aubrey himself were not survivals of Sin-eating, but merely independent survivals of the same feast, of which the custom of Sin-eating was also a survival—he admits that the custom of Sin-eating was practised somewhere, It is, of course, extremely difficult, if not impossible, to say with certainty whether these North Welsh customs were lineally descended from that of Sin-eating, or were only variant or related forms of it, independently derived from a common original. In my view the whole evidence presented in this correspondence—not forgetting the Lancashire custom of "The ded manse dowle or Banquet of Charitie," brought to light by Mr. Owen—points to a widespread, and probably Celtic, custom of Sin-eating, gradually disappearing with the growth of civilisation, and surviving here and there in more or less complete forms, which were naturally not all precisely alike. The difference between us is, after all, no very great one, and the scientific inferences as to the meaning of the customs remain undisturbed.

Whoever the writer of the article in Blackwood's may have been, what evidence is there that Canon Silvan Evans's letters in the ACADEMY were brought to his knowledge? In any case, the article was most likely nothing more than a pot-boiler, in which, having served its office, the author had no further concern. The manners and customs of the tribe of magazine article-writers are well known. Mr. Owen gave an amusing and instructive example in his letter which appeared in the ACADEMY of December 21. Everybody who has made it his business to inquire seriously into any subject could easily add others quite as amusing and almost as instructive.

Here, so far as I am concerned, I must bring the correspondence to a close. The subject, I think, has been pretty well threshed out. In thanking the Editor of the ACADEMY for allowing the statements of fact and exchange of opinions in his columns, I may venture to express the hope that, if his correspondents have not succeeded in converting one another, they have at least provided some material not without value for the solution of the questions involved.

THE SIN EATER IN WALES



THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

New College, Eastbourne: March 91, 1896. I should not offer any remarks on Mr. Hartland's last letter, if it were not that he has admitted the importance of my point, that no direct evidence was produced in reply to Canon Silvan Evans's challenge, and at the same time misunderstood my statement that the *Blackwood* writer took up the challenge. He was actually one of the correspondents in the ACADEMY; so of course, Mr. Hartland's remarks have no bearing on the point at issue. If most articles are potboilers, and of no further concern to the writers, this was certainly not the case on the occasion under discussion.

I base my suggestion that some at least of the customs are independent survivals partly on the fact that we find in some cases *all* the guests expected to partake.

N. W. Thomas.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. London: April 8, 1898.
My only excuse for writing again on this subject in the AcApEMY is the belief that I have now run the Welsh “ Sin-eater ” to earth, and that, too, in the very parish understood to have been referred to by Moggridge at Ludlow.
In 1844, Miss Anne Beale, the well-known writer of numerous tales and novels depicting various phases of life in Wales, published a small volume of sketches under the name of The Vale of the Towey. At that date Miss Beale was governess to the daughters of Mr. Williams, vicar of Llandefeisant, a small parish almost entirely swallowed up by Dynevor Park, where the church is situated. Practically, Liandefeisant may be looked upon as belonging to the parish of Llandilo; and, in the early forties, the southern end of that huge parish included a great portion of the ‘lawless mountain valley ” of Cwmamman.
The sketches of Welsh manners and customs to be found in The Vale of the Towey are drawn from life, a little idealised, no doubt, but, apart from the slender thread of fiction on which they are strung, absolutely trustworthy. They were republished, I should add, by the Religious Tract Society in 1886, with the title altered into Seven Years for Rachel.
So much being premised, I now proceed to give a few extracts from the fourteenth sketch, which is named “ The Ivorite’s Funeral” :
** Pally is accordingly busily engaged in serving out a beverage that was once common at funerals, but is now comparatively seldom used. It is called abeilon, and is composed of the juice of the elderberry, rosemary, and other herbs, well spiced, and poured into hot ale, which is dis- tributed to the mourners, and drunk, notwith- standing the circumstances, with evident satis-
action. All the assembly .. . . partake of the reeking drink, eat cake with it, and talk meanwhile of many things far removed from the solemn subject of death, though it would seem impossible to forget it in the presence of the corpse. When the party had drunk a sufficient quantity of abeilon, one of them, a tall, lank man, arose. . . . This was the Dissenting minister. . . . After quietly delivering the text, he pours forth at once a flood of words. . . . He then gives out a verse of a hymn, in which most of his congregation join. . . . The hymn being finished, the minister descends from his pulpit, and again enters the house. He is immediately attended by Rachel’s uncle and Pally, the former of whom slips five shillings into his hand in pay- ment for his sermon, whilst the latter offers a second glass of abeilon. Both are received with thanks . . and the preacher takes his depar- ture. . . . The preparations for bearing the body to its last resting-place now began. . . . At the turning of the lane another procession was seen approaching in an opposite direction. It was composed of the members of the Ivorite Olub, consisting of between two and three hundred persons, who joined the funeral, and preceded the coffin. Each individual wore a black scarf and hatband, and the general effect was very imposing. They wound their mournful way through the park until they reached the little church I have already attempted to describe. There they were met by the clergyman, and the solemn service began. The coffin rests in the aisle, and the church is filled with mourners. The first part of the service over, they proceed to the churchyard and surround the grave. . . . The sunbeams fall upon the dark forms of the mourners, and rest upon the coffin. . . . A few lumps of earth fall heavily upon the coffin. . . . The Ivorites now surround the grave. Hand in hand they encircle it, whilst each takes from his bosom a spric of rosemary and drops it upon the coffin. The last act completed, they stand for a few moments solemnly silent, then disunite and form into pairs.’’
Moggridge, itmay be remembered, in his letter to Canon Silvan Evans (January 1, 1876), said that the only written account of the custom mentioned by him at Ludlow was Aubrey’s. If, therefore, somebody who had read the above account in Miss Beale’s book had told him of the “tall lank man” who poured forth ‘‘ a flood of words,” received ‘‘ five shillings,” drank a glass of abeilon, and then departed—all this “ritual” being quite distinct from the church service ; or if, which is still more probable, he had heard the tale, with inevitabie variations, at third or fourth hand, he may be excused for having seen in it a confirmation of Aubrey’s fable of the Sin-eater.
The term abeilon, which is italicised in the republished sketch but not in the original one, is unknown tome. Itisnot to be found, nor anything like it, either in Owen Pughe’s Dic- tionary or in Silvan Evans’s. If the initial, however, is the definite article ‘‘y,” then we have (I now quote from Lewis’s Welsh Dictionary, 1805), meiliaid, “‘a dishful,” “a bowlful” ; meiliedyn, “as bowl” ; meilio, “to put in a bowl,” “to dish”; meilon, “‘powder,” ‘“‘dust,” “flour”; meiloni, ‘‘to reduce to powder,” ‘‘to become dust”; mail, ** a hollow vessel of wood; a vessel to hold milk; a bowl or basin.”
May I, in conclusion, make an ingenuous confession? I was a leetle disappointed at finding this meilio derivation; for before I came upon it I had constructed a very pretty theory, by conjecturing that it was a form of ymbilion (‘‘ earnest entreaties,’’) degraded and disguised beyond recognition.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. Cardiff April 27, 1996.
Mr. J. P. Owen, writing under the above heading in the ACADEMY of April 25, seems to have mistaken the true meaning and etymology of abeilon, a term used in the neighbourhood of Llandilo, in Carmarthenshire. The a, prob- ably, as Mr. Owen suggests, represents the article ; but the word is composed of y bylon or y mylon, literally ‘‘edges” or ‘‘ margins,” and then ‘‘ perquisites” or “‘ gifts.” The bylon of which Miss Beall speaks were the customary perquisites given in the neighbourhood of Llandefeisant, and are still in vogue in some parts of Wales. The term is used in other parts of Carmarthenshire, and also in North Wales. It is the plural form of byl or myl, ‘ side,” ‘* edge,” or ‘‘ margin,’ and still heard in the phrase hyd y fyl, ‘‘to the brim,” or “ brimful.” It is a good word, and should have found place in every Welsh dictionary ; and it is somewhat strange that Chancellor Silvan Evans has not included it in his great work. Both forms, bylon and mylon, are heard in the neighbour- hood of Newcastle Emlyn, a locality with which the Chancellor is well acquainted.

Permit me to correct an error into which Mr. W. Eilir Evans has fallen, in his letter in the ACADEMY of May 2, regarding the word by/.
He there states that ‘‘ it is somewhat strange that Chancellor Silvan-Evans has not included it [dy/j] in his great work.” The word is included in the dictionary referred to, and will be found, together with the phrase ‘‘llawn hyd y fyl,’’ in its alphabetical order on p. 600.
HEnryY SILVAN-EVANS.
[In justice to Mr. Silvan-Evans, we ought to say that the assertion he contradicts seems to have arisen from a misunderstanding. It was a former correspondent (Mr. J. P. Owen, in the ACADEMY of April 25) who affirmed that the (anglicised) Welsh word abei/on was not to be found in Silvan-Evans’s Welsh Dictionary. Mr. W. Eilir Evans, while supplying tbe real Welsh form by/, appear to have supposed that Mr. Owen’s assertion extended likewise to that.—Ed. ACADEMY. |

The dissyllabic compound ymy/ is the ordinary Welsh word for “brim,” “edge,” &. In Carmarthenshire that word is pronounced imi!, the vowel in both syllables having the same. value as in the English word “limit.” The Irish and Gaelic cognates are imaell and iomall. In Cardiganshire and North Wales the vowel has a different sound, which the u of the English word ‘‘humble”’ will represent well enough. I cannot at present see my way to concede that Miss Beale’s abei/on has anything to do with ymy/ and its plural form ymylon, or with the very dubious variants y bylon and y mylon given by Mr. Eilir Evans. I cannot find myl as an independent word in the dic- tionaries; and this is what they say about its brother byl.
Owen Pughe’s Dictionary’, 1832:
** Byl, sm. pl. t. au (yl), a brim or edge. Yn llawn hyd y byl, being full to the brim, Sil[-urian]. This word is only used in North Wales in its com- pound forms, ymy/, cyfy/, and the like.”’
Silvan Evans’s English - Welsh Dictionary (1858) has, under ‘‘ brimless,” “‘ a heart brimful of tears,” calon lawn o ddagrau hyd y byl.” The same distinguished lexicographer’s Welsh- English Dictionary has (p. 600) :
‘*Byl (¥), sm. f.,a brim oredge; a rim. Liawn hyd y fyl, full to the brim, brimful. S[-outh} Wi-ales{.”
But Mr. Eilir Evans says that y bylon and mylon not only mean ‘‘ edges ”’ or “‘ margins,” ut also ‘‘ perquisites” or “ gifts.” In regard to that statement I have collected the following evidence. Under ‘‘ perquisite,”’ I find in Silvan Evans’s English- Welsh Dictionary, ad/ael, dam- weinfael, dygwyddfael, rhoddfael, mael dygwydd, rhyw fael neu elw a gaffer heb law cyflog [* some vail or profit that is got in addition to wages”), anrheg. Under ‘‘ vails” the same work gives gweinidfael, gweinidrodd, damweinfael, rhodd- Jfael, ystlysfael, mael dygwydd, rhodd i weini- dogion [‘‘ gift to ministers”). Salesbury has mael, “‘avayle”; T. Richards (1753) has mael, “gain, profit, lucre, advantage”; T. Lewis (1805) has ‘‘ maelor, s., a place of traffic, a mart or market. There are districts so called in the marches of Wales, which were neutral ground, where trade was carried on.” It is clear, from the above quotations, that the question is not confined to ymylon and y meilon, but that maelon must also be taken into account. Both mail and mael will explain the diph- thongal middle syllable of abeilon, but ymy? will not. Whether or no the Welsh mae/ is connected i i English ‘“ mail” (in “ black- mail”) or English ‘‘ vails” is an interesting problem, but (mindful of the heading of this note) I must not attempt to discuss it at
present. J. P. Owen.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES—A POSTSCRIPT.
London: May 16, 1896. In the AcADEMY for November 23, 1893 (p. 485), Mr. Sidney Hartland has a remark which led me to suppose that diodliffé is not found in the Welsh dictionaries before the Trefriw (1815) edition of Richards’ work. As a matter of fact, the word is to be found in the first edition (Bristol, 1753). Moreover, what Richards says is taken from Lluyd’s Archaeo- logia Britannica (1707). In that most excellent and valuable work, there is a division containing Welsh words, omitted in Dr. Davies of Mall- wyd’s Dictionary (1632), among them being ‘** Additions written by Dr. Davies himself
in the margin of his Dictionary.” One of these is ‘ Diodlift, Kuppan dros y Meiru.” These additions are the ‘“ MS. notes” to’ which Mr. Hartland refers. There is also a very enlightening note on byl in this division of Lluyd’s folio: ‘ Bil, ‘the mouth’; hence in i hire and elsewhere Bil is the mouth of a vessel. ‘ Kuppan laun hyd y vyl,’ &c.” Lower down is found “‘[Obsol. Welsh] Bill, ‘a mouth,’ Ir. Béul, [Obsol. Ir.] Bél.” (1 should explain that Lluyd writes u for w.)
May I just add a line with reference to Mr. Joseph Jacobs’s careful note to the Cornish “Tale of Ivan” in his Celtic Fairy Tales? Mr. Jacobs does not seem to have been aware that that fine story is printed (with due acknowledgment that it is taken from Lluyd’s Archaeologia) in Trysorfa Gwybodaeth (Car- marthen, 1770). The proverbial saying quoted in Borrow’s Wild Wales may probably be thus accounted for.
