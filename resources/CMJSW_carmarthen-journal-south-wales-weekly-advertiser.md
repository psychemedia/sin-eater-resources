Notes of the Week

It is stated that the sin eater survived at Cwmamman in Carmarthenshire within recent times. The last of the ilk is said to have been a hermit, who dwelt, in a cave, and who spoke with no one. Outside his cave there was a bell which was rung whenever the sin eater's services were required. A messenger would tell him that a certain person was dying, whereupon the sin eater hastened to the death chamber, which would be deserted by all the friends of the dying before his arrival. Here he would find a plate on the death bed, the contents of which the sin eater devoured; and after pocketing the coin which was also placed on the plate he would disappear before any members of the family saw him.
