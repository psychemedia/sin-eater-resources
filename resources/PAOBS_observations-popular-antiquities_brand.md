OBSERVATIONS ON CHAPTER III.

...

We farther learn from this Ritualist [Durant? Duranti de Rhibus p~227?], that it was customary to invite the *Poor* [1] to Funerals.

I find a beautiful Thought on this Subjeftf [2], in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durant, which I flatter myself will be thought to have deserved a tranflation:— "The *Poor* also shed their Tears — precious and fruitful Tears! that washed away the Sins of the Deceased.— They let fall Floods of redeeming Tears."

Funeral Sermons also are of great Antiquity.

Doles were used at Funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostoms, to procure Rest to the Soul of the Deceased, and that he might find his Judge propitious.

[1] Praeterea convocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacerdotes et Religiosi, sed et *Egeni Pauperes*. Had our famous Poet, Mr. *Pope*, an eye to this in ordering, by Will, poor Men to support his Pall ?

[2] Mr. Strutt in his Englisg Aera tells us, that Sir Robert Knolles (in the 8th Year of Henry IV.) died at his Manor in Norfolk and his dead Body was brought in a Litter to London with great Pomp and much Torch Light, and it was buried in the White Friars Church — "where was done for him a solemne Obsequie, with a great Feast and *lyberall Dole to the Poore.*" This Custom of giving a Funeral Feast to the Chief Mourners, was universally practised all over the Kingdom, as well *as giving Alms to the Poor*, in Proportion to the Quality and Finances of the Deceased.

Chapter II 

Of Watching the Dead

Watching with the Corps was an antient Custom of the Church, and every where practised. They were wont to sit by it, from the Time of its Death till its Exportation to the Grave, either in the House it died in, or in the Church itself. Agreeable to this, we read in St. Austin, That as they watched his Mother Monica `[Psaltenum arripuit Euodius, & cantare caepit psalmum, cui respondebamus omnes domus: Miserecordiam & judicium cantabo tibi Domine. Aug. Lib. 9. Confes C. 12.]` Euodius took the Psaltery and began to sing a Psalm which the whole Family answered with that of the Psalmist David, I will sing of Mercy and Judgement unto thee, LORD, I will sing. And we are told, `[Ad ecclesiam antelueana hora qua defunctus est, corpus ipsius portatum est: ibique eadem suit nocte, quam vigilaviamus in pascha. Gmg. Turon. de Gloria; Confes. C. 104.]` That at the Death of St. Ambrose, his Body was carried into the Church before Day, the same Hour he died. It was the Night before Easter and they watched with him there.

How unlike to this antient Custom of watching is the modern one, of locking up the Corps in a Room, and leaving It there alone? How unlike to this decent Manner of watching, is that watching of the Vulgar, which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdness? Watching at that Time with a dear Friend, is the las Kindness and Respect we can shew him; and how unfriendly is it, to change it into Negligence and too great Resignation? How unchristian, instead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity, to put on an unbecoming Joy and undecent Pastime,



p21-2
Our Author, for what Reason I know not, has omitted the vulgar Name given here to this *watching with a Corps*. It is called the *Lake-wake*; a Word plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon Lie or Lice, *a Corpse* and *a Wake*, a *Vigil*, or *Watching*. It is used in this Sense by Chaucer, in his Knight's Tale :

Shall not be told for me.  
How that Arcite is brent to Afhen cold,  
Ne how that there the *Liche-wake* was yhold  
All that Night long.

Thus also I read in the Article *Walkin* in the learned `[* By the late Mr. Ruddiman, as is generally supposed.]` Glossary to Douglas' Virgil, "Properly *Like-wakes* (Scotch) are the Meetings of the Friends of the Deceased, a Night, or Nights before the Burial."

I am not satisfied with either of the Quotations he has given us in Proof of the Antiquity of the Custom: They are indeed something to the Purpose; but in the last cited Passage, one would be inclined to think from the Words of the Original, that the *Watching* was on Account of its being the Vigil of Easter-Day.

The subsequent Extract from one of the antient Councils quoted in Durant, `[Porro observandum est, nedum Psalmos cani confuetum, cum fucus ducitur, sed etiam nocte, que praecedit funus, veteres vigilasse, nocturnasque vigilias canendis Psalmis egisse.]` p. 232, is, I think, much more apposite: — "Now it must be observed, that Psalms are wont to be sung not only when the Corps is conducted to Church, but that the Antients *watched on the Night* before the Burial, and spent the Vigil in singing Psalms." So also *Gregory*, in the Epistle that treats of the Death of his Sister Macrina, has these Words: `[Cum igitur (inquit) nocturna pervigilatio, ut in Martyrum celebritate canendis Psalmis perfecta esset & Crepusculmn advenisset &c. Durant, p. 232.]` "Now when the *nightly Watching*, as is usual" &c.

I could give numerous Passages from the Antients, were there any Doubt of the Antiquity of a Custom, which probably owes its Origin to the tenderest *Affections* of human Nature, and has perhaps on that Account been used from the Infancy of Time.


p23 chapter II - this is borune ratehr than observatio?

I find in Durant a pretty exact Account of some of the Ceremonies used at present in what we call *laying out* or *streeking* `[*To Streek*, to expand, or stretch out. from the Anglo-Saxon SlCJiecaBy. extendere. See Benson's Anglo-Saxon Vocabulary in verbo.— A *Streeking-Board* is that on which they stretch out and compose the Limbs of the dead Body.]` in the North

````FOOTNOTE: Quinetiam Sanctorum Corpora, manibus erestis supinisque excipere – occludere oculos-— ora obturare — decenter ornare–  lavare accurate et linteo funebri involvere, &c.

Durant. de Ritibus, p. 224.

Mr. Pennant, in his Tour in Scotland, tells us, that on the Death of a Highlander, the Corps being *stretched* on a *Board*, and covered with a coarse *Linen Wrapper*, the Friends lay on the Breast of the Deceased a *wooden* Platter, containing a small Quantity of *Salt* and *Earth*, separate and unmixed; the *Earth* an Emblem of the corruptible Body; the *Salt* an Emblem of the immortal Spirit.— All Fire is extinguished where a Corps is kept; and it is reckoned so ominous for a Dog or a Cat to pass over it, that the poor Animal is killed without Mercy.
````

Mention is made of the closing the Eyes and Lips —the decent washiing — dressing — and wrapping in a Linen Shroud `[The Face Cloth too is of great Antiquity.— Mr Strutt tells us, that after the closing the Eyes, &c. a Linen Cloth was put over the Face oi the Deceased.— Thus we are told, that Henry the Fourth, in his last Illness seeming to be dead, his Chamberlain Covered his Face with a Linen Cloth. English AEra, p. 105]` Of which Shroud Prudentius, the Christian Poet, has these Words:

Condore nitentia claro 
Praetendere lintea mos est. 
— Hymn. ad Exequias Defunct.

The Interests of our Woollen Manufactories have interfered with this antient Rite in England.

It is customary at this Day in Northumberland, to set a Pewter *Plate*, containing a little *Salt* `[Salem abhorrere constat Diabolu, et ratione optima nititur, quia Salr aeternitatis est et immortatalitatis signum, neque putredeine neque corruptione infestatur unquam, sed ipse ab his omnia vendicat. Depriv. Rel. &c. p154. Confided in reference to this symbolical Explication, how beuatiful is that Expression, "Ye are the Salt of the Earth."]` upon the Corps; as also a Candle in some Places. — The learned Moresin tells us, "That *Salt* is the Emblem of Eternity and Immortality: It is not liable to Putrefaction itself, and it preserves Things that are seasoned with it from Decay." — He gives us also his Conjecture on the Use of a *Candle* `[Lucerna, feu Candela mortuis cadaveribus semper apponitur in domibus et templis, quamdiu fspra terram sunt— aa hinc ducto more, oculo, vel Lucerna incensa veteres AEgyptii vitam significabant, unde veteres foliti sunt lucernas ardentes sepulchris imponere, hac saltem ratione significantes se mortuorum quamdiu possent vitas producturos. Deprav. Rel. Orig. p. 89.]` on this Occasion: "It was an Egyptian Hieroglyphic for Life, meant to express the ardent Desire of having had the life of the Deceased prolonged."

SIN EATERS

The following is extracted from Mr. Bagford's Letter relating to the Antiquities of London, printed in the first volume of Leland's Collectanea, p. lxxvi. It is dated Feb. 1, 1714-5.

"Within the memory of our Fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire, (for so they called him,) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket; a Crust of Bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of Ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this, he got up from the Cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, *the ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul*. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq. who made a Collection of curious Observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. How can a Man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient Heathens?"

[Aubrey's Collection, here mentioned, was most probably the "Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism," still preserved among the Lansdowne Manuscripts in the British Museum; whence the following remarks on this subject, in Mr. Aubrey's own hand, have been extracted.

"In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at Funeralls to hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them, (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskal,) I remember lived in a Cottage on Rosse high-way. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the House, and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of Bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle, of Maple, full of Beer, (which he was to drink up,) and Sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old Lawe, Levit. chap, xvi. v. 21, 22. 'And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the Wilderness. And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited: and he shall let the Goat goe into the Wilderness.'

"This Custome, (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder, (volens nolens the Parson of the Parish,) the kindred of a Woman deceased there had this Ceremonie punctually performed, according to her Will: and, also, the like was done at the City of Hereford in those times, where a Woman kept, many yeares before her death, a Mazard Bowle for the Sinne-Eater; and the like in other places in this Countie: as also in Brecon ["E.g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the Minister, about 1640. could not hinder the performance of this ancient Custome."]. I believe this Custom was heretofore used all over Wales.

[MS. Lansd. 226. fol. 116. In another page, Mr. Aubrey says: "A. D. 1686. This Custom is used to this day in North Wales :" where Milk seems to have been the substitute for Beer.

Bishop Kennet, in whose possession Aubrey's Manuscript appears to have been, has added this Note. "It seems a remainder of this Custom which lately obtained at Amersden in the County of Oxford, where at the burial of every Corpse, one Cake and one Flaggon of Ale, just after the interment, were brought to the Minister in the Church Porch."]

"In North Wales," says Mr. Pennant's MS. to often quoted in the former Volume of this Work, (speaking of the Manners of the eighteenth Century,) "the Night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the House the corpse is in, each bringing with him some small present of Bread, Meat, Drink, (if the family be something poor ;) but more especially Candles, whatever the Family be: and this Night is called *wyl nôs*, whereby the country people seem to mean a Watching Night. Their going to such a House, they say is, *i wilior corph*, i. e. to watch the corpse; but *wylo* signifies to weep and lament, and so wyl nôs may be a night of lamentation: while they stay together on that night they are either singing Psalms, or reading some part of the Holy Scriptures.

"Whenever any body comes into a Room where a dead Body lies, especially the wyl nôs and the day of its Interment, the first thing he does, he falls on his knees by the Corps, and says the Lord's Prayer."

p146 Salt upon the body, and candle

Corpse candle https://archive.org/details/observationsonpo02branuoft/page/548/mode/2up?q=corpse p549-50
Corpse Candles, says Grose, are very common appearances in the Counties of Cardigan, Caermarthen, and Pembroke, and also in some other parts of Wales: they are called Candles, from their resemblance not of the body of the Candle, but the fire; because that fire says the honest Welchman, Mr. Davis, in a Letter to Mr. Baxter, doth as much resemble material Candle Lights, as Eggs do Eggs: saving that, in their Journey, these Candles are sometimes vi- sible and sometimes disappeared, especially if any one comes near to them, or in the way to meet them. On these occasions they vanish, but presently appear again behind the Observer and hold on their course. If a little Candle is seen, of a pale bluish colour, then follows the Corpse, either of an Abortive, or some Infant: if a larger one, then the Corpse of some one come to age. If there be seen two, three, or more, of different sizes, some big, some small, then shall so many Corpses pass together and of such ages or degrees. If two Candles come from different places, and be seen to meet, the Corpses will do the same; and if any of these Candles be seen to turn aside, through some by-path, leading to the Church, the following Corpse will be found to take exactly the same way. Sometimes these Candles point out the places where persons shall sicken and die. They have also appeared on the bellies of pregnant women, previous to their delivery; and predicted the drowning of persons passing a Ford. Another kind of fiery Apparition peculiar to Wales, is, what is called the Tan- we or Tan- wed. This appeareth, says Mr. Davis, to our seeming, in the lower region of the air, straight and long, not much unlike a Glaive, mours or shoots directly and level, (as who should say I'll hit) but far more slowly than falling Stars. It light eneth all the Air and Ground where it passeth, lasteth three or four miles or more, for aught is known, because no man seeth the rising or beginning of it; and when it falls to the ground, it sparkleth and lighteth all about. These commonly announce the death or decease of Freeholders by falling on their Lands; and yon shall scarce bury any such with us, says Mr. Davis, be he but a Lord of a House and Garden, but you shall find some one at his burial that hath .seen this Fire fall on some part of his Lands.
Sometimes these Appearances have been seen by the persons whose death they foretold: two instances of which Mr. Davis records as having happened in his own Family [ See Aubrey's Miscellanies, p. 176. Baxter's World of Spirits, p. 131 — 137.
Bishop Hall, in his Characters of Vertues and Vices, speaking of the Superstitious Man, says: "Some wayes he will not go, and some he dares not; either there are Bugs, or he faineth them. Every Lanterne is a Ghost, and every noise is of Chaines. He knowes not why, but his Custom is to go a little about, and to leave the Crosse still on the right hand."
In the Cambrian Register, Svo. 1796. p. 431. we read: "That, among the lower Class of People, there is a general belief in the existence of Apparitions, is unquestionable: but as to the lighted Candle springing up upon the errand of Love, I believe that no person in Wales has ever before heard of it: (the Author is remarking on Pratt's Gleaner) the Traveller has probably confounded it with a very commonly-received opinion, that within the Diocese of St. David's, a short space before Death, a Light is seen proceeding from the House, and sometimes, as lias been asserted, from the very Bed where the sick person lies, and pursues its way to the Church where he or she is to be interred, precisely in the same track in which the Funeral is afterwards to follow. This Light is called Canwyll Corpt, or the Corpse Candle."]

AllHallow Even

In North Wales (Mr. Pennant's MS. informs me) there is a custom upon All Saints Eve of making a great fire called CoelCoeth, when every family about an hour in the night makes a great bonfire in the most conspicuous place near the house, and when the fire is almost extinguished, every one throws a white stone into the ashes, having first marked it, then having said their prayers turning round the fire, they go to bed. In the morning, as soon as they are up, they come to search out the stones, and if any one of them is found wanting they have a notion that the person who threw it in will die before he sees another All Saints Eve.

They have a custom also of distributing Soul Cakes on All Souls Day, at the receiving of which poor people pray to God to bless the next crop of wheat.

There is a general observation added: "N. B. 1735. Most of the harmless old customs in this MS. are now disused."

...

In the Festyvall, fol. 1511, fol. 149 b. is the following passage: "We rede in olde tyme good people wolde on All haloween daye *bake brade* and dele it for all crysten soules."

I find the following, which is much to my purpose, in "Festa Anglo-Romana," p. 109. All Souls Day, Nov. 2d. "The custom of *Soul Mass Cakes*, which are a kind of Oat Cakes, that some of the richer sorts of persons in Lancashire and Herefordshire (among the Papists there) use still to give the poor on this day: and they, in retribution of their charity, hold themselves obliged to say this old couplet :

— ' God have your Saul,  
Beens and all."

...

"It is worth remarking:," says Tollet, in a note in Johnson's and Stevens's Shakespeare, Two Gent, of Verona, act. ii. sc. 2. "that on All Saints Day, the poor people in Staffordshire, and perhaps in other country places, go from parish to parish *a Souling*, as they call it, i. e. begging and puling (or singing small as Bailey's Dictionary explains puling) for *Soul Cakes*, or any good thing to make them merry. This custom is mentioned by Peck, and seems a remnant of popish superstition to pray for departed souls, particularly those of friends. The Souler's Song in Staffordshire is different from that which Mr. Peck mentions, and is by no means worthy of publication."

If it was not an indecent one, which it is hardly possible to imagine it was, I cannot help observing that Mr. Tollet might as well have not mentioned the custom at all, as have kept back the song.

[Aubrey, in the "Remains of Gentilisme," MS. Lansd. Brit. Mus. 226, says that, in his time, in Shropshire, &c. there was set upon the board a high heap of Soul-cakes, lying one upon an- other, like the picture of the Shew-bread in the old Bibles. They were about the bigness of two- penny cakes, and every visitant that day took one. He adds, "There is an old rhyme, or saying, *'A Soule-cake, a Soule-cake, have mercy on all Christen Soules for a Soule-cake.'*"]

The Custom of giving DOLES and INVITING THE POOR TO FUNERALS.

Doles were used at Funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostom, to procure Rest to the Soul of the deceased, that he might find his Judge propitious [`a Greek quotation is given, cited as Homilia
xii. in Matthei cap. non.`] The giving of a Dole, and the inviting of the Poor [footnote] on this occasion, are synonimous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject, in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durand, speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says: "The poor also shed their Tears; precious and fruitful Tears, that washed away the Sins of the deceased. They let fall floods of redeeming Teares." From such passages as the above in the first Christian Writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead.



FOOTNOTE:

Preterea convocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacerdotes et Religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." Durand.

Had our famous Poet, Mr. Pope, an eye to this in ordering by will poor men to support his Pall?

By the Will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, executed April 29. 1397. he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his Body at the Conventual Church of Bustlesham, in which it was to be deposited." See Warner's Topographical Remarks relating to the South-Western Parts of Hampshire, vol. ii. p. 73.

Strutt, in his English Era, tells us, that Sir Robert Knolles in the eighth year of Henry IV. died at his Manor in Norfolk, and his dead Body was brought in a Litter to London with great pomp and much Torch Light, and it was buried in the White Friars Church, "where was done for him a solemn Obsequie, with a great Feaste and *lyberal Dole* to the poore." This Custom, says Strutt, of giving a Funeral Feast to the chief Mourners, was universally practised all over the Kingdom, as well as giving Alms to the poor, in proportion to the Quality and Finances of the deceased. Manners and Customs, vol. ii. p. 209.

See a curious Account of Doles in Dr. Ducarel's Tour through Normandy, fol. edit. p. 81.

Among the Articles of Expence at the Funeral of Sir John Rudstone, Mayor of London, 1531. given by Strutt (Manners and Customs, vol. iii. p. 169.) from MS Harl. 1231. we find the following charges :

£ s. d.
"Item, to the priests at his ennelling [the receiving of extreme unction] ...O 9 0 
To poor folke in almys 1 5 O 
22 Days to 6 poor folke 02 0 
26 Days to a poor folke 0 0 8"

Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, vol. i. p. 579. speaking of Eskdale chapelry, says: "Wakes and Doles are customary; and weddings, christenings, and Funerals, are always attended by the Neighbours, sometimes to the amount of a hundred people. The popular diversions are hunting and cockfighting."

Mr. Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, (vol. ii. part i. p. 357.) speaking of Stathern in Framland Hundred, says: "In 1790, there were 432 Inhabitants; the number taken by the last person who carried about Bread, which was given for *dole* at a Funeral; a Custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse." "The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by Will; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was seldom omitted. On such occasions a small Loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect." [Mr. Lysons, in his Environs of London, vol. iii. p. 341. speaking of some lands said to have been given by two maiden gentlewomen, to the parish of Paddington, for the purpose of distributing Bread, Cheese, and Beer, among the inhabitants on the Sunday before Christmas Day, tells us that they are now let at 21*l* per annum, and that "the bread was formerly thrown from the Church steeple to be scrambled for, and part of it is still distributed in that way.]

Mr. Pennant in his History of Whiteford Parish, p. 99. says: "Offerings at Funerals are kept up here, and I believe, in all the Welsh Churches."

Mr. Pennant's MS. relative to North Wales, says: "In North Wales, pence and half-pence, (in lieu of little rolls of Bread) which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, layd upon the bier and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter or cousin, (never done by a man) gives over the corps to one of the poorest Neighbours three 2d. or four 3d. white Loaves of Bread, or a Cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden Cup of Drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the Minister, if present, says the Lord's Prayer, and then they set forward for Church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor Body, are brought upon a large Dish, over the Corpse, and the poor Body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his Friend and Neighbour deceased." [This custom is evidently a remain of the Sin-Eating, see pp.155. 156.]

It appears from the Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. v. p. 523. that at Glasgow large Donations at Funerals are made to the Poor, "which are never less than £5. and never exceed ten Guineas, in which case the Bells of the City are tolled."

In "Dives and Pauper," First Precept, chap. 63. we read: "*Dives*. What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoren to the pore folke blynde and lame? *Pauper*. Comonly in such prive buriynges ben *ful smalle doles and lytel almes yoven, and in solemne buriynges been grete Doles and moche Almesse yoven for moche pore people come thanne to seke almesse*. But whanne it is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and fewe come to axe almesse! for they wote nat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that summe fals Executoures that wolde kepe alle to themself, biganne firste this errour and this folye, that wolden make themself riche with ded mennys godes and nat dele to the pore after dedes wylle, as nowe all false Executoures use by Custome."

FUNERALS IN THE CHURCH-PORCH.

[Many relations might be given of funerals having been solemnized within the church-porch. St. Awdry, who died of the pestilence in the year 669, and St. Chad, who probably, says the Rev. Mr. Samuel Pegge, did not outlive the year 672, with other persons of that era, of extraordinary reputed sanctity, being anxious to creep near the church, [[Until the time of Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose pontificate began a.d. 740, and ended in 748, the custom of burying within the precincts of towns and cities did not prevail. Vide Matt. Parker's Antiq. p. 91, and Staveley's Hist, of Churches, p. 26.]] were the first persons placed there. Among the many legends relative to St. Swithin, there is one stating that his corpse not being allowed to enter the church, it was placed in the church-porch, where it remained forty days, during which time it rained incessantly. This account agrees in some measure with the Latin legend quoted in Lord Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors; which I imagine William of Malmsbury has also given us as a proof of St. Swithin's great humility: "for when he was about to bid farewell to this life, he gave orders to be buried outside the church, exposed to the rain dropping from the skies, and the treading of the passers-by"; and so he continued for some time; but the ecclesiastics not liking that a person of his sanctity should be so exposed, dug him up, when it is probable that, agreeably with his desire to be buried outside the church, they placed him in the porch.

[It w'as the practice among the Romans to lay the dead body in the porch of their houses, near the threshold, that passengers might inspect it, and be satisfied whether there were any signs of a violent death. For the benefit of a clearer view, the corpse w'as set in the position here mentioned, the feet towards the door; which custom Perseus thus alludes to in his third Satire :

"See now the trumpets and the torches! — see 
Our spark laid out in sad solemnity! 
Stretch'd on the bier, bedaub'd with unguents o'er, 
While his stiff heels lie pointed to the door." 

This mode of placing the dead was likewise in use among the Greeks, Hom. II. xix. V. 212.]

The churchwardens' accounts of Banwell, Somersetshire, contain the following curious items: "1521. Reed, of Robart Cabyll, for the lyying of his wyffe in the *porche, 3s. 4d.* Reed, of Robart Blandon, for lyyng of his wyffe in the *church, 6s. 8d.*" By which it appears that the fee was as much again for burying in the church as in the porch.]

SIN EATERS.

The following is extracted from Bagford's letter relating to the antiquities of London, printed in Leland's Collectanea, i. 76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient heathens?"

Aubrey's collection, here mentioned, was most probably the Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism, still preserved among the Lansdowne MSS., whence the following remarks on this subject, in Mr. Aubrey's own hand, have been extracted: "In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. 'And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and he shall let the goat goe into the wilderness.' This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed, according to her will: and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. ["E.g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome."] I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." [MS. Lansd. 226, fol. 116. In another page Aubrey says: "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales;" where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer.]

Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey's MS.: "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church-porch."

pp. 288-9

DOLES AND INVITATIONS AT FUNERALS.

Doles were used at funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostom, to procure rest to the soul of the deceased, that he might find his judge propitious. [Greek quotation in footnote.]

The giving of a dole, and the inviting of the poor ["Preteria convocabantur et invitabantur necdum sacerdotes et religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." Durand. Had our famous poet, Mr. Pope, an eye to this in ordering, by will, poor men to support his pall? By the will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, executed April 29, 1397, he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his body at the conventual church of Bustlesham, in which it was to he deposited." See Warner's Topographical Remarks, relating to the Southwestern parts of Hampshire, ii. 73.] on this occasion, are synonymous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durand. Speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says: "The poor also shed their tears; precious and fruitful tears, that washed away the sins of the deceased. They let fall floods of redeeming tears." From such passages as the above in the first Christian writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead.

Strutt, in his English AEra, tells us that Sir Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of Henry IV., died at his manor in Norfolk, and his dead body was brought in a litter to London with great pomp and much torchlight, and it was buried in the White Friars' church, "where was done for him a solemn obsequie, with a great feast and *lyberal dole* to the poore." This custom, says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners, was universally practised all over the kingdom, as well as giving alms to the poor, in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased. Manners and Customs, ii. 209. See a curious account of doles in Dr. Ducarel's Tour through Normandy, fol. ed. p. 81.

Among the articles of expense at the funeral of Sir John Rudstone, Mayor of London, 1531, given by Strutt, iii. 169, from MS. Harl. 1231, we find the following charges: "Item, to the priests at his ennelling, [Anointing with holy oil. See Halliwell's Dict., p. 61.] 9s.; to poor folke in almys, 5s.; 22 days to 6 poor folke, 2s.; 26 days to a poor folke, 8d." Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, i. 579, speaking of Eskdale chapeiry, says: "Wakes and doles are customary; and weddings, christenings, and funerals are always attended by the neighbours, sometimes to the amount of a hundred people. The popular diversions are hunting and cock-fighting." Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, ii. part i. p. 357, speaking of Stathern in Framland hundred, says: "In 1790 there were 432 inhabitants, the number taken by the last person who carried about bread, which was given for *dole* at a funeral; a custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse. The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by will; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was sel-dom omitted. On such occasions a small loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect. [Mr, Lysons, in his Environs of London, iii. 341, speaking of some lands said to have been given by two maiden gentlewomen to the parish of Paddington, for the purpose of distributing bread, cheese, and beer among the inhabitants on the Sunday before Christmasday, tells us that they are now let at £21 per annum, and that "the bread was formerly thrown from the church-steeple to be scrambled for, and part of it is still distributed in that way."]

Pennant, in his History of Whiteford Parish, p. 99, says: "Offerings at funerals are kept up here, and, I believe, in all the Welsh churches." He also says: "In North Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of little rolls of bread), which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, laid upon the bier, and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives, over the corpse, to one of the poorest neighbours, three 2d. or four 3d. white loaves of bread, or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister, if present, says the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward for church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor body are brought upon a large dish over the corpse, and the poor body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his friend and neighbour deceased." This custom is evidently a remain of the *Sin-Eating*, q. v.

It appears from the Statistical Account of Scotland, v. 523, that at Glasgow large donations at funerals are made to the poor, "which are never less than five pounds, and never exceed ten guineas, in which case the bells of the city are tolled."

In Dives and Pauper, First Precept, chap. 63, we read :
"*Dives.* What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoven to the pore folke blynde and lame? — *Pauper*. Comonly in such prive buriynges ben *ful smalle doles and lytel almes yoven, and in solemne buriynges been grete doles and moche almesse [Alms. See examples in nalliwell's Dict., p. 47. ] yoven, for moche pore people come thanne to seke almesse*. But whanne it is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and fewe come to axe almesse! for they wote nat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that summe fals executoures that wolde kepe alle to themself biganne firste this errour and this folye, that wolden make themself riche with ded mennys godes, and nat dele to the pore after dedes wylle, as noweall false executoures use by custome." ["The auncient fathers, being veri desirous to move their audience unto charitye and almose dedes, did exhorte them to refresh the poore and to give almoses in the funeralles, and yeares myndes of their frendes and kynnesfolkes, in stedde of the bankettes that the paynymes and heathen were wont to make at suche doinges, and in stedde of the meates that they did bring to their sepulchres and graves." The Huntyng of Purgatory, by Veron, 1561, f. 106]
