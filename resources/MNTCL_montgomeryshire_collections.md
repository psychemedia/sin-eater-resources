A Slight Historical and Topographical Sketch of The Parish of Llanfechain, in the County of Montgomery

The sacramental vessels belonging to the church are of a better order than are generally to be found in old parishes. They consist of (1) a handsome and massive silver flagon, calculated to contain about three pints, with an appropriate lid. It is inscribed "Ex on Oweni Lyod, Rectoris de Llanfechen, 1691;" (2) a good silver chalice with a cover, constituting a convenient paten. It has the following inscription on it:â€“ "The gif of Mary Kynaston, the daughter of Humphrey Kynaston, of Bryngwyn, Esq.;" (3) a fair sized silver plate given by Mrs. Mary Roberts, and inscribed, "Ex dono M.R., 1682;" and (4) a small silver chalice, inscribed "The Cup of Llanfechain." This last has been much battered, the injuries having in all probability been occasioned by its conveyance to and fro for the administration of the Holy Communion to the sick and aged. Whether this was the chalice enumerated in the terrier returned in A.D. 1705, and represented as having a *covering to it*, cannot now be ascertained. All account of such a chalice is wanting in the terrier, A.D> 1774; but it was found here, such as it is, by the present rector, but without any *covering*.

A curious fact connected with the large flagon must be here adverted to. It had long been the custom to permit it (the large flagon) to be used at funerals in the parish, for the purpose of handing out to each of the attendants on the occasion the spiced drink, wine or ale, as the case may be. Such a desecration of the sacred vessel was peremptorily resisted by the present Rector at his entrance upon the incumbency, but not without his incurring much obloquy, and giving much offence."
