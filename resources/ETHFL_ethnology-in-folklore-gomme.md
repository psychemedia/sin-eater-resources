Another group of such practices surviving in folklore represents by symbolisation a still further step in the genealogy. A note by Bishop White Kennet speaks of a ' custom which lately obtained at Amersden in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of ale just after the interment 
were brought to the minister in the church porch.' 2 
This, in the opinion of the writer, seems ' a remainder ' of the custom of sin-eating, and it is probable he is right. The sin-eating custom is thus given by Aubrey : 'In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to have poor people who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. The manner was that when the corps was brought out of the house and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar bowle of maple (gossips bowle) full of

beer, which he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.' ' Aubrey specifically mentions Hereford, Ross, Dynder (' volens nolens the parson of ye Parish '), and ' in other places in this countie,' as also in Breconshire, at Llangors, ' where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome,' and in North Wales, where, instead of a ' bowle of beere they have a bowle of milke.'

This account is circumstantial enough. Bagford, in 
his well-known letter to Hearne (1715), mentions the same custom as obtaining in Shropshire, ' in those villages adjoyning to Wales.' His account is : ' When a person dyed there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat which he put in his pocket ; a crust of bread which he ate ; and a full bowle of ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced with a composed gesture the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.' 2 There seems some evidence of this custom being in vogue at

Llandebie, near Swansea, until about 1850, 1 where the ceremony was not unlike that described as having been practised in the west of Scotland. ' There were persons,' says Mr. Napier, ' calling themselves sin-eaters, who when a person died were sent for to come and eat the sins of the deceased. When they came their modus oj>e- randi was to place a plate of salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse and repeat a series of incantations, after which they ate the contents of the plates and so relieved the dead person of such sins as would have kept him hovering around his relations, haunting them with his imperfectly purified spirit, to their great annoyance and without satisfaction to himself/ 2 The Welsh custom, as described by Mr. Moggridge, adds one important detail not noted with reference to the other customs namely, that after the ceremony the sin-

The Welsh practice of the relatives of the deceased distributing bread and cheese to the poor over the coffin seems to me to confirm the evidence for the Welsh sin-eater. One of Elfric's canons says, inter alia, ' Do not eat and drink over the body in the heathenish manner.' Wilkins, Con- 
cilia, i. 255. 

2 Napier, Folklore of the West of Scotland, p. 60. I am not quite satisfied with this example. Mr. Napier evidently is not minutely describing an actual observance, and in his book he frequently refers to customs elsewhere. In this instance he does not appear to be alluding to any other than Scottish customs, and it is to be noted that his details differ from Aubrey's and Bagford's, nor can I trace any authority for his details except his own observation, unless it be from Mr. Moggridge's account in Arch. Cambrensis, which, however, it does not follow exactly. He is so reliable in respect of all his own notes that I should not doubt this if it were not for the certain amount of vagueness about the language.

eater ' vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze.'

The chief points in these remarkable customs are : 

(1 ) The action of passing the food over the corpse, as if thereby to signify some connection with the corpse ;

(2) The immediate disappearance of the sin-eater ; 
and

(3) The object of the ceremony to prevent the spirit of the deceased from annoying the living. 

In these customs clearly something is symbolised 
by the supposed eating up of the sins of the deceased. 1 
As Mr. Frazer has observed in reference to these practices, ' the idea of sin is not primitive.' 2 I do not think with Mr. Frazer that the older idea was that death was carried away from the survivors. Something much less subtle than this must have originated all these practices, or they could not have been kept up in so materialistic a form. Folklore tends to become less material as it decays ; it goes off into almost shadowy conceptions, not into practices which of themselves are horrid and revolting. These practices, then, must be the indicator which will help us to translate the symbolism of folklore into the usage of primitive life. The various forms of the survival seem to indicate

1 I must acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Hartland for the use I make of the custom of sin-eating. He was good enough to draw my attention to a study of the subject he was preparing, and which since the above passage was written he has read before the Folklore Society.

that we have here a group of customs and beliefs relating to some unknown cult of the dead a cult which, when it was relegated to the position of a survival by some foreign force which arrested development and only brought decay and change, showed no tendency towards any high conception of future bliss for the deceased in spirit-land ; a cult which was savage in conception, savage in the methods of carrying out the central idea which promoted it, savage, too, in the results which must have flowed from it and affected the minds and associations of its actors.
