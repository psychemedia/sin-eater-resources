Preface

I HAVE sought in this book to ascertain and set forth the principles upon which folklore may be classified, in order to arrive at some of the results which should follow from its study. That it contains ethnological elements might be expected by all who have paid any attention to recent research, but no attempt has hitherto been made to set these elements down categorically and to examine the conclusions which are to be drawn from them.

It is due to the large and increasing band of folklore devotees that the uses of folklore should be brought forward. The scoffer at these studies is apt to have it all his own way so long as the bulk of the books published on folklore contain nothing but collected examples of tales, customs, and superstitions, arranged for no purpose but that of putting the facts pleasantly before readers. But, more than this, recent research tends to show the increasing importance of bringing into proper order, within reasonable time, all the evidence that is available from different sources upon any given subject of inquiry. Looked at in this light, ethnology has great claims upon the student. The science of culture has almost refused to deal with it, and has been content with noting only a few landmarks which occur here ami there along the lines of development traceable in the elements of human culture. But the science of history has of late been busy with many problems of ethno- logical importance, and has for this purpose turned sometimes to craniology, sometimes to archeology, sometimes to philology, but rarely to folklore. If folk- lore, then, does contain ethnological facts, it is time that they should be disclosed, and that the method of dis- covering them should be placed before scholars.

Of course, my attempt in this direction must not be looked upon in any sense as an exhaustive treatment of the subject, and I am not vain enough to expect that all my conclusions will be accepted. I believe that the time has come when every item of folklore should be docketed and put into its proper place, and I hope I have done something towards this end in the following pages. When complete classification is attempted some of the items of folklore will be found useless enough. But most of them will help us to understand more of the development of thought than any other subject; and many of them will, if my reading of the evidence is correct, take us back, not only to stages in the history of human thought, but to the people who have yielded up the struggle of their minds to the modern student of man and his strivings.

At the risk of crowding the pages with footnotes, I have been careful to give references to all my authorities for items of folklore, because so much depends upon the value of the authority used in these studies. I believe they are all quoted accurately, but shall always be glad to know of any corrections or additions.

Professor Rhys has kindly read through my proofs, and I am very grateful for the considerable service he has thereby rendered me.

Chapter 1

Survival and Development

THERE has grown up of late years a subject of inquiry- first antiquarian merely, and now scientific into the peasant and local elements in modern culture, and this subject has not inaptly been termed ' folklore.' Almost always at the commencement of a new study much is done by eager votaries which has to be undone as soon as settled work is undertaken, and it happens, I think, that because the elements of folklore are so humble and unpretentious, because they have to be sought for in the peasant's cottage or fields, in the children's nursery, or from the lips of old gaffers and gammers, that unusual difficulties have beset the student of folklore. Not only has he to undo any futile work that stands in the way "of his special inquiry, but he has to attempt the rebuilding of his edifice in face of contrasts frequently drawn between the elements which make up his subject and those supposed more dignified elements with which the historian, the archaeologist, and the philologist have to deal.

The essential characteristic of folklore is that it consists of beliefs, customs, and traditions which are far behind civilisation in their intrinsic value to man, though they exist under the cover of a civilised nationality. This estimate of the position of folklore with reference to civilisation suggests that its constituent elements are survivals of a condition of human thought more backward, and therefore more ancient, than that in which they are discovered.

Except to the students of anthropology, the fact of the existence of survivals of older culture in our midst is not readily grasped or understood. Historians have been so engrossed with the political and commercial progress of nations that it is not easy to determine what room they would make in the world for the non-progressive portion of the population. And yet the history of every country must begin with the races who have occupied it. ...

The Ethnic Genealogy of Folklore

[The chapter reviews the genealogy of a particular class of traditions, specifically, *"Eating of dead kindred"*, as charted on p. 124. The following excerpt relates specifically to a consideration of the sin-eater tradition, but the wider review is worth reading.]

...

Another group of such practices surviving in folklore represents by symbolisation a still further step in the genealogy. A note by Bishop White Kennet speaks of a 'custom which lately obtained at Amersden in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of ale just after the interment were brought to the minister in the church porch.' `[Aubrey's *Remaines of Gentilisme*, p. 24.]` This, in the opinion of the writer, seems ' a remainder ' of the custom of sin-eating, and it is probable he is right. The sin-eating custom is thus given by Aubrey: 'In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to have poor people who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. The manner was that when the corps was brought out of the house and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar bowle of maple (gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (*ipso facto*) all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.' `[Aubrey's Remaines of Gentilisme, pp. 35, 36.]` Aubrey specifically mentions Hereford, Ross, Dynder ('*volens nolens* the parson of ye Parish'), and 'in other places in this countie,' as also in Breconshire, at Llangors, 'where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome,' and in North Wales, where, instead of a  bowle of beere they have a bowle of milke.'

This account is circumstantial enough. Bagford, in his well-known letter to Hearne (1715), mentions the same custom as obtaining in Shropshire, 'in those villages adjoyning to Wales.' His account is: 'When a person dyed there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread which he ate; and a full bowle of ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced with a composed gesture the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.' `[Leland's Collectanea, i. lxxvi.]` There seems some evidence of this custom being in vogue at Llandebie, near Swansea, until about 1850, [^ETHFL_118_1] where the ceremony was not unlike that described as having been practised in the west of Scotland. 'There were persons,' says Mr. Napier, 'calling themselves sin-eaters, who when a person died were sent for to come and eat the sins of the deceased. When they came their *modus operandi* was to place a plate of salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse and repeat a series of incantations, after which they ate the contents of the plates and so relieved the dead person of such sins as would have kept him hovering around his relations, haunting them with his imperfectly purified spirit, to their great annoyance and without satisfaction to himself'. [^ETHFL_118_2] The Welsh custom, as described by Mr. Moggridge, adds one important detail not noted with reference to the other customs namely, that after the ceremony the sin-eater 'vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze.'

[^ETHFL_118_1]: Archaologia Cambrensis, iii. 330; Journ. Antlirop. Iit. v. 423; Wirt Sikes, British Goblins, pp. 326, 327. The Welsh practice of the relatives of the deceased distributing bread and cheese to the poor over the coffin seems to me to confirm the evidence for the Welsh sin-eater. One of Elfric's canons says, inter alia, 'Do not eat and drink over the body in the heathenish manner.' Wilkins, Concilia, i. 255.

[^ETHFL_118_2]: Napier, Folklore of the West of Scotland, p. 60. I am not quite satisfied with this example. Mr. Napier evidently is not minutely describing an actual observance, and in his book he frequently refers to customs elsewhere. In this instance he does not appear to be alluding to any other than Scottish customs, and it is to be noted that his details differ from Aubrey's and Bagford's, nor can I trace any authority for his details except his own observation, unless it be from Mr. Moggridge's account in Arch. Cambrensis, which, however, it does not follow exactly. He is so reliable in respect of all his own notes that I should not doubt this if it were not for the certain amount of vagueness about the language.

The chief points in these remarkable customs are :

(1) The action of passing the food over the corpse, as if thereby to signify some connection with the corpse ;

(2) The immediate disappearance of the sin-eater ;
and

(3) The object of the ceremony to prevent the spirit of the deceased from annoying the living. 

In these customs clearly something is symbolised by the supposed eating up of the sins of the deceased. [^ETHFL_119_1]  As Mr. Frazer has observed in reference to these practices, 'the idea of sin is not primitive.' [^ETHFL_119_2] I do not think with Mr. Frazer that the older idea was that death was carried away from the survivors. Something much less subtle than this must have originated all these practices, or they could not have been kept up in so materialistic a form. Folklore tends to become less material as it decays; it goes off into almost shadowy conceptions, not into practices which of themselves are horrid and revolting. These practices, then, must be the indicator which will help us to translate the symbolism of folklore into the usage of primitive life. The various forms of the survival seem to indicate that we have here a group of customs and beliefs relating to some unknown cult of the dead a cult which, when it was relegated to the position of a survival by some foreign force which arrested development and only brought decay and change, showed no tendency towards any high conception of future bliss for the deceased in spirit-land; a cult which was savage in conception, savage in the methods of carrying out the central idea which promoted it, savage, too, in the results which must have flowed from it and affected the minds and associations of its actors.

[^ETHFL_119_1]  I must acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Hartland for the use I make of the custom of sin-eating. He was good enough to draw my attention to a study of the subject he was preparing, and which since the above passage was written he has read before the Folklore Society. 

[^ETHFL_119_2]  Frazer, Golden Bough, ii. 152, note; Miss Burne also seems to suggest this idea (Shropshire Folklore, p. 202).
