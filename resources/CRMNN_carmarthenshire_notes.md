THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Some years ago, an account of the sin-eater appeared in a London periodical. The function of this person was to attend funerals, and eat the deceased's sins with cakes, swilled down with nut brown ale on the coffin. It was alleged that sin-eating took place at Llandebie in 1852. The Rev. Daniel Silvan Evans, the lexicographer, made enquiries and found there was no foundation to the story, and that the sin eater was a myth. I lived at Llandebie in that year, and never heard of such a superstitiou. Have any of your readers heard of this superstition in other parts of the country?
