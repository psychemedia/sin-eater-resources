SOME OLD WELSH FUNERAL CUSTOMS.

Reading Paxton Hood's *Christmas Evans* — a good book, but inclined to exaggeration— I found the following :— "The superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now [about 1881] in the secluded Vaie of Cwm-Aman, in Carmarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular institution was that, when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread ön the breast of the deceased person; he then uttered an incantation over thie bread, after which he proceeded to eat it— thereby eating the sins of the dead person ; this done he received a fee of two-and-sixpence. . . Having received this, he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aidinj his exit with blows and sticks, and other indications oî their faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since, and through the ages beyond that time, we suppose this superstition was everywhere prevaient."

NOTES. THE SIN-EATER

(*ante* Feb. 25. 1888).

I find in a volume of Blackwood's (Nov., 1875) a little more information on this interesting superstition. The writer says :—

'The Scapegoat is a dark and narrow superstition still surviving in North and South Wales and the Borders. It is hard to say which is the most degraded, the employers or the employed in the transaction. (A man who gains his livíng by such services, is hired when a funeral takes place, is given a loaf of bread and a maple bowl of beer or tnilk, and a sixpence, for which he bears away all the sins of the deceased and prevents him or her walking after death.) The scapegoat in this case is currently called a 'Sin-eater.' Of such it would be no stretch of imagination to believe that like Sion-y-Cuit, the Welsh Faust, they had sold themselves to the devil."
