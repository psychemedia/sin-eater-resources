A Welsh Superstition.— While on the subject of deaths, I must mention singular superstitious custom which lingered, not very long ago, in some of the secluded mountain-vales of Carmarthenshire. When person died his friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who, for the small sum of half a crown, actually took upon himself the sins of the deceased, by the simple process of eating them. The plan of operation was this :— A loaf of bread was provided, which the sin-eater first placed upon the dead person's chest, then muttered some incantations over it, finally eating it. Will it be credited that he was believed to have taken from the defunct the heavy weight of his sins, and to appropriate them to himself, for which act of kindness he was regarded by everybody as a tabooed outcast? Indeed, immediately after the ceremony was finished, and bad received his pay, he vanished in double quick time, it being usual custom for the friends to belabour him with sticks-if they could catch him.— *Once a Week*.

SIN EATERS. An usage called sin eating (see Hosea iv. 8) undoubtedly arose in Roman Catholic times, and, however it may have been limited to the clergy in early ages, was afterwards continued, and practised as profession, certain persons called sin eaters. In letter from John Bagford, dated 1715, printed in *Leland's Collectanea*, there is the following account of sin eater:— "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire in those villages adjoining to Wales when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him groat which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread which ate; and a full bowl of ale which drank off at a draught. After this he got from the cricket, and pronounced with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul." Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum are statements, in Aubrey's own handwriting, to the same purport.

SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PATCHES.


SIN EATERS (August 14, 1878).

In a former article on this subject I spoke of the practice as having arisen in Roman Catholic times, this statement I have to modify, for I read, in Canon Kingsley's *Health and Education* p. 224. thus— Plato speaks of lower grade of Orphic priests, Orpheotelestai, who used to come before the doors of the rich and promise by sacrifice and expiatory songs release them from their own sins and those of their forefathers, and such (the Canon says) would be but too likely to get a hearing from the man who was afraid of a weasel or an owl." Superstition has a far-reaching pedigree. A similar practice, initiated by Orphic priests, is continued by ignorant Papists (who servilely copied most if not all of the follies of paganism), and is found existing in Shropshire villages in the 18th century. Alas! poor human nature !

SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PASTURES

SIN EATERS (25 December. 1878). Can "Boileau" give any proof of the truth of his assertion that Sin Eating existed in Shropshire in the eighteenth century? Can he name single place in the county where it was practised either in the eighteenth, or any other century? Until he does, Shropshire Sin Eating must be regarded myth.

SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PASTURES

SIN EATERS (January 1st, 1879). "Proud Salopian" asks (January 1st, 1879) for proof respecting this practice. If he will refer to *Shreds and Patches* of Ang. 14th. last year, he will see what authority I relied on. In Brand's *Popular Antiquities* vol ii., p. 155-6, quarto edition of 1813, he will find all the proof which can be given; and Bagford adds, "How can a man think otherwise of this than that it proceeded from the ancient Heathens?" Aubrey further remarks. "In the county of Hereford was an old Custome at Funeralls hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskal) I remember lived in Cottage Rosse high-way The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the House and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of Beer (which he was to drink up), and Sixpence in money: in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This Custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape Goate in the old Lawe— Levit. chap xvi , v 21. 22. 'And Aaron shall lay,' &c. This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government; as at Dynder (*volens nolens*, the Parson of the Parish) the Kindred Woman deceased there had this punctually performed according to her Will: and, also, the like was done at the City of Hereford in those times, where a Woman kept, many yeares before her death, a Mazard Bowle for the Sinne-Eater; and the like in other places in this Countie: as also in Brecon (a). I believe Custom was heretofore used all over Wales (b)

"(a) E.g.f at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin. the Minister, about 1640. could not hinder the performance of this ancient Custome.

'(b) MS. Lansd, 226, fol. 116.' In another page. Mr. Aubrey says:— "A.D. 1686 This Custom is used this day in North Wales, where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer."

In the same book. Brand's *Popular Antiquities* p 193, I note there is farther account of this custom from Pennant's MS. relative to North Wales.

SIN EATERS (29 January, 1879)

Boileau stated that the custom of Sin Eating was practised in Shropshire the eighteenth century, and I asked him to mention any place in the county where it ever obtained. He is evidently unable to this, and has to seek instances in Herefordshire and Wales. The charge against Shropshire is, therefore, clearly "not proven."

SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PATCHES.

THE SIN EATER (Feb. 19,1879).

A story never loses in the repetition. Bagford (1714), who copied from Aubrey's Collections, says, "Within the memory of our Fathers in Shropshire, in those Villages adjoining to Wales, when a Person dyed there was notice given to old sire, for so they called him, who presently repar'd to the Place where the deceased lay and stood before the Door of the House, where some of the Family came out and furnished him with Cricket [a low stool] on which he sat down facing the Door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket, a Crust of Bread, which eat, and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced with composed Gesture, 'The ease and rest of the soul departed, for which would pawn his soul'" —(Leland's Collect., I., lxxvi). There is not a syllable about salt, and the custom may have been derived from the Welsh, as it prevailed only in the marches. The Pardon bowl was in use in some the larger monasteries, K. Witlaf left his horn for the monks of Croyland to quaff his health on his anniversary, and the citizens of Chichester drink wine round the city cross, and the cathedral choristers at his tomb partook of a bowl of milk pleasantly seasoned by the will of Bishop Shirborne. A relic of the custom survives in drinking the memory of the Dead.

SIN EATING

In a letter dated 1715, printed in Leland's collection, it is stated that, within the memory of the writer's father, in those villages adjoining Wales, when a person died notice was given an old sire or village patriarch, who straightway repaired to the house of mourning and sat down on "a cricket or stool, facing the fire; then one of the family of the deceased gave the sin eater a groat which he put his pocket, a crust bread which he ate, and full bowl of ale which he drank off at a draught. Finally he rose from the cricket, and with confused gesture pronounced the ease and the rest of the soul departed for which would pawn his own soul". In Hereford, according to Aubrey, "The sin eater ate his bread and drank his bowl of beer over the corpse, and his fee was 6d. instead of 4d. Bishop Kennet, to whom Aubrey's manuscripts passed, added to them a note that a remainder of this custom lingered the beginning of the eighteenth century in the parish of Amersham, in the county of Bucks.
