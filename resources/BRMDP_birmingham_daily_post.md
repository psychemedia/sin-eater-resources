Folk-lore.

A "Folk-lore Society" has been formed for the purpose of preserving the fast-fading relics of our popular fictions and traditions, legendary ballads, local proverbial sayings, superstitions, and old customs. According to the prospectus, the new society "will gather together the folk-lore articles scattered throughout English literature, and such communications the same subject as may be forwarded direct to the society, and select therefrom articles of special interest for publication by the society; and, as opportunities offer, it will print the folk-lore of the colonies and also of other countries may serve to illustrate and explain that of our own. As the society increases and its means further develop, it is intended to extend the field of its labours, so as to include the collection and publication of the the folk-lore of aboriginal peoples." Among the members of the council are Mr. F. Ouvry (president of the Society of Antiquaries), Professor Max MÃ¼ller, Mr. W. R. S. Ralston, M.A., and Mr. Edward Solly, F.R.S. Mr. Thoms has consented to act as director of the society.
