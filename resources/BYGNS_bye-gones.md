Separate publication, based on column appearing in Oswestry Advertiser


We purpose devoting a column, more or less, each week to the publication of NOTES, QUERIES, and REPLIES, of bye-gone events, interesting to North Wales and its Borders. To enable us to make the column interesting – as well as valuable to future historians, we respectfully invite the co-operation of our readers, in the supply of queries and of replies – in the loan of old pamphlets, fly-sheets, and newpapers; and where practicable, in files of old letters or other M.S.S.

We need scarcely say that all documents submitted to the editor of this column will be most carefully treated, and promptly returned. All communications for the column must be addressed 'Bye-gones, Caxton Works, Oswestry.'

Correspondents are reminded that the space at our disposal is limited, so they must not be disappointed if their communications are sometimes withheld a week or two. Correspondents are also requested to send their real names and addresses, not necessarily for publication but as a guarantee of good faith.

Death Tokens

...

I never heard of 'Grwn' death token mentioned by *edromo*, but I remember, some years ago, a highly intelligent inhabitant of Criggion, Montgomeryshire, telling me that when he was a bot, upon one occasion, during a vey heavy snow, his mother called him to her as she went up the stars one night to bed, and pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farmhouse in the direction of the church. A servant coming up the stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished in the neighbouring farmhouse. They knew, I believe, that their neighbour the farmer was unwell, but the snow was so deep that it was not until the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked, so that on the day of the funeral it was found to be impossible to take the procession by the ordinary course; so a portion of the churchyard wall was taken down, and the bier was carried through the opening. That portion was the very spot at which my friend saw the light cross on the evening of the death. –Jarco.

 CURRENT NOTES. ... The Saturday Review, in a notice of Mr Tegg's new edition of Hone's Calanders, says :— "There is scarcely an odd or obsolescent usage in regard to which Hone has not been before us with curious observation. The divination by Bible and Key, which crops up just now in an amusing story in the *Cornhill* is described in the Year Book. The superstition of the Sin Eater, a poor half-starved wretch, bribed by a dole of bread, beer, and a sixpence, to attend at a funeral, and by accepting such a tender to take upon him the sins of the defunct, is noticed in the same volume, and referred to certain counties in North and South Wales, where we have reason to believe it still exists." Can any of our readers tell us anything about this curious custom ? ... Any notes on either of these subjects would be acceptable in our Bye-gones column.

Notes

The Sin Eater

The following letter has appeared in the *Academy*. "Llanymawddwy Rectory, Merioneth: November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy* of November 6th (p. 478) I find an extract from an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death;" and this functionary, it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends. D. SILVAN EVANS."

The *Academy* of Nov. 20 contains the following letter on the subject, in reply to the Rev. Silvan Evans:–

In reference to the strange profession of "Sin-Eater," mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in *Blackwood* resides. Croeswylan, Oswestry. Askew Roberts.

The following is the information given by Hone in his *Year Book*, col. 858:-

> According to Lawrence Howell, *History of the Pontificate*, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, "They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, however, Sin Eating has been a very much more vulgar affair, and a letter from John Bagford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's *Collectanea*, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:—
>
> Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old "sire," (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

> Bagford states that he received his information from "the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounts of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own handwriting. In these he tells of "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a professional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon "at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)-

The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter signed RHEIDIOL, Twmbarlwn, on this subject, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer proceeds to say :- I lived at Llandebie many years ago, and I am well acquainted with the history of that parish and its customs and traditions, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a thing. I am well acquainted with Welsh lore in almost every parish in South Wales, which I collected for the late Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little superstitious, but he is far too intelligent to believe in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Association, that they have better foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

The Sin-Eater in Wales

The discussion on this subject, commenced in the *Academy*, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in *Bye-gones* towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the write of an article in *Blackwood*, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed; and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Combrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthanshore, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave in Dec. 1, 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are no informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the exitence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1875, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned; in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's connection.

The  Sin-Eater in Wales

(Feb. 9, 1876)

Further correspondence has appeared in the *Academy* on this question, but no fresh light has been thrown on the alleged custom. On February 26th, Mr E. R. Morris gives from Ruscoe's *South Wales* a quotation from the *Mountain Decameron*, in which "what is believed to have been the last Sin-Eater in Wales," is stated to have lived somewhere between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth, but Mr Askew Roberts, in the last number, shows, by further quotation from the book itself, that this was only a fancy sketch, founded on Aubrey's "leane raskal." In another letter, replying to one by the author of the *Blackwood* article, Mr Silvan Evans deies that gentleman to make good his assertion that the superstition is "still surviving in North and South Wales."

Welsh Decameron

The character of the *Mountain Decameron* as a work of fiction, its delineations of human nature devoid of credit, and its narratives of palpable improbabilities, will be best explained by the following review of it, which was published soon after its appearance.

"While we praise the power and skill with which many parts of these tales are written ; the picturesque delineations of nature, the transcript of manners, and the general conduct of the fable; we must protest against the groundwork of the histories themselves, which are founded on circumstances, as that of Ruth and Marmaduke, most improbable and unnatural; as love growing up between a father and daughter, ignorant of their sacred relation to each other— their unhallowed hopes— their disappointment and their death of despair. Nearly all the stories are of the same cast, containing descriptions of strong uncontrollable passions, desperate resolves, fearful vicissitudes, and violent and tragic terminations. The skill with which such tales are written only adds to the evil they are too apt to occasion; and the sympathies they excite are so powerful and distressing, as to act most disadvantageously on the mind. If Mr Downes will take up another line of fiction, and delineate the milder feelings,— the gentler and softer affections, the less harrowing afflictions,— and will build them round the more endearing events of life, he will, we are sure, draw from them more useful lessons, and form more permanently engaging works." *Gent. Mag.*, vol. viii., New Series, pp 398 9 (Oct., 1837). Llallawg.

EXORCISM IN WALES.

*(From Old Welsh Legends and Poetry in "Contemporary Review," by Lady Verney.)*

An old clergyman at the beginning of this century made a profession of exorcism. He was once asked how he could lend himself to such superstition among his flock, and replied that he could not alter their belief which made them miserable, and that a 1 he did was to give them comfort and assistance. He then gave an account of what had once happened to himself. A farmer's wife camo to tell him that they were half ruined, every thing about their place went wrong without any cause, their fences were broken, their beasts were lamed or destroyed, their poultry died, while within the house the china came to grief, the linen was burnt; she knew they were cursed, arid entreated him to come and undo the spell. He went up to the farmhouse, which was on a lonely mountain, and desired to be left alone in the kitchen. Suddenly the poor woman rushed in to say that while she was preparing tea three tea-cups had been mysteriously broken, and the servant-girl had appeared with a goose hanging to her apron. He sat considering with his head on his hand, and then desired the girl might be sent in to him. He looked at her sternly, and said, "You know something about this." She denied it vehemently: "You want to break my character." "You had better confess," he said, solemnly; whereupon she became still more violent. At last he drew out his pocket book and began to write, If you don't tell me the truth directly I will make a pair of horns to grow out of your head." She then fell on her knees, entreating for mercy, and confessed that a neighbour, anxious to get the farm, had bribed her to do ail the mischief possible in order to induce the owners to believe themselves bewitched and to leave the place. The clergyman made her promise that nothing of the kind should ever happen again; if it did, he said, he would make the horns grow instantly. He then went out and told the farmer he had uncursed the place, and all went on rightly from that time; but he had never revealed the reason until that moment.

In another case a clergyman, celebrated for exorcisms, was sent for to a house haunted by the devil close to the sea-shore. He went and spent three night3 there alone, after which he announced that he had done the deed, "but that the devil was the hardest he had ever had to deal with." He never would reveal what took place. It was probably some smuggling transaction. He died rich, as he was well paid for such operations.

REPLIES


WELSH DECAMERON (Mar. 29, 1876.)—It appears that Dr Downes died "on the Bank" in Builth in the spring of I860, and by his request was buried under some particular tree in Aberedw churchyard. He was a native of London, his father was the clergyman who officiated at the marriage of the late Duke of Sussex. Dr Downes was in the habit of going about the country, and living in a small tent, which he took along, and often his two sons accompanied him in these rambles. He was twice married, had two sons by the first and two daughters by the last wife. Dr Downes was a frequent contributor to the periodicals of the day. One of his sons is now in practice as a surgeon at 13, White-street, Southward. J.J. Brecon.

p?

Mr. Paxton Hood has made a discovery which many more experienced archaeological authorities have sought after, and failed in the search. In a life of the Rev. Christmas Evans, he has recently written, he tells us that there still exists in Caermarthenshire "the Sin Eater," a personage once universal in Wales. We thought that belief was finally scotched in the Academy discussion a few years ago. Such an accommodating official does not and never did exist in Wales, and the only authority (?) for supposing that one ever existed on the borders was old Aubrey, who tells of a "leane, hungry raskel" in Herefordshire.

POPISH CEREMONIES STILL EXISTING IN WALES.

The Rev. Canon Richards said, in his lecture at St. Joseph's, Swansea, on the recent Church Congress, that the old faith, or Popery, still lingers in men's hearts and memories, and that even now the people retain in Wales many practices once belonging to the old religion. That this is so amongst the members of the Established Church is an acknowledged fact, but that such practices still exist amongst the Welsh Nonconformists may at the first be questioned. I have long observed these strange but contradictory rites with no small interest, and possibly the pointing of them out may lead others to the same line of observation.

I will first confine myself to death and burial rites. We have much that surrounds these events that must have come down to us from the times when the holy fathers were the masters of the ceremonies.

*The Gwylnos*, or watchnight, or "Wake," is still an important service in some parts of Wales, and the form of procedure varies in several localities. This takes place on the night preceding the funeral. The neighbours and friends meet about 7 p.m. in the room wherein the body has been laid. The walls of the chamber or room being covered over with linen sheets with laurel leaves pinned on to the sheets, two leaves so placed that they take the form of the letter T or a cross, at the head and feet of the body are placed a lighted candle. In a Nonconforming neighbourhood on the borders of Pembroke, Cardigan, and Carmarthen counties, it was customary up to within 30 years, to put a lighted candle on a plate placed on the chest of the body during the *Gwylnos*, whilst placing a plate full of salt on the body was pretty general in Montgomeryshire at one time. When the friends had arrived a portion of Scripture was read and hymns sung, and prayers offered alternately with the hymns ; when, about 9 o'clock, after several friends had offered up prayer, the *Gwylnos* closed, and the friends returned to their several homes. To bury without a *Gwylnos* was considered a mark of great disrespect to the relatives and to the departed.

When Anne Griffiths of Dolwar fach, the great hymnologist, attended a funeral of a relative of the writer's she at once proceeded to the room where, on a bed, the body lay, When kneeling at the bedside she offered up a long silent prayer. At the same funeral the husband of the departed one caused a near relative to distribute a large sum of money amongst the poor people that had come to receive the dole that was thus divided previous to the "lifting of the body;" otherwise taking the body from the house to be buried. It is also customary to read a portion of Scripture and to pray, the body having been first brought from the room and placed on chairs, or on the bier at the door of the house. On starting from the house the company of mourners raise up their voices in a mournful hymn, and they continue singing for some distance as they leave the house. On approaching the church another hymn is sung, until the body is borne near to the Lych gate, where the officiating minister meets the funeral procession, the bells, as the funeral approaches the church, ringing the funeral toll. After the service is concluded in the church, the friends make an offering to the clergyman, this being made on a special table fixed to the altar railing. At the grave, again, another offering is made, on the sexton’s spade. Every one attending where the offering custom prevails is expected to uphold, as in duty bound, the usage, by contributing his quota. Formerly on retiring from the grave, which had been decorated with the laurel and box evergreens, friends retired to the village ale-house, sometimes called the "Church House," or "Ty’n-y-llan," where it was the custom to drink the "funeral ales" to the comfort of the relatives and the profit of the landlord, who, in no very remote times, was commonly the parish clerk. The first Sunday following the burial of the dead was called the "funeral Sunday," or the "second burial Sunday," when a special service was held, a funeral sermon delivered, and the departed largely received the encomiums of the minister, and the relatives were publicly "prayed for." At the close of the service I have known the relatives go to the grave, and there kneel for some time.

Another ceremony of some peculiarity, but now nearly obsolete, is *Gwylio y Corph* (watching the body). This is simply the sitting up all night in the room wherein the body is laid, of one or more of the neighbours who volunteers to do this duty. And this is done each succeeding night from death until burial. Drink at one time must have been freely supplied to the *Gwyliwr*, or watchman, hence the adage, "Hawdd yf a wyl ei wely." "He who watches his resting place will drink freely."

So much was the "drink" considered as part of the ceremonies at death and burial, that a special drink — strong home-brewed ale, strongly flavoured with spice and lemon — was provided, in a special vessel called a tankard. This was "served" with the "funeral cakes" just before starting with the body from the house. The Rev. W. Maddock Williams, in his interesting sketch of the parish of Llanfechain says, in reference to this custom, in describing the sacramental vessels belonging to the church, "It had long been the custom to permit it (the large flagon) to be used at funerals in the parish, for the purpose of handing out to each of the attendants on the occasion the spiced drink, wine or ale, as the case may be. Such a desecration of the sacred vessel was peremptorily resisted by the present Rector (the Rev. M. Williams) at his entrance upon the incumbency, but not without his incurring much obloquy, and giving much offence." (Mont: Coll: vol. v.)

The late Prebendary Davies.

In our paper of Mar. 14 we briefly announced the death of this gentleman. In the Hereford Times of Mar. 17 there was the following somewhat extended notice : —

We regret to announce the death of the Rev. James Davies, M.A., Prebendary of Hereford, at his residence, Moorcourt, near Kington, on Sunday last, in his 63rd year. Mr Davies was the second son of Mr Richard Banks of Kington, and was educated at Repton School and Lincoln College, Oxford, being a scholar on this foundation. He obtained a 3rd class "in Literis Humanioribus" in 1844, and subsequently proceeded to his B A. and M.A. degrees. He was ordained deacon in 1845 and priest in 1846 by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and held the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Forest of Dean, from 1847 to 1852. He was headmaster of King Edward's school, Ludiow, from 1852 to 1857 ; in the following year he succeeded his uncle at Moorcourt, when he assumed the surname of Davies by royal licence. He was a magistrate for the counties of Hereford and Radnor, and in 1875 he was appointed to the Prebendal Stall of Moreton et Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. He took an active interest in county and diocesan business ; amongst other things, the Church Building Society, diocesan inspection of schools, the Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, the Woolhope Club, and all local questions in and around Kington. For 21 years he regularly served a chapel of ease to the parish of Pembridge, erected by him at Moor Court. In a still wider circle he will be remem-bered in the literary world as the author of several classical works, and as a constant contributor to periodical literature, notably in the "Quarterly," "Contemporary," and "Saturday Reviews," "Blackwood’s Magazine," &c. In the neighbourhood of his home, where he was held in high esteem by all, the deceased gentleman’s death has occasioned deep sorrow ; and it is certain that a keen sense of grief will be felt throughout the large area in which he was so well known and so much respected.

The papers contributed by the deceased gentleman to the periodicals named were largely topographical. Thus in the* Saturday Review* he published one on the Upper Wye, in 1872 ; on Montgomeryshire, in 1874 ; and on The Breiddeu Hills, in 1881. The last has an interesting history for some of our readers. Mr. Davies was on a visit to Mr. Morris Jones at Gungrog, and during the visit his host invited a small party to accompany his guest for a walk over the Breidden range ; an invitation we have never ceased to regret being unable to accept. The trip, as Mr. Davies put it in his subsequent paper, was "an endeavour at determining the locality of the last battle of the Silurian hero Caractacus, with his Roman Conqueror Ostorius;" and the paper was afterwards rewritten for the *Montgomeryshire Collections* of the Powys-Land Club.

Mr. Davies was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, and a contributor to its journal. He wrote a very pleasant account, in the *Saturday Review*, of its excursion in 1874, under the title of "With the Cambrians at Wrexham"; and in 1881, he contributed a record of the Church Stretton meeting to *The Academy* , a record he afterwards amplified for the *Oswestry Advertizer*, from which paper it was transferred to the pages of the Shropshire Archaeological Society.

A very interesting article from his pen was published in *Blackwood's Magazine* for Nov. 1875, on "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales," which was the subject — or rather a passage in it was— of a hot controversy in *The Academy*. In the course of his paper the writer (he preserved his incognito throughout) had mentioned the superstition of "The Sin-Eater," which attracted the attention of Professor Silvan Evans, who challenged the writer to produce proofs. Several letters were published, and other scribes joined in the discussion ; some account of which will, probably, shortly appear in the *Red Dragon*, issued by Daniel Owen and Co. of Cardiff.

QUERIES.

THE SIN EATER. — You have more than once referred to the practice of Sin-Eating in Wales and the Borders, as resting only on the authority of Aubrey, and totally discredited by modern Welshmen. In an article I recently referred to as appearing in the *Oswestry Advertizer* for Sep. 22, 1858, something akin to the custom is mentioned, by an intelligent correspondent, who describes the custom as ancient. He says "Previous to a funeral, it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the elor, or bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a well-made Welsh cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented in the same manner a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that was done all knelt down, and the Minister, if present, repeated the Lord’s Prayer." Any reader who could quote his father or grandfather as an actual witness of a ceremony such as this, or even an approach to it, would confer a boon on Welsh Archaeology !

REPLIES.

THE SIN EATER IN WALES (April 25, 1883.) The question has been asked in Bye-gones if some of the funeral customs within the memory of those now living do not point to a more pronounced ceremony on the part of our forefathers ? One writer states — but only on hearsay — that last century it was usual, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the *Elor*, or bier, for the next of kin of the feminine gender "to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a Welsh cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After which a cup of drink was presented also over the coffin, of which a little was to be drunk immediately. When this was done the minister knelt down and said the Lord’s Prayer." No one has corroborated this from the definite information of father or grandfather ; but they have spoken of a more modified form of, perhaps, the same ceremony, within their own recollection. Less than half a century ago it was usual at every 'respectable' funeral to have made up into packets, a couple of bits of cake — one of rich plum, and the other plain — wrapped in black-edged paper and sealed with black wax. One of these was presented to each of the invited guests, who took it home unopened. At funerals of less pretention a "large round biscuit, the size and form of an ordinary tea-saucer, inverted, took the place of the packet of cake. These were 'served' to each of the parties attending the funeral (by one of the most respectable men present) on a tray called the 'Hand-board,' or 'Server.' The ceremony was gone through just before 'Raising the Body.' After this the 'Tankard' of hot-spiced ale was offered to each person present. This was made of pewter, and had a lid : everyone was expected to take a sip." In narrating this in Bye-gones of May 17, 1882, the writer also called attention to a note in the history of the parish of Llanfechain, published in *Mont : Coll :* in 1872. He became rector in 1851, and found it was usual to allow one of the sacramental vessels a silver flagon presented to the parish in 1691) to be used in place of the customary tankard — a custom he at once denounced, to the no small chagrin of the parishioners ! How far these customs form a lingering remnant of the Sin Eater, your readers must judge for themselves.

SHROPSHIE FOLK-LORE. The following interesting review of Part II. of Miss Burne's "Shropshire Folk-Lore" has appeared in the Saturday Review :— Inexperienced people might suppose that, the necessary materials being given, it would be easy to write an entertaining book on folk-lore ; but this is far from being the case. It is almost as difficult to make a book of folk¬ lore readable as a book of anecdotes or a book of jokes, and, at best, the folk-lore book is more useful as furnishing materials for historians, novelists, and poets, than as a book to be read at first hand by those who wish to be entertained. It is interesting enough to read of a local superstition, but a superstition with variations soon be¬ comes wearisome. Yet the faithful compiler of a work on folk-lore is obliged to explain that in one part of the country it is considered unlucky to see one magpie, while in another it is unlucky to see two ; that in some places three, and in others four, foretell the birth of a boy ; that four augur a wedding, according to certain authorities, and a death according to others, and that it is a question whether all these prognostications are not upset by a wise saying which begins " One for anger, two for luck," and so on. Furthermore he has to state that there are experts who consider the superstitions about magpies equally applicable to crows. Of this sort of reading it is possi¬ ble to have too much ; but the unlucky folk-lore-monger is bound to produce every variety of his wares, unless he wishes to hear his work called incomplete. The merciful critic is inclined, therefore, to take up a book of folk-lore with feelings of charitable pity for its author. He would be even more sorry for himself if he thought he were going to read it through; but of doing this he rarely has any intention, as a book of folk-lore is easily reviewed by a little dipping and a good deal of skipping. The author of the specimen before us, however, has done her work so well that she has no need to ask mercy from her critics, and her reviewer who comes to skip will stay to read. 

...


[p210-11]
Miss Burne's book on the folk-lore of Shropshire would not have been complete if she had made no mention of the tradition of the Sin-eater—a poor man who, for a small consideration, is said to have been ready to take upon himself the responsi¬ bility of all the sins of any dead person; but she very properly adds that the authorities in support of this tra¬ dition are somewhat questionable. Shropshire and Welsh archaeologists have fiercely Contested the question whether any such custom ever existed, and antiquaries must be content to leave the matter open. Miss Burne very often quotes and refers to a work called Bye-Gones, which was edited by Mr Askew Roberts, "than whom," she tells us, "few men could be more respected in life or regretted in death." This book consists simply of reprints from a column devoted to notes, queries, and replies about folk-lore in the Oswestry Advertizer, a cleverly edited Liberal newspaper, well known in Shropshire and North Wales. The example set in this respect by the Oswestry Advertizer is well worthy of imitation by other local newspapers, for Bye-Gones, of which there are now many volumes, is itself a very valuable book of folk-lore, nd if in every county in England the editor of a news¬ paper would employ somebody on a work of this kind, an immense amount of interesting and valuable information might be amassed. There are other books besides Bye- Gones and her other quoted authorities which we think Miss Burne might have found useful^ and so many local customs owe their origin to religious rites and uses of pre- Reformation periods that she would have done well to have had by her a good work on ecclesiastical customs and popular religious practices, subjects with which she does not seem familiar. We wish, too, that she had had the opportunities—opportunities hard to get—of learning the private ghost-stories of the Shropshire country houses; for the county is rich in such legends, but its inhabitants are very reticent in communicating them to strangers. Much of the folk-lore attributed here to Shropshire is common to other counties ; but it would be impossible to sift out_ what is exclusively Salopian. Such customs as the giving back of a small sum on a purchase for luck, pinching for new clothes, decorating churches, and the observance of May Day, are equally well known in other parts of England, and many of the superstitions noticed in this volume must be familiar to every body; but upon the whole this second part of Miss Burne's work is written with great ability; it ought to find a place in every library in Shropshire, whether public or private, and an inhabi¬ tant of any English county would be hard to please if he could not find a good deal in it both to amuse and interest him. A third part has yet to be published treating of several important subjects connected with folk-lore. We are also promised Eome addenda and coriigenda, and, best of all, an index—a most important matter in a work of this kind. Miss Burne apologizes for the delay in the ap¬ pearance of the second part; but, as she herself admits, the work has gained thereby," for when a well-disposed antiquary reads a book about the folk-lore of his own neighbourhood, he is tempted to send some additional in¬ formation to the writer, and he generally yields to this temptation. Our advice, therefore, to the author of Shrop¬ shire Folk-lore is not to be in a hurry about publishing the third part. T

THE CYMMRODORION SOCIETY. 

MR E. SIDNEY HARTLAND ON THE "SIN-EATER

The second lecture of the Cymmrodorion Session was given at a joint meeting of the Cymmrodorion and Folk-Lore Societies, which was held on Wed- nesday.the 10th February, at the rooms of the Royal Asiatic Society in Albemarle-street, under the presidency of ProfessorKRhys, when Mr E. Sidney Hartland. of Gloucester, who is an active member of both Societies, and the"author of " The Science of Fairy Tales," read a paper on " The Sin-Eater." Amongst others present there were :—Mr Henry Owen, F.S.A., Mr G. Lawrence Gomme, Mr Alfred Nutt, Mr T. Marchaat Williams, Mr Edward Clodd, Dr Karl Blind, Dr Gaster, Mr Sydenham Jones, Mr D. McRitchie, Mr F. A. Milne (secre¬ tary to the Folk-Lore Society), Mr E. Vincent Evans (secretary to the Cymmrodorion Society),&c, &c— The Chairman, after a brief reference to Mr Hartland's contributions to the study of folk-lore, called upon him to read his paper on " The Sin- Eater."—The earliest mention of the curious custom of the Sin-Eater, formerly observed in Wales and the Welsh Marches at funerals, is to be found, according to Mr Hartland, in " The Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme," a work of John Aubrey, (1686-7) which remained in MS. for 200 years, until it was for the first time issued by the Folk-Lore Society in 1881. The passage in question (p. 23-4) runs as follows :—" Offertories at Funeralls.—These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye ch. of Engl. Common-Prayer-booke : but I never sawe it used, but once, at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the Counties of North-Wales. But before when the Corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowie of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingravred on it, and ye parties name deceased, w'ch one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps; and this Custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales." On this there is the follow¬ ing note by Bishop Kennett:—" where a small tablet or board is fixt near the Altar, upon w'ch the friends of ye defunct lay their offerings in mony according to their own ability and the quality of the person

Feb. 24, 1892. BYE-GONES. 267 deceased..........Sinne-Eaters.—It seems a remainder of this custom w'ch lately obtained at Amersden (1) in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment were brought to the minister in the Ch, porch." Aubrey also has (p. 35-6) the following note on " Sinne-Eaters :—In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to \ JfSe \ poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them X remember lived in a cottage on Rosse high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere; a Loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, w'ch he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (me- thinkes) something to the Scape-goate in ye old Lawe.....This custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people wasjj^servedj even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian govern¬ ment : as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish,the {relations} of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this Countie ; as also in Brecon, e.g., at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custome was heretofore used over all Wales..... In North-Wales, the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of ; but there, insted of a Bowie of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke. Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good Beer.—Cramer." Ellis (in Brand and Ellis's "Obser¬ vations on Popular Antiquities," ed. 1S13, ii., 155), who quotes Aubrey from this MS., also reprints from Leland's Collectanea, vol. i., p. lxxvi., the following passage of M r John Bagford's Letter relating to the Antiquities of[London (dated Feb. 1,1714-5), giving a slightly varied account, also professedly derived from Aubrey. •'Within the memory of our Fathers in Shropshire, in those Villages adjoyning to Wales, when a Person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire (for so they call'd him), who presently repair'd to the Place where the deceased lay, and stood before the Door of the House, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket; a Crust of Bread, which he eat; and a full Bowie of Ale, which he drank off (1) Ambrosden (near Bicester, Oxon.), of which parish Kennett was vicar 1684-1691 at a draught. Afcer this he got up from the Cricket, and pronounced with a composed Gesture, The ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul. This 1 had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious Observations, which I have seen, and is now remain¬ ing in the hands of Mr Churchhill the Bookseller:" The only other mention of the custom of the Sin- Eater, of any importance, is that made by the late Mr Mathew Moggridge of Swansea at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852. His account was that " when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received his fee of 2s 6d, and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze ; for, as it was believed that he really appro¬ priated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood—re¬ garded as a mere Pariah—as one irremediably lost." Mr Moggridge specified the parish of Llandebie, Carmarthenshire, about twelve or thirteen miles N. of Swansea, as a place where the custom had sur¬ vived to within a recent period. (Arch. Gamb. for 1852, 2nd Series, vol. ii. pp. 330-2). So far as Mr flartland was aware, no explanation of this strange custom had been hitherto offered be¬ yond Aubrey's conjecture that it had some reference to the Hebrew scapegoat. He (Mr Hartland) proposed to compare it with one or two other customs in thi3 country and abroad, for the purpose, if possible, of tracing its origin. He assumed that in the custom described we have only a mutilated form of the original ceremony. Ths first point to be noted was that the rite had to do with the disposal of the dead, that the eating of food placed upon the coffin.or rather upon the body itself, was the substance of the rite, and that the belief connected with it was that by the act of eating some properties of the dead were taken over by the eater. Mr Hartland then proceeded to look for analogies, and described a custom, formerly prevalent in the highlands of Bavaria, of eating Corpse-cakes [i.e., cakes prepared from dough placed to rise on the enshrouded dead body, and afterwards baked], to which the belief attached that they contained the virtues of the departed, which virtues passed over by means of the Corpse-cakes into the kinsmen who consumed them, and so were retained within the kindred. A Dyak funeral rite in which food was placed before the dead ere the coffin was closed, to be afterwards devoured by the nearest relations of the departed, was next described ; then a curious custom in the Scottish Lowlands, called the dishaloof, in which salt played a promi¬ nent part. All these customs were pronounced to be more archaic and therefore more significant in form than the custom of doles of money and food at funerals, which was identified in the passages quoted from Aubrey, as well as by more recent writers, as a survival of the Sin-Eater. That this identification is substantially correct will be seen not only from the instances already given, but also from Pennant's statement {Tours in [Vales, ed. 1883, iii, 150-1) that in

268 BYE-GONES. Mar. 2, 1892. Wales,previously to a f uneral,it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house, for the next of kin (a female) to give over the coffin a quantity of white loaves, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor people. After that theypresented inlike manner a cup of drink,and required the person to drink a little of it immediately; then the minister repeated the Lord's prayer, after which they proceeded with the corpse. To this hour, Pennant adds, the bier is carried by the next of kin, a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased. It is not at all un¬ common, as folk-lore students are aware, for tribal, communal, and other feasts in the last stage of their decadence to come to be represented by gifts of food to the poor. The significance of the custom as related by Pennant is that the food and drink are given across the coffin by the next of kin, and that if the recipients are not required to eat the bread on the spot thev have at least to drink of the liquor offered them. Mr Hartland cited many variants of this custom in this and other countries. When these traditional observances are set side by side, their meaning, he observed, is transparent. The par¬ taking of food and drink which have been placed upon or near the body or the coffin of the deceased, or are delivered over the coffin to be consumed—an act, in the most elaborate of these rites, distinctly believed to convey to the persons who partake some, at all events, of the properties of the dead—can only be a relic of a savage feast where the meat consumed was the very body of the deceased kinsman. The eating of the dead, however repulsive to us, is known by the testimony of ancient writers to have been the practice of many barbarous tribes, and travellers have found it among modern savages. In particular Strabo records it of the ancient Irish. The inference that the cannibalism related of them was once com¬ mon to those peoples among whom similar modern practices, like those of the Sin-Eater, &c, have been found, is well within the limits of induc¬ tion. The reason for the custom is doubt¬ less to be found in the belief that the qualities of the food are communicated to the eater. The same reason which induces the wild South American warrior to love the flesh of tigers, &c, because from it courage passes into those who eat thereof, leads the Bavarian peasant to re¬ tain within the kindred the good qualities of a departed member by means of the symbolical act of eating " corpse-cakes." In the Sin-Eater the same act is put to another, but strictly analogous, use in the absorption of the sins of the dead. Why it was supposed that in the one case good and in the other evil properties were communicated we do not know. Some variation in the view taken of the matter by the clergy may have led to the rite being considered disgraceful in Wales, and so may have rendered those who persisted in it the objects of persecution. Payment to undertake the odium, the consequent degradation as well of the rite as of the person who performed it, and the influence of the Biblical account of the Hebrew Scapegoat.may have done the rest. The gifts of food to the poor, both in their immediate form described by Pennant, and in their final form as doles, however, point to a differ¬ ent interpretation of the same original observance. They can hardly be derived from the Sin-Eater; their relation to it is not lineal but collateral. They are variants of the ceremony, and variants bearing the strongest testimony to the form and meaning of the parent type.—Mr Hartland's paper was most cordially received by the company, but various points were more or less criticised by the members of both Societies. The theory set forth is undoubtedly an ingenious one, but it requires further proofs to make it altogether acceptable. So far as Wales is concerned there existed up to a very recent period some very curious funeral customs, the recital of which might throw further light on the custom of the Sin-Eater. We would suggest that persons cognisant of the customs referred to should forward their information either direct to Mr Sydney Hartland, at Barnwood Court, Gloucester (who we are sure will make thebestpossible use of all bits of Welsh Folk-Lore sent to him), or contribute it to the congenial columns of Bye-Gones for the edification and enlightenment of the public.

FUNERAL CUSTOM IN SHROPSHIRE.— The current number of Folk-Lore contains the following letter signed Gertrude Hope, and dated July 27, 1893:—" In connection with Mr Hartland's article on 'The Sin-Eater' in Folk-Lore for June, 1892, the following occurrence at a funeral near Market Drayton in Shropshire may interest you. The funeral took place on the first of this present month. The minister of the chapel where the deceased woman had been a regular attendant held a short service in the cottage be¬ fore the coffin was removed. The lady, who gave me the particulars, arrived rather early, and found the bearers enjoying a good lunch in the only downstairs room. Shortly afterwards the cofBn was brought down and placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, and the mourners having gathered round it the service proceeded. Directly the minister ended, the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present across the coffia, with a biscuit called a ' funeral biscuit.' One of the bearers being absent at the moment, the fourth glass of wine and biscuit were offered to the eldest son of the deceased woman, who, how¬ ever, refusedto take them, and was not obliged to do so. The biscuits were ordinary sponge biscuits, usually called "sponge fingers" or "lady's fingers." They are, however, also known in the shops of Market Drayton as "funeral biscuits." The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been." Ed.

SMOKING IN CHURCH.—The following ap¬ pears in the Times of Friday last: Mr Ede's reference to the sin-eater will be explained by a letter which we publish in another column :— Mr Elton B. Ede writes from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing:—Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice—namely, smoking in church—which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence. I have not seen this practice mentioned in anv book, and though it is not desir¬ able that it should be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten. Some of the readers of Bye-Gones can carry their memories back to 1850. Can they confirm this ? W.O.

THE STORY OF THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. At the meeting of the British Association, Anthropology Section, on Saturday week, _Mr E. S. Hartland, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism, said the earliest form of cannibal¬ ism was that of the eating of deceased relatives. The practice extended over the greater part of the world, and many people would be surprised to learn that traces of it were to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own islands. Not very long ago, in Upper Bavaria, when a man died and had been laid out, a cake was made of ordinary flour. The corpse was placed before the fire, and this cake, called Vol. IV. New Series[ being Vol, 13th from the beginning. ] the corpse cake, was put upon its breast to rise. The dough, in rising, was believed to absorb all the virtues of the deceased, and the cake was after¬ wards eaten by his nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peninsula an edible image of the dead was carried in the funeral procession. When the body was buried the mourners ate this image above the grave, saying as they did so, " God rest him." In Wales the practice of employing a "sin-eater" had only ceased within the memory of men still living. It was the custom for the nearest relative, usually a woman, to hand across the bier, or place upon the breast of the corpse, bread, cheese, and beer, which were eaten by the sin-eater, who pro¬ nounced everlasting rest to the departed. It was believed that the sin-eater by this means ap¬ propriated to himself all the sins which the deceased had committed during his lifetime. The Times of Wednesday contained the follow¬ ing letter from Mr N. W. Thomas of Oswestry :— " In your issue of Monday Mr E. S. Hartland is reported to have said, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism in the Anthropological Section of the British Association, that the sin-eater has only disappeared from Wales within living memory. If, as I imagine, Mr Hartland's evidence for this survival is presented to us in his article on the subject in Folklore for June, 1892, I venture to think it is wholly insufficient. Mr Hartland's words are (p. 148), ' Mr Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie. . . as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period.' These words are a paraphrase from the report of the Archseologia Cambrensis, Vol. III., N.S., p. 330. The exact words used by Mr Moggridge are as follows:—'There (near Llandebie) the above practice (of the sin-eater) was said to have pre¬ vailed to a recent period.' This evidence ia originally at best second hand; it is unfortunate that Mr Hartland has emphasized its value; in the article in Folklore Mr Moggridge's evidence has the appearance of being the result of personal observa¬ tion. Thus at the outset Mr Hartland's evidence is weakened. But to any one who has considered the discussion in the Academy in the winter of 1875-76 it seems quite incredible that Mr Moggridge's evidence should be quoted at all. Canon Silvan Evans collected the evidence on the question. Among others, the vicar of the parish and the schoolmaster testified to che non-existence of the superstition. The vicar quo ted an intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in the parish. He said that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have appeared for the last 209 years, or he would have heard of it from his father or grandfather, who lived to a great age. The vicar concluded that the statements which were made by Mr Moggridge could not be substantiated by any reliable evidence. The schoolmaster, Mr John Rowland, who lived in Llandebie in 1852,when Mr Moggridge spoke, was equally emphatic. He said he knew all the parishioners and the history of the parish, its customs, legends, and traditions, and during the time he was there he attended many funerals, but never heard of a sin-eater ; in fact, people never gave cakes at funerals in Llandebie. Is it possible that Mr Hartland has never seen

this discussion, or has he ignored it? In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to assert that the sin-eater was known within living memory in the locality named. In addition to this, in February, 1882, the Rev T. Eynon Davies published a letter in the Christian World k propos of Payton Hood's ' Christmas Evans.' Mr Davies was Congregational minister in Cwmaman, near Llandebie, and said, * Some octogenarians whom I have questioned have never seen a sin-eater,neither have they heard their parents or their grand¬ parents refer to this custom.' There is, in fact, no evidence that he ever existed in Wales at all. All the stories go back to Aubrey's ' lean, long, ugly, lamentable, poor Raskel'; and he was at Ross, in Herefordshire, if we believe Aubrey, none too strong a witness. If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the ' sin- eater ' in modern times, stamped originally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian ArchaBological Society, sealed thirty years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association. Even the Celtic friuge does not deserve this treatment." The subject was dealt with iu Bye-Oones for 1874-5 and 1876-7, where much of the correspond¬ ence in the Academy was reproduced. The following letter has also appeared in The Times :— Sir,—Amid the hurry of the concluding meet¬ ings of the British Association I did not see Mr Thomas's letter in your issue of Wednesday last; and it is only to-day that I have had an oppor¬ tunity of reading it. I am much obliged to him for calling my attention to the fact that the exist¬ ence of the Sin-Eater in Wales has been ques¬ tioned. I gather that he is a reader of Folklore. Had he challenged the statements in my article when it was published there I Bhould have been doubly grateful, since my only object is to elicit and preserve the truth : assuredly not to cast any imputation upon Welshmen. 1 have never seen the discussion in the Academy, nor Mr Eynon Davies's letter in the Christian World, to which Mr Thomas refers ; nor have I until now ever heard of any doubt being thrown upon the matter. Unfortunately I have no access here to the old numbers of the Academy. Will Mr Thomas kindly add to my obligation by lending me those containing the discussion on the Sin-Eater, if he has copies of them? Meantime I reserve all observations upon the evidence until I have seen bhem.—I am, &c, E. Sidney Hartland. Highgarth, Gloucester, 20 Sept., 1895.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. Mr E. Sidney Hartland.writing from Highgarth, Gloucester, to the Times, says:—" Your cor¬ respondent, Mr N. W. Thomas, denies the exist¬ ence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the Academy twenty years ago and of the Rev T. Eynon Da vies in the Christian World of February, 1882. By the courtesy of Mr Thomas and Mr Woodall I have now been furnished with the correspondence containing these statements. " I will deal with the negative evidence presently. Let us first see what positive evidence of the existence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey. This is true.in the sense that Aubrey is the earliest writer to mention the custom and that he gives the fullest account of it. I do not know what grounds Mr Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey's testimony. He was a careful and en¬ lightened inquirer into old customs ; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open; his bona fides is not to be questioned ; and his descrip¬ tion of the ceremony and the expressions he makes use of testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statement than casual gossip. He gives specific instances of sin-eating,not merely at Ross, as Mr Thomas says, but also at Dynder, at Hereford, and at Llangors, in Brecknockshire, with particulars as to each. He does not, indeed, Jrofess to have himself witnessed these instances, f we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye-witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to

historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt. But he does seem to have witnessed it, or a ceremony similar to it in all points except the utterance of the ritual words, at Beaumaris or elsewhere in North Wales. Speaking of offertories at funerals he says ('Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme,' page 23):—* These are mentioned in the Kubrick of y9 Ch. of Engl. .Comon-Prayer booke : but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowie of Beere, and another of Milke with y9 Anno Dni ingraved on it, & y9 parties name deceased, weh one accepts of on the other side of y9 corps; and this custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales.' Whether we are to under¬ stand that Aubrey saw this himself or not, it is clear that he made minute inquiries. A century later Pennant describes the same custom (' Tour in Wales,' ed. 1783, Vol. III., page 150). Pennant was born and lived in Wales; and we must sup¬ pose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours ana friends, if he had not himself witnessed it. " Coming down to a more recent date, Miss Gertrude Hope, writing in Folklore (Vol. IV., page 392), describes the same ceremony as per¬ formed at Market Drayton as lately as the 1st of July, 1893. The details were given to her by an eye-witness, and she significantly adds :—' The minister, who had lately come from Pembroke¬ shire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been.' If necessary, I could give other cases from Shropshire; and I ought not to leave quite unmentioned the super¬ stition still current in Derbyshire.among a popula¬ tion probably still to a large extent of Celtic ancestry, that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, in accordance with which belief wine is handed round first to the bearers and afterwards to the guests (See S. O. Addy, «Household Tales,' 1893, pages 123,124). Mr Thomas may, however, deny the relevancy of these; and considerations of space prevent my arguing the question at length here. " Confining myself,therefore,to Wales, I observe that we have explicit assertions, not merely by Aubrey, but also by Pennant, as well as the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pem¬ brokeshire. And since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie down to a few years before 1852, when his paper was written. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us.found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited; but in deference to them it is probable that in many places a compromise would be adopted. The acts would be retained, the words interpreting and completing them would be dropped. " Now, what is the negative evidence ? It amounts to this :— "1. Canon Silvan Evans, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folk lore, never found a trace of the custom, nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature. " 2. He made inquiries of the vicar of Llan¬ debie, who, together with Mr Rowland,the school¬ master, denied the existence of the practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish of whom the vicar inquired also denied it. " 3. The RevT. Eynon Davies aho denied it in reference to Cwmamman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the statements of octogenarians. " None of these denials can outweigh the positive statements already cited. The custom certainly existed entire in the 17th century at Llangors. Shorn of the ritual words, it main¬ tained itself into the 18th century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembroke- shire._ We may be sure it did not maintain itself only in these places, especially having regard to the practices at Market Drayton and in Derby¬ shire. It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans's inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeed, was, we are told, an old resident; but the clergymau had only been vicar for fourteen years, though he described himself as having known the neighbour¬ hood well for twenty-five years, which may mean much or little. We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference. In any case they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition, if it existed. The Rev Elias Owen, Diocesan Inspector of Schools and one of the chief authorities on Welsh folklore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitious of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse, ' Our people are not superstitious, I am glad to say.' His inspection over, he asked the first class, ' Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a buggan (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of any one who has seen one?' Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is, the people hide their superstitions from all such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommoi exoerience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev C. P. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel' witch-burning' case, is express, and is.
of the greatest weight on this point. The reason of the concealment comes out in his evidence. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages as the priest or the minister to the ancient superstitions. " On the whole, then, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognized bv every one), his denials and the results of his inquiries dp not countervail the positive evidence of the existence of the sin-eater in Wales; and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev Eynou Davies, whose inquiries were made later still. I have con¬ fined mvself to the hare question of fact, and have given little more than an outline of the arguments which T could adduce if I had space for them. The rite is discussed at length in the second volume of my "Legend of Perseus,' just published by Mr David Nutt. Could I have advanced here the con¬ siderations there brought forward, I venture to think they would have strongly supported my con- clusion.# I fear that, consciously or unconsciously, the denial has its roots in a mistaken national or local patriotism, which perhaps peeps forth in Mr Thomas's vehemence and in his allusion to the ' Celtic fringe.' We are accustomed to this sort of thing among the Irish, who so greatly resent Giraldus Cambrensis's account of their forefathers (in the main, I believe, perfectly true) that they call any daring lie _' a Giraldus.' It is fair, how¬ ever, to Canon Silvan Evans to pay that he entirely disclaims this very natural feeling,puttinsr the question purely as one of alleged matter of fact. My own numerous Welsh friends will not suspect me of any antipathv to their nation, or any desire to wound their susceptibilities in declining to accept Mr Thomas's verdict. I regard the sin-eater only as an interesting relic of im¬ memorial antiquity; and the last thing I should dream of would be to make its possession the basis of any imputation against Wales or the Welsh. "I have written without reference to the account in The Mountain Decameron mentioned bv your correspendent' Z.' because I have not seen that book. It is probably the nameless authority recently cited by a contributor to the Western Mail. If so, and if the account be authentic (as to which I can offer no opinion), the performance of the ceremony at night, as there described, would explain why the custom in some places eluded clerical notice." Writing on October 15th to the Times, Mr F. J. Warren (Gwynfardd Dyfed), the contributor to the Western Mail referred to by Mr Hartland, gives the following references : — " Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales : With the Scenery of the River Wye," by Thomas Roscoe, Esq. pub¬ lished in 1854 by Mr Henry G. Bohn, York-street, Covent Garden, also "Cymni Fu—Notes and Queries Relating to the past History of Wales and the Border Counties," published in 1888 by Messrs T^aniel Owen and Co., Ltd., of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In the notes in " Cymru Fu " the writers on this subject in turn draw their information from "Paxton Hood's Christmas Evans," and from " Blackwood" (November, 1875).

THE SIN-EATER IN WTALES. The following letter appeared in the Times of October 28. Sir,—Mr Hartland's letter raises _ several very interesting points which would require to be dis¬ cussed at some length. I must, however, confine myself to the question mainly raised by my first letter—the evidence for the recent.existence of the sin-eater. As I should explain, did space permit, I do not regard analogical evidence as very satisfactory,for two reasons—(1) Aubrey may have misinterpreted a ceremony which he saw (he does not tell us that the name sin-eater was used, I think); (2) the sin- eater, if he existed, may not unreasonably be re¬ garded as the result of a misunderstanding of other customs. The evidence for the recent existence in Wales of this personage ic the evidence of Mr Moggridge —a story related by him at Ludlow, and derived no one knows where, at least second hand, perhaps third, fourth, or fifth hand. Against this we have the evidence of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the Nonconformist minister —no doubt such a conjunction is enough to damn any cause; but we must remember that the school¬ master was no tyro at folklore, he had collected legends and customs for Sir Thomas Philipps." Even a clergyman and a diocesan inspector can elicit ghost stories in a strange parish. Much more can a local schoolmaster find a sin-eater. Secondly, no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the same is known. Thirdly, no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived. Even if I accepted Mr Hartland's canon of evi¬ dence I should not think that probability lay on his side. Holding that folklore requires stricter

vidence of customs, which an eye-witness might readily misinterpret, I hold to my position that the sin-eater has not existed in Wales in recent times.—1 am, &c, N. W. Thomas. New College, Eastbourne. [The Times declined to publish a fuller reply to Mr Hartland, on the ground that the subject was not of sufficient general interest—Ed.]

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.—I do nob know whether the following will throw any light on the question of " The Sin-Eater in Wales," which has again come up for dis¬ cussion :—A few months ago, six or so, I was present at the funeral of a member of one of the old-inhabitant families of Bettws-Cedewain. After the corpse was placed outside the door, and before the performance of the religious service, a small piece of cake was given, first to the bearers (but"whether across the corpse or neb I cannot now recollect),and afterwards to each of the guests. Next a glass of wine was handed to each one in the same order. I believe the custom was general in this district twenty or thirty years ago, but I have seen only one other instance of its observance within the last five years. I have never heard any ritual used.

THE SIN EATER.—A good deal of discussion has been going on in the Times, the Academy, and elsewhere as to the alleged Welsh Sin Eater, and Mr Hartland, who believes in him, supports his case by referring to the custom of dispensing cakes and drink at funerals. Has it ever been suggested, in this controversy, that the custom is probably a survival of the tribal custom mentioned by Mr Seebohm in his lecture on " The Historical Importance of the Cymric Tribal System ?" In the laws of Manu we have exactly the same division of kindred : those who are within the fourth degree of kindred are those relatives who are bound to give the cake at the tomb or rather at the hearth where the spirits of the ancestors were supposed to reside, and that giving of the cake was as it were at the root of the extreme care which they gave to the observance of the degrees of kindred; those who were beyond the fourth were not quite free, they had to give only water and not the cake. The custom would take a different shape in course of time, and wine might easily be sub¬ stituted for water. It is significant that the " next of kin " gave white loaves over the coffin. Perhaps the Pembrokeshire minister mentioned by Mr Hartland in the Academy was nearer the truth than he supposed when he said he was sorry to see " that Pagan custom " still observed. W.O.

REPLIES.

THE SIN-EATER (Sept. 2, 1896).—The custom alluded to by Mr Seebohm is plainly con¬ nected with the worship of ancestors ; the cake was offered to them by males to the fourth degree of kindred. It does not seem possible to connect an offering at the hearth with the meal which is the central point of the sin-eater ritual. N.W.T.

THE SIN-EATER (Sept. 2, 1896, May 12, 1897).—There is a long description of this old custom, as conducted in Devonshire, in S. Baring Gould's new novel, Guavas the Tinner. It is too long to transcribe into this column, but in that case a stranger was got hold of who had to eat a bit of saffron cake which lay on the dead man's breast and to drink from a bowl of spirits passed across the coffin. When he had done,all present raised a cry and threw at him sticks, cinders, and whatever they could lay hold of, and hustled him on all sides, and thrust him out of doors with the cry, " He has taken on him the sins o' the dead, Cast'm out." Will any of the readers of this column refer me to the literature of this subject? D.MR.

NOTICES OF BOOKS. Archceologia Cambrensis for January contains "Early Cardiganshire," being the address by Mr J. W. Willis-Bund at the last annual meeting, " the Oldest Parish Registers " (continued), an account of an interesting "Find of British Urns" near Capel Cynon in Cardiganshire, in August last, "the Discovery of an Early Christian Inscribed Stone at Treflys," Carnar¬ vonshire, in September, and " the Roman inscription at Carnarvon," which has long been in the Carnarvon Museum. A large portion of Folk-Lore (vol. 15, iv.) is occupied with a continuation of Mr A. B. Cook's "European Sky-God," of which we said something in our notice of the last part. This is followed by " Notes from Armenia," by J. Rendel Harris, who gives a great deal of curious and interesting information, in the course of which he mentions a custom of plac¬ ing loaves of bread on a dead body. The loaves,it was said, used to be eaten. Mr Harris leaves it to Messrs Frazer and Hartland to de¬ cide whether this was a case of " sin-eating." In Collectanea the Folk-lore of the negroes of Jamaica is continued. Here are some of their beliefs; in several cases they are like those which prevail at home : — A trembling of the lips prognosticates kissing. A rainy wedding day prognosticates an unhappy married life, and vice versd. If a friend offers a pin, pen, knife, or scissors to another their friendship will be broken. An itching of the palm of the hand betokens the recep¬ tion of money. A man of mediocrity in spiritual matters of life becomes a "rolling calf" after death, for he is too good for hell, and too wicked for heaven. A young lady who sits on a table never gets married. If you turn over your money at new moon it will in¬ crease as the moon grows. If ghosts are haunting your house nail a horseshoe over the door. Itching of the nose shows that vou are going to kiss a fool. " Dairy Folk-lore and other Notes from Meath and Tipperary" is also included in Collec¬ tanea.

THE SIN EATER.—The question of the alleged Sin Eater in Wales has often been mentioned, and discussed, in Bye-Gones. It may be interesting to give the following, from a paper in Folk-Lore (vol. 15, iv.), " Notes from Armenia." The writer, Mr Rendel Harris, visited Archag, an Armenian village, where he attended service: — At the evening service, to my great surprise, I found that when the congregation dispersed, a corpse laid out for burial was lying in the midst of the building. It had, in fact, been brought in before we came, and was to lie in the church in preparation for burial next day. I noticed that two large flat loaves of bread had been placed upon the body. Inquiry as to the meaning of this elicited no other explanation than that the bread was for the church mice and to keep them from eating the corpse. I did not feel satisfied with the explanation. Some months later, on men¬ tioning the incident to some intelligent Ar¬ menians in Constantinople, they frankly admitted that in former days the custom was to eat the bread, dividing it up amongst the friends of the deceased. Whether this is a case of sin-eating I leave Mr. Frazer and Mr. Hartland to decide. W.O.

 WELSH FOLK-LORE. 
 
 "Folk-Lore and Folk-Stories of Wales," by Marie Trevelyan (London: Elliot Stock, 10s. 61), i«i, as Mr. Sidney Hartland says in his introduction, an addition to collections al¬ ready made, like those of Sir John Rhys and the Rev. Elias Owen. The author is a col¬ lector pure and simple; she contents herself with noting down, under various heads, the sayings and stories. and superstitions which she has heard, or gathered from manuscripts or other sources, and she had the advantage of inheriting a manuscript collection made by her late father, to which have been a'dded contributions from other members of her family on both sides. Ihe collection is chiefly from South Wales, as tne reader will soon see, but the North also is V ol. XI., New Series. [Vol. 20th from the beginning] called! upon for contributions. With the north, we should think, the author is not so well acquainted as with the south. ...

...
There are many interesting stories in the section devoted to Corpse Candles and Phantom Funerals. One is from a person who, many years ago, lived at a mining village in the neighbourhood of Ruabon. In the twilight of a December day he saw a funeral procession and heard the people singing, and he was surprised to find that they passed1 the church and reached a house, where they vanished. About six weeks later he saw a real funeral procession passing the church and halting at the same house, and he learnt that the body was that of a person who had died in the south of England, and was brought home for burial next day. Another story is from Corwen: — The mam said1: "I was coming home late from a neighbouring village, wheni I suddenly heard wailing sounds a short distance in advance. I paused and listened, and suddenly found myself borne backward in a funeral procession. I dis¬ tinctly saw Ithe coffin, and recognized, one. or ijwo persons in the crowd beside me.. With the procession I was born© on to the ancient parish i church of St. Julian, and nolt far from the doorway saw a well-kniown Dissenting minister approaching and joining us. Then the whole phantom vamjslhed. I was greatly frightened, and on reaching home promptly related my < ex¬ periences. About fourteen days later, a friend of ours died in Oorwein. I went to the funeral, and, arriving rather late, was pressed backward in the crowd. Near the old church, a well- known Dissenting minister joined the procession, and in it I .recognized other people who appeared previously as phantoms."  ...

...

 Of another old custom, " Chaining the bride and bridegroom ■at a wedding," we read 'that it is " common at all country weddings to-day." This must refer to South Wales. Do any of our readers know of its survival in the north T A tempt¬ ing subject of d:scussdon is " the sin-eater," mentioned on page 276, but we will not enter into it now. It was discussed at some length in Bye-Gones many years ago, and the ques¬ tion whether there ever was such a custom in Wales is a perennial one. We have said enough to show our readers that they can find much to interest them in the book before us.
