Separate publication, based on column appearing in Oswestry Advertiser


We purpose devoting a column, more or less, each week to the publication of NOTES, QUERIES, and REPLIES, of bye-gone events, interesting to North Wales and its Borders. To enable us to make the column interesting – as well as valuable to future historians, we respectfully invite the co-operation of our readers, in the supply of queries and of replies – in the loan of old pamphlets, fly-sheets, and newpapers; and where practicable, in files of old letters or other M.S.S.

We need scarcely say that all documents submitted to the editor of this column will be most carefully treated, and promptly returned. All communications for the column must be addressed 'Bye-gones, Caxton Works, Oswestry.'

Correspondents are reminded that the space at our disposal is limited, so they must not be disappointed if their communications are sometimes withheld a week or two. Correspondents are also requested to send their real names and addresses, not necessarily for publication but as a guarantee of good faith.

Death Tokens

...

I never heard of 'Grwn' death token mentioned by *edromo*, but I remember, some years ago, a highly intelligent inhabitant of Criggion, Montgomeryshire, telling me that when he was a bot, upon one occasion, during a vey heavy snow, his mother called him to her as she went up the stars one night to bed, and pointed out to him a light proceeding slowly from a neighbouring farmhouse in the direction of the church. A servant coming up the stairs at the time was also witness to it. The light traversed a line where there was no road or gate into the churchyard, and in a moment or two all the windows of the church were lighted up, and then gradually the light went back by the course it had come, and vanished in the neighbouring farmhouse. They knew, I believe, that their neighbour the farmer was unwell, but the snow was so deep that it was not until the second day that they heard he had died at the very time they saw the light. The snow continued, and the roads became more and more blocked, so that on the day of the funeral it was found to be impossible to take the procession by the ordinary course; so a portion of the churchyard wall was taken down, and the bier was carried through the opening. That portion was the very spot at which my friend saw the light cross on the evening of the death. –Jarco.

 CURRENT NOTES. ... The Saturday Review, in a notice of Mr Tegg's new edition of Hone's Calanders, says :— "There is scarcely an odd or obsolescent usage in regard to which Hone has not been before us with curious observation. The divination by Bible and Key, which crops up just now in an amusing story in the *Cornhill* is described in the Year Book. The superstition of the Sin Eater, a poor half-starved wretch, bribed by a dole of bread, beer, and a sixpence, to attend at a funeral, and by accepting such a tender to take upon him the sins of the defunct, is noticed in the same volume, and referred to certain counties in North and South Wales, where we have reason to believe it still exists." Can any of our readers tell us anything about this curious custom ? ... Any notes on either of these subjects would be acceptable in our Bye-gones column.

Notes

The Sin Eater

The following letter has appeared in the *Academy*. "Llanymawddwy Rectory, Merioneth: November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy* of November 6th (p. 478) I find an extract from an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death;" and this functionary, it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends. D. SILVAN EVANS."

The *Academy* of Nov. 20 contains the following letter on the subject, in reply to the Rev. Silvan Evans:–

In reference to the strange profession of "Sin-Eater," mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in *Blackwood* resides. Croeswylan, Oswestry. Askew Roberts.

The following is the information given by Hone in his *Year Book*, col. 858:-

> According to Lawrence Howell, *History of the Pontificate*, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, "They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, however, Sin Eating has been a very much more vulgar affair, and a letter from John Bagford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's *Collectanea*, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:—
>
> Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old "sire," (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

> Bagford states that he received his information from "the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounts of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own handwriting. In these he tells of "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a professional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon "at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

In reference to this subject the writer in *Blackwood* states in the *Academy* of Nov. 27 that the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852 had the matter before them, when "Mr Moggridge cited a case of this supersition having occurred with five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill country of Carmarthenshire."

THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)-

The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter signed RHEIDIOL, Twmbarlwn, on this subject, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer proceeds to say :- I lived at Llandebie many years ago, and I am well acquainted with the history of that parish and its customs and traditions, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a thing. I am well acquainted with Welsh lore in almost every parish in South Wales, which I collected for the late Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little superstitious, but he is far too intelligent to believe in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Association, that they have better foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

The Sin-Eater in Wales

The discussion on this subject, commenced in the *Academy*, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in *Bye-gones* towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the write of an article in *Blackwood*, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed; and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Combrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthanshore, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave in Dec. 1, 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are no informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the exitence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1875, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned; in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's connection.

The  Sin-Eater in Wales

(Feb. 9, 1876)

Further correspondence has appeared in the *Academy* on this question, but no fresh light has been thrown on the alleged custom. On February 26th, Mr E. R. Morris gives from Ruscoe's *South Wales* a quotation from the *Mountain Decameron*, in which "what is believed to have been the last Sin-Eater in Wales," is stated to have lived somewhere between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth, but Mr Askew Roberts, in the last number, shows, by further quotation from the book itself, that this was only a fancy sketch, founded on Aubrey's "leane raskal." In another letter, replying to one by the author of the *Blackwood* article, Mr Silvan Evans deies that gentleman to make good his assertion that the superstition is "still surviving in North and South Wales."

Welsh Decameron

In *The Cambrian Quarterly Magazine* and Celtic Repertory, for 1831, being the third volume of that periodical, occurs in page 248, this paragraph, namely,—"In the press in three vols., post 8vo., the *Welsh Decameron, or Tales illustrative of Cambrian Life, Customs, &c*. Report speaks highly of this work." In pp. 467-86, of the same volume appeared an article on "Ceubren yr Ellyll, or the Bride of Nant Uwrtheyrn," stated to have been selected from the Welsh Decameron, shortly to be published." In a foot note to the heading of a poem entitled "A Bard's-Eye View of Wales, by a Hermit Poet," commenced on page 300 of volume four, it is asserted, "some of the following stanzas form a poetical preface to the Welsh Decameron, now in course of publiction". In pp.25-36 of the same volume was inserted a "letter from an Amateur Gipsy," professing to be from his "Tent in the Valley of the Pyscottwr, Caermarthenshire," the signature appended to it being "the Rural Doctor." In volume five, pp. 496-507, was added a "second letter of an Amateur Gipsy," transmitted "from his cloister in the Abbey of Llanthony." In volume four pp. 168—89, was published an account of "a Welsh Shepherd's Tragedy, founded on fact," taken "from the Journal of the Rural Doctor." In pp. 220—22. there appeared a poem entitled "A Lyric Elegy" on "Conjux Ejus, the only words left of some inscription on an ancient sepulchral stone between Brecknock and Trecastle," the name affixed to which is "J. Downes." In pp. 433—55, there was inserted an article professing to contain "conversations of poets among the Mountains," to which no name was attached. In volume five, pp. 524—45, there appeared a "Glamorganshire Legend, of the Lord of Dunraven Castle, by the Rural Doctor." The author of this and the other forementioned articles, whether under the assumed designation of "A Hermit Poet," "An Amateur Gipsy," "The Rural Doctor," or of J. Downes, I take to be, from internal and other evidence, one and the same person, namely, Doctor Downes, of Builth, Breconshire, who, in 1836, published in three post 8vo. volumes a work of fiction under the title of *The Mountain Decameron*. In the first page of the "Glamorganshire Legend" referred to above (vol. v. p. 524), he speaks "of the remote fishing village of Aber- ayron, Carnarvonshire," on the promontory of Llëyn, meaning, I presume, Aberdaron, as Aberaeron is far south, some fifty miles distant, in Cardiganshire. In the second volume, p. 76 of The Mountain Decameron, the very same error is made where Llëyn is said to terminate "in the wild fishing village of Aberayron, off which lies the island of monastic ruins, Bardsey," where again Aberdaron is evidently meant. If any reliance may be placed on what is affirmed in the passages which have been adduced, in reference to the "Welsh Decameron," namely, that it was in the press in 1831, that the romance of "Ceuhren yr Ellyll, or the Bride of Nant Gwrtheyrn," was selected from it, and that some stanzas from "Bard's Eye View of Wales" formed a poetical preface to it, it will appear that it is a separate and distinct work from the Mountain Decameron of 1836, by the same author, since the selections alleged to have been taken from the former are not to be found in the latter. In 1848 there resided at Senny Bridge, near Brecon, a Mrs Downes, but whether she waa related to Dr Downes, of Builth, I have no means of knowing, nor can I tell what became of him after 1836, as I can find no mention of his name as that of the author of any new work subsequent to that year.

The character of the *Mountain Decameron* as a work of fiction, its delineations of human nature devoid of credit, and its narratives of palpable improbabilities, will be best explained by the following review of it, which was published soon after its appearance.

"While we praise the power and skill with which many parts of these tales are written ; the picturesque delineations of nature, the transcript of manners, and the general conduct of the fable; we must protest against the groundwork of the histories themselves, which are founded on circumstances, as that of Ruth and Marmaduke, most improbable and unnatural; as love growing up between a father and daughter, ignorant of their sacred relation to each other— their unhallowed hopes— their disappointment and their death of despair. Nearly all the stories are of the same cast, containing descriptions of strong uncontrollable passions, desperate resolves, fearful vicissitudes, and violent and tragic terminations. The skill with which such tales are written only adds to the evil they are too apt to occasion; and the sympathies they excite are so powerful and distressing, as to act most disadvantageously on the mind. If Mr Downes will take up another line of fiction, and delineate the milder feelings,— the gentler and softer affections, the less harrowing afflictions,— and will build them round the more endearing events of life, he will, we are sure, draw from them more useful lessons, and form more permanently engaging works." *Gent. Mag.*, vol. viii., New Series, pp 398 9 (Oct., 1837). Llallawg.

EXORCISM IN WALES.

*(From Old Welsh Legends and Poetry in "Contemporary Review," by Lady Verney.)*

An old clergyman at the beginning of this century made a profession of exorcism. He was once asked how he could lend himself to such superstition among his flock, and replied that he could not alter their belief which made them miserable, and that a 1 he did was to give them comfort and assistance. He then gave an account of what had once happened to himself. A farmer's wife camo to tell him that they were half ruined, every thing about their place went wrong without any cause, their fences were broken, their beasts were lamed or destroyed, their poultry died, while within the house the china came to grief, the linen was burnt; she knew they were cursed, arid entreated him to come and undo the spell. He went up to the farmhouse, which was on a lonely mountain, and desired to be left alone in the kitchen. Suddenly the poor woman rushed in to say that while she was preparing tea three tea-cups had been mysteriously broken, and the servant-girl had appeared with a goose hanging to her apron. He sat considering with his head on his hand, and then desired the girl might be sent in to him. He looked at her sternly, and said, "You know something about this." She denied it vehemently: "You want to break my character." "You had better confess," he said, solemnly; whereupon she became still more violent. At last he drew out his pocket book and began to write, If you don't tell me the truth directly I will make a pair of horns to grow out of your head." She then fell on her knees, entreating for mercy, and confessed that a neighbour, anxious to get the farm, had bribed her to do ail the mischief possible in order to induce the owners to believe themselves bewitched and to leave the place. The clergyman made her promise that nothing of the kind should ever happen again; if it did, he said, he would make the horns grow instantly. He then went out and told the farmer he had uncursed the place, and all went on rightly from that time; but he had never revealed the reason until that moment.

In another case a clergyman, celebrated for exorcisms, was sent for to a house haunted by the devil close to the sea-shore. He went and spent three night3 there alone, after which he announced that he had done the deed, "but that the devil was the hardest he had ever had to deal with." He never would reveal what took place. It was probably some smuggling transaction. He died rich, as he was well paid for such operations.

REPLIES


WELSH DECAMERON (Mar. 29, 1876.)—It appears that Dr Downes died "on the Bank" in Builth in the spring of I860, and by his request was buried under some particular tree in Aberedw churchyard. He was a native of London, his father was the clergyman who officiated at the marriage of the late Duke of Sussex. Dr Downes was in the habit of going about the country, and living in a small tent, which he took along, and often his two sons accompanied him in these rambles. He was twice married, had two sons by the first and two daughters by the last wife. Dr Downes was a frequent contributor to the periodicals of the day. One of his sons is now in practice as a surgeon at 13, White-street, Southward. J.J. Brecon.

THE SHROPSHIRE ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.
(From the Oswestry Advertizer , Feb. 15, 1882.)

Mr. Paxton Hood has made a discovery which many more experienced archaeological authorities have sought after, and failed in the search. In a life of the Rev. Christmas Evans, he has recently written, he tells us that there still exists in Caermarthenshire "the Sin Eater," a personage once universal in Wales. We thought that belief was finally scotched in the Academy discussion a few years ago. Such an accommodating official does not and never did exist in Wales, and the only authority (?) for supposing that one ever existed on the borders was old Aubrey, who tells of a "leane, hungry raskel" in Herefordshire.

POPISH CEREMONIES STILL EXISTING IN WALES.

The Rev. Canon Richards said, in his lecture at St. Joseph's, Swansea, on the recent Church Congress, that the old faith, or Popery, still lingers in men's hearts and memories, and that even now the people retain in Wales many practices once belonging to the old religion. That this is so amongst the members of the Established Church is an acknowledged fact, but that such practices still exist amongst the Welsh Nonconformists may at the first be questioned. I have long observed these strange but contradictory rites with no small interest, and possibly the pointing of them out may lead others to the same line of observation.

I will first confine myself to death and burial rites. We have much that surrounds these events that must have come down to us from the times when the holy fathers were the masters of the ceremonies.

*The Gwylnos*, or watchnight, or "Wake," is still an important service in some parts of Wales, and the form of procedure varies in several localities. This takes place on the night preceding the funeral. The neighbours and friends meet about 7 p.m. in the room wherein the body has been laid. The walls of the chamber or room being covered over with linen sheets with laurel leaves pinned on to the sheets, two leaves so placed that they take the form of the letter T or a cross, at the head and feet of the body are placed a lighted candle. In a Nonconforming neighbourhood on the borders of Pembroke, Cardigan, and Carmarthen counties, it was customary up to within 30 years, to put a lighted candle on a plate placed on the chest of the body during the *Gwylnos*, whilst placing a plate full of salt on the body was pretty general in Montgomeryshire at one time. When the friends had arrived a portion of Scripture was read and hymns sung, and prayers offered alternately with the hymns ; when, about 9 o'clock, after several friends had offered up prayer, the *Gwylnos* closed, and the friends returned to their several homes. To bury without a *Gwylnos* was considered a mark of great disrespect to the relatives and to the departed.

When Anne Griffiths of Dolwar fach, the great hymnologist, attended a funeral of a relative of the writer's she at once proceeded to the room where, on a bed, the body lay, When kneeling at the bedside she offered up a long silent prayer. At the same funeral the husband of the departed one caused a near relative to distribute a large sum of money amongst the poor people that had come to receive the dole that was thus divided previous to the "lifting of the body;" otherwise taking the body from the house to be buried. It is also customary to read a portion of Scripture and to pray, the body having been first brought from the room and placed on chairs, or on the bier at the door of the house. On starting from the house the company of mourners raise up their voices in a mournful hymn, and they continue singing for some distance as they leave the house. On approaching the church another hymn is sung, until the body is borne near to the Lych gate, where the officiating minister meets the funeral procession, the bells, as the funeral approaches the church, ringing the funeral toll. After the service is concluded in the church, the friends make an offering to the clergyman, this being made on a special table fixed to the altar railing. At the grave, again, another offering is made, on the sexton’s spade. Every one attending where the offering custom prevails is expected to uphold, as in duty bound, the usage, by contributing his quota. Formerly on retiring from the grave, which had been decorated with the laurel and box evergreens, friends retired to the village ale-house, sometimes called the "Church House," or "Ty’n-y-llan," where it was the custom to drink the "funeral ales" to the comfort of the relatives and the profit of the landlord, who, in no very remote times, was commonly the parish clerk. The first Sunday following the burial of the dead was called the "funeral Sunday," or the "second burial Sunday," when a special service was held, a funeral sermon delivered, and the departed largely received the encomiums of the minister, and the relatives were publicly "prayed for." At the close of the service I have known the relatives go to the grave, and there kneel for some time.

Another ceremony of some peculiarity, but now nearly obsolete, is *Gwylio y Corph* (watching the body). This is simply the sitting up all night in the room wherein the body is laid, of one or more of the neighbours who volunteers to do this duty. And this is done each succeeding night from death until burial. Drink at one time must have been freely supplied to the *Gwyliwr*, or watchman, hence the adage, "Hawdd yf a wyl ei wely." "He who watches his resting place will drink freely."

So much was the "drink" considered as part of the ceremonies at death and burial, that a special drink — strong home-brewed ale, strongly flavoured with spice and lemon — was provided, in a special vessel called a tankard. This was "served" with the "funeral cakes" just before starting with the body from the house. The Rev. W. Maddock Williams, in his interesting sketch of the parish of Llanfechain says, in reference to this custom, in describing the sacramental vessels belonging to the church, "It had long been the custom to permit it (the large flagon) to be used at funerals in the parish, for the purpose of handing out to each of the attendants on the occasion the spiced drink, wine or ale, as the case may be. Such a desecration of the sacred vessel was peremptorily resisted by the present Rector (the Rev. M. Williams) at his entrance upon the incumbency, but not without his incurring much obloquy, and giving much offence." (Mont: Coll: vol. v.)

The late Prebendary Davies.

In our paper of Mar. 14 we briefly announced the death of this gentleman. In the Hereford Times of Mar. 17 there was the following somewhat extended notice : —

We regret to announce the death of the Rev. James Davies, M.A., Prebendary of Hereford, at his residence, Moorcourt, near Kington, on Sunday last, in his 63rd year. Mr Davies was the second son of Mr Richard Banks of Kington, and was educated at Repton School and Lincoln College, Oxford, being a scholar on this foundation. He obtained a 3rd class "in Literis Humanioribus" in 1844, and subsequently proceeded to his B A. and M.A. degrees. He was ordained deacon in 1845 and priest in 1846 by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and held the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Forest of Dean, from 1847 to 1852. He was headmaster of King Edward's school, Ludiow, from 1852 to 1857 ; in the following year he succeeded his uncle at Moorcourt, when he assumed the surname of Davies by royal licence. He was a magistrate for the counties of Hereford and Radnor, and in 1875 he was appointed to the Prebendal Stall of Moreton et Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. He took an active interest in county and diocesan business ; amongst other things, the Church Building Society, diocesan inspection of schools, the Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, the Woolhope Club, and all local questions in and around Kington. For 21 years he regularly served a chapel of ease to the parish of Pembridge, erected by him at Moor Court. In a still wider circle he will be remem-bered in the literary world as the author of several classical works, and as a constant contributor to periodical literature, notably in the "Quarterly," "Contemporary," and "Saturday Reviews," "Blackwood's Magazine," &c. In the neighbourhood of his home, where he was held in high esteem by all, the deceased gentleman’s death has occasioned deep sorrow ; and it is certain that a keen sense of grief will be felt throughout the large area in which he was so well known and so much respected.

The papers contributed by the deceased gentleman to the periodicals named were largely topographical. Thus in the *Saturday Review* he published one on the Upper Wye, in 1872 ; on Montgomeryshire, in 1874 ; and on The Breiddeu Hills, in 1881. The last has an interesting history for some of our readers. Mr. Davies was on a visit to Mr. Morris Jones at Gungrog, and during the visit his host invited a small party to accompany his guest for a walk over the Breidden range ; an invitation we have never ceased to regret being unable to accept. The trip, as Mr. Davies put it in his subsequent paper, was "an endeavour at determining the locality of the last battle of the Silurian hero Caractacus, with his Roman Conqueror Ostorius;" and the paper was afterwards rewritten for the *Montgomeryshire Collections* of the Powys-Land Club.

Mr. Davies was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, and a contributor to its journal. He wrote a very pleasant account, in the *Saturday Review*, of its excursion in 1874, under the title of "With the Cambrians at Wrexham"; and in 1881, he contributed a record of the Church Stretton meeting to *The Academy* , a record he afterwards amplified for the *Oswestry Advertizer*, from which paper it was transferred to the pages of the Shropshire Archaeological Society.

A very interesting article from his pen was published in *Blackwood's Magazine* for Nov. 1875, on "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales," which was the subject — or rather a passage in it was— of a hot controversy in *The Academy*. In the course of his paper the writer (he preserved his incognito throughout) had mentioned the superstition of "The Sin-Eater," which attracted the attention of Professor Silvan Evans, who challenged the writer to produce proofs. Several letters were published, and other scribes joined in the discussion ; some account of which will, probably, shortly appear in the *Red Dragon*, issued by Daniel Owen and Co. of Cardiff.

QUERIES.

THE SIN EATER. — You have more than once referred to the practice of Sin-Eating in Wales and the Borders, as resting only on the authority of Aubrey, and totally discredited by modern Welshmen. In an article I recently referred to as appearing in the *Oswestry Advertizer* for Sep. 22, 1858, something akin to the custom is mentioned, by an intelligent correspondent, who describes the custom as ancient. He says "Previous to a funeral, it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the elor, or bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a well-made Welsh cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented in the same manner a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that was done all knelt down, and the Minister, if present, repeated the Lord’s Prayer." Any reader who could quote his father or grandfather as an actual witness of a ceremony such as this, or even an approach to it, would confer a boon on Welsh Archaeology !

REPLIES.

THE SIN EATER IN WALES (April 25, 1883.) The question has been asked in Bye-gones if some of the funeral customs within the memory of those now living do not point to a more pronounced ceremony on the part of our forefathers ? One writer states — but only on hearsay — that last century it was usual, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the *Elor*, or bier, for the next of kin of the feminine gender "to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a Welsh cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After which a cup of drink was presented also over the coffin, of which a little was to be drunk immediately. When this was done the minister knelt down and said the Lord’s Prayer." No one has corroborated this from the definite information of father or grandfather ; but they have spoken of a more modified form of, perhaps, the same ceremony, within their own recollection. Less than half a century ago it was usual at every 'respectable' funeral to have made up into packets, a couple of bits of cake — one of rich plum, and the other plain — wrapped in black-edged paper and sealed with black wax. One of these was presented to each of the invited guests, who took it home unopened. At funerals of less pretention a "large round biscuit, the size and form of an ordinary tea-saucer, inverted, took the place of the packet of cake. These were 'served' to each of the parties attending the funeral (by one of the most respectable men present) on a tray called the 'Hand-board,' or 'Server.' The ceremony was gone through just before 'Raising the Body.' After this the 'Tankard' of hot-spiced ale was offered to each person present. This was made of pewter, and had a lid : everyone was expected to take a sip." In narrating this in Bye-gones of May 17, 1882, the writer also called attention to a note in the history of the parish of Llanfechain, published in *Mont : Coll :* in 1872. He became rector in 1851, and found it was usual to allow one of the sacramental vessels a silver flagon presented to the parish in 1691) to be used in place of the customary tankard — a custom he at once denounced, to the no small chagrin of the parishioners ! How far these customs form a lingering remnant of the Sin Eater, your readers must judge for themselves.

The Late Mr. Askew Roberts.

It is with deep regret that we record to-day the death of Mr Askew Roberts of Croeswylan, Oswestry, at the comparatively early age of fifty-eight. Mr Roberts had never enjoyed robust health, and an attack of inflammation which began while he was visiting friends in South Wales in the early part of June resulted in the long illness which closed his life on Wednesday. He returned home from Cardiff on the 13th of June, and from that time was almost continuously confined to his room, though occasionally, in the bright days of summer, he was able to bear a short journey in a Bath chair; and hopes were entertained, to the very end, that he might still he restored to his friends. For awhile the publication of the column of *Bye-Gones* edited by him in this paper was suspended, but as soon as the severity of the first attack passed away, Mr Roberts resumed the work in which he took so much delight, and he continued it to the close of his days, the last instalment, containing a contribution of his own, having appeared only last week. Indeed, his indomitable spirit so far triumphed over physical weakness that he was actively engaged in other literary work during his long illness, and the proofs of his final, and most interesting, contribution to the Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological Society, a paper on the "Gateways of Oswestry," passed through the press, under his careful revision, in the month of November. On the Sunday before his death he was as well as he had been for some time, and was able to enjoy the society of his friends, and although on Monday a change came, it did not seem to those about him to betoken any immediate danger. He still kept up his interest in passing events, and even on Wednesday morning there was no sign that life was so near its close; but at noon he passed quietly and very peacefully away, in the presence of his wife.

Mr Askew Roberts, who was born at Oswestry on the 27th of March, 1826, was the son of Mr Samuel Roberts, a bookseller in the town, and on the side of his mother, a niece of the Rev. John Whitridge of Oswestry, was descended from the family of Anne Askew, the martyr, a name which has been perpetuated in succeeding generations. For a short time in early manhood Mr Roberts resided at Taunton, but he returned to Oswestry about 1848, to take part in his father's business, and continued to live there for the rest of his days ; and in January, 1858, he married Katharine, fourth daughter of the Rev. Thomas Toller of Kettering. Mr Roberts's first literary productions, we believe, appeared in *Oswald's Well*, a magazine conducted by his brother, the late Mr William Whitridge (Roberts), and including the late Mr Shirley Brooks, afterwards editor of *Punch*, amongst its contributors. In 1849 *Oswald's Well* was succeeded by the *Oswestry Advertizer*, which was established as a monthly publication, but under Mr. Roberts's enterprising management soon developed into a weekly, and from time to time was enlarged in size and extended in circulation until it became an influential newspaper for a wide-spread district in Shropshire and North Wales. It was in connection with the railway projects fought in the parliamentary committee rooms, a few years after the establishment of the *Advertizer*, that Mr Roberts, by his lively and trenchant style, first made the influence of the paper felt in the district now served by the Cambrian line, and some of our readers can remember the excitement that was caused week after week by the contributions which came from his pen. In 1860 he founded a second newspaper, the *Merionethshire Standard*, which afterwards became the *Cambrian News* ; and of this publication, as well as the *Advertizer*, he continued to be proprietor until, in 1868, he retired from business and sold the copyright to two of his old associates at the Caxton Press, by one of whom the paper in which these lines are written is still conducted. Mr Roberts was always an unflinching Liberal and Nonconformist, and no considerations of personal profit or loss were ever allowed to stand in the way of his constant advocacy of the principles in which he believed. He helped, not only by his writing, but by active work in some of the Welsh constituencies, to fight the battles which were carried on for years in North Wales, and which only ended in complete victory in the spring of 1880, though in Merionethshire he had the satisfaction of seeing his friend, Mr David Williams, elected as early as 1868. In the course of his journeys in the Principality, in connection, first with the railway projects, afterwards with these political contests, and finally with the "Gossiping Guide," Mr Askew Roberts made many friends and acquaintances, and some years ago there were few faces more familiar than his to the inhabitants of several Welsh counties. Of late, increasing ill-health has kept him more at home, but to the end he continued his acquaintance with a wide circle through the medium of the Press.

In 1871, Mr. Roberts, who took a keen and generous interest in the success of the *Advertizer* after it had passed into other hands, kindly offered to edit an antiquarian column, and the offer was gladly accepted. *Bye-Gones*, the first of many similar columns in other newspapers, began in October of that year, and soon made for itself a reputation amongst antiquaries which attracted contributors from various parts of the kingdom. The column was republished in quarterly parts, and Mr. Roberts never flagged, even when weakness almost incapacitated him from work, in his efforts to make the publication worthy of the position which it had won. The list of contributors contains the names of several well-known philologists and archaeologists ; and owners of ancient manuscripts, like the late Mr. Wynne of Peniarth aud the present Lord Harlech, from time to time gave Mr. Roberts their valuable assistance. His increasing interest in antiquarian pursuits led him to become a member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, where he made several fresh friends, with whom he kept up a correspondence until his death; and when the Shropshire Archaeological Society was formed, he was one of the first members, and was elected to a place on the Council. To the Transactions of the Shropshire Society he was a constant contributor, and papers from his pen also appeared in the Papers of the Powys-Land Club and in other antiquarian publications. It was through his friendship with the late Mr Wynne of Peniarth, we believe, that Mr Roberts was led to undertake the most important of his literary tasks, the issue of a new edition of the "History of the Gwydir Family," which appeared in 1878, in the shape of a handsome quarto, with several illustrations, and many annotations, chiefly from the pen of Mr Wynne. But it was in illustrating the history of his native town that Mr Roberts took the greatest delight, and the information which he has collected will be invaluable when a new History of Oswestry is written, as we hope it will be before very long. In 1881 he collected and published "Contributions to Oswestry History," a series of papers which he had written for the Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological Society; and it is only a few weeks ago since Mr Stanley Leighton, M.P., courteously acknowleiged the help which he had received from Mr Roberts in editing the Corporation Records. Mr Roberts was also the writer of "Wynnstay and the Wynns," published in 1876 ; he was engaged at one time to contribute letters on Wales to the well-known *Morning Star*, a London daily paper of former days ; and papers from his pen appeared in some of the London magazines.

It was, however, as the author of the "Gossiping Guide to Wales" that Mr Roberts was best known to the public. The first edition of that popular book was issued in 1870, under the title of "On and Off the Cambrian," and so successful did it prove that the scope of the work was gradually enlarged, until it became a complete guide to North Wales. The Press abounded with favourable notices, but it is only necessary to say that 50,000 copies of the Guide have been sold, to show how skilfully Mr Roberts did his work, and how well it was appreciated. In this publication also he was fortunate enough to secure the help of the late Mr Wynne, and of another well-known Welsh antiquary, the late Rev. R. Williams, at one time Rector of Rhydycroesau.

For some years Mr Roberts had not mixed much in public life, but in his younger days, when health and strength permitted, he took an active part in promoting the welfare of the town. He was a warm supporter of successive literary institutes, and he gave valuable help, years ago, in laying the foundation of the present Town Library. In 1865 he entered the Council, tying with another candidate at the head of the poll; but, believing perhaps that the position was not entirely compatible with his more important functions as a journalist and a critic, he retired in 1868. In the beginning of 1872 he was placed on the Commission of the Peace by Lord Chancellor Hatherley, and he devoted himself diligently to the duties of his office until he was incapacitated by illness.

At one time Mr Roberts was an active member of the Order of Free Masons. He was initiated into the Welshpool Lodge, No. 998, of Antient Free and Accepted Masons of England on March 30, 1864, and continued a member of that Lodge till December, 1867. In 1866 a petition was addressed to the Grand Master for a Lodge to be held at Oswestry, to be called the St. Oswald Lodge, and Mr Roberts was one of the ten petitioners, of whom only four are now alive. When the Lodge was consecrated, in October, 1866, Mr Roberts was chosen Secretary, and he continued to hold that office till October, 1870, when he became a Warden of the Lodge. On the 5th December, 1870, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, the R.W.P.G.M., appointed Mr Roberts a Steward of the Provincial Grand Lodge of North Wales and Shropshire.

Of Mr Roberts's character, it is difficult for one who enjoyed a life-long friendship with him to say much in these columns ; but we cannot close this brief record of his career without recalling his true kindness of heart, his delight in helping others, and a singular generosity of nature, which led him to rejoice in the success of his friends, and in the work of their hands or their brains, even more perhaps than in his own. In former days, when he conducted this paper, if he sometimes wrote with too keen a pen to please all readers, he was guided by a wholesome dislike of snobbery and pretence, a just regard for the honour and independence of the Press, and a fearless devotion to the cause of freedom and progress, which he did a good deal to help forward in less favoured times than these ; and while he frankly expressed his opinions, he never vilified his opponents or refused to recognize their merits, so that it is not surprising he should have won the lasting friendship of men who altogether differed with him in religious and political belief. For ourselves, we shall always miss the faithful friend and comrade of thirty years ; there are not a few who will cherish pleasant memories of his bright and genial companionship ; and there are some who can never forget his self-denying kindness, or the timely help which will make its influence felt through all their lives.

The remains of the deceased gentleman were interred in the Cemetry on Saturday afternoon. At two o'clock a large number of friends assembled at Croeswylan, and shortly afterwards the funeral procession was formed. The body, which was enclosed in a beautifully polished oak coffin, with brass furniture, was borne by employe's at the Caxon Press, and on the coffin were placed several beautiful wreaths, including one sent as a tribute of regard from the staff of the Caxton Press. The funeral procession was led by the officiating minister, the Rev. J. J. Poynter, and the Rev. E. M. Edmunds, and amongst those who were present were— Mr Benjamin Roberts, Mr W. H. Spaull, Mr T. Whitfield, Mr W. H. G. Weaver, Mr R. E. Hughes, Mr Hughes, Shrewsbury, Mr W. W. Coulson, Mr J. Cottam, the Rev. F. Cashel, Mr J. Conacher, Mr H. T. Wakelam, Mr Roe, Mr Williams, Post-office, Mr E. Edwards, Queen's-road, Mr Lloyd Wvnne Roberts, Mr John Evans, saddler, Mr J. Taylor, bootmaker, Mr R Jones, Welsh Walls, Mr Robert Lloyd, Mr David Vaughan, chemist, Mr Evan Watkins, Llanfyllin, Mr John Morris, Mr John Jones, Ashlands, Mr J. Jones, hatter, Mr Daniel, Mr C. H. Pugh, Mr Thomas Owen, Mr George Perks, Mr John Evans, Gobowen, Mr W. JacksoD, Queen's-road, Mr Crowther, Mr J. Elias, Mr H. Glascodine, Mr Corley, Mr Joseph Evans, Church-street, and the staff of the Caxton Press; and the following relatives :—Mr J. Whitridge Thomas, Master Northcote Thomas, Mr Thomas Minshall, Mr J. Parry-Jones, Mr S, Minshall, Mr E. Woodall, Mr J. Whitridge Davies, Mr Philip Minshall, Mr John Minshall, Mr I. F. Whitridge, Mr W. H. Lacon, Mr John Whitridge, and Mr Littlehales. The service, both in the chapel and at the grave, was conducted by the Rev. J. J. Poynter. Letters were received from friends in Welshpool, and other places, expressing their great regret that they were unable to ba present at the funeral. The shutters were up on many shops, and the blinds drawn down at many private houses in the town.

The *Oswestry Advertizer* in its leading columns says :—

Many of our readers on both sides of the Border will have heard with regret of the death of Mr. Askew Roberts, who conducted this paper for nearly twenty years, and in his retirement became the editor of *Bye-Gones*, Brief records of Mr. Roberts's life have appeared in many of the daily and weekly papers, and we give a longer sketch of his career in another column. Mr. Roberts will be remembered in Wales not only for his political services, which were considerable, but as the author of one of the most successful guides to the northern half of the country, and a writer who helped in many ways to preserve and illustrate the legends and records of the Principality. Mr. Roberts's public duties in his native town have been principally confined in later years to the discharge of magisterial duties, but he wrote so many authentic chapters of local history that, although he was not spared to weave them together, he may be justly called the historian of Oswestry.

The London Welsh correspondent of the *Oswestry Advertizer* makes the following references in his letter, to the death of Mr. Askew Roberts:— At the Executive Committee of the National Eisteddfod Association on Thursday evening, Mr J. H. Puleston, M.P., in the chair, deep regret was expressed by several of the members at the death of Mr Askew Roberts, who, since the formation of the Association, had been a member of the Executive, and who, in many ways, had largely contributed to its deliberations.

The announcement of Mr Askew Roberts's death has caused great sorrow amongst the London group of "Old Oswestrians." In many ways, notably in connection with the establishment of the pleasant Reunion of recent years, Mr Roberts had taken a warm and appreciative interest in their welfare. To not a few of them he had ever been a kind mentor and a wise friend, and his loss will be severely felt by them for many years to come. As the editor of "Bye-Gones" he was known to a much wider circle here. His faithfulness to the work he had taken up cannot be better illustrated than by the fact that only a few days before his death he wrote a long letter to Mr W. Charles Evans concerning the shield and arms of the Holbeach family, which Mr Evans had come across in Rochester Cathedral.

SHROPSHIRE FOLK-LORE.

The following interesting review of Part II. of Miss Burne's "Shropshire Folk-Lore" has appeared in the Saturday Review :— Inexperienced people might suppose that, the necessary materials being given, it would be easy to write an entertaining book on folk-lore ; but this is far from being the case. It is almost as difficult to make a book of folk-lore readable as a book of anecdotes or a book of jokes, and, at best, the folk-lore book is more useful as furnishing materials for historians, novelists, and poets, than as a book to be read at first hand by those who wish to be entertained. It is interesting enough to read of a local superstition, but a superstition with variations soon becomes wearisome. Yet the faithful compiler of a work on folk-lore is obliged to explain that in one part of the country it is considered unlucky to see one magpie, while in another it is unlucky to see two ; that in some places three, and in others four, foretell the birth of a boy ; that four augur a wedding, according to certain authorities, and a death according to others, and that it is a question whether all these prognostications are not upset by a wise saying which begins "One for anger, two for luck," and so on. Furthermore he has to state that there are experts who consider the superstitions about magpies equally applicable to crows. Of this sort of reading it is possible to have too much ; but the unlucky folk-lore-monger is bound to produce every variety of his wares, unless he wishes to hear his work called incomplete. The merciful critic is inclined, therefore, to take up a book of folk-lore with feelings of charitable pity for its author. He would be even more sorry for himself if he thought he were going to read it through; but of doing this he rarely has any intention, as a book of folk-lore is easily reviewed by a little dipping and a good deal of skipping. The author of the specimen before us, however, has done her work so well that she has no need to ask mercy from her critics, and her reviewer who comes to skip will stay to read.

...


[p210-11]

Miss Burne observes that Shropshire people still have a superstition that the croaking of a raven portends death, particularly if the raven flies over a house. She would have been confirmed in her opinion if she had heard an old Shropshire servant consoling her invalid master, with whom she was sitting up one night, by informing him that he would soon be in heaven because on the previous day she had heard a raven crying "corpse, corpse," as it flew over the house. The greater part of the folk-lore collected in this volume is connected with deaths, diseases, and weddings. With regard to the former, there is certainly no exaggeration in the remark that "thirty or forty years ago it was no very uncommon thing among the more ignorant folk to take the pillow from under a sick person's head (after the fashion of Mrs Gamp) 'to make him die the easier.'" The thirty or forty years might have been left out, and, unless we have been greatly misinformed, the pillow has not only been taken from under a sick Salopian's head, but held tightly over it afterwards, with the laudable intention of "helping him to die." Those who have had much to do with the Shropshire poor will not be altogether disinclined to believe a story given in a foot-note which might try the credulity of the inhabitants of other counties. "An old man at Baschurch," we are told, had been " very ill, but in no immediate danger of death." The curate was, therefore, rather surprised one day at finding the patient dead ; but his affectionate widow volunteered the following account of his demise :— "He tried so hard, but he couldna die ; he tried an' tried, but he couldna, so I got a piece o' tape an' put it roun' his neck an' drawed it tight, an' he went off like a lamb." A Shropshire rector once told us that he had called on a dying parishioner, and had scarcely begun a conversation with him when his wife begged him to talk to her instead, saying to her husband, " Now don't you waste your time talking ; you get on with your dying."

...

Miss Burne's book on the folk-lore of Shropshire would not have been complete if she had made no mention of the tradition of the Sin-eater— a poor man who, for a small consideration, is said to have been ready to take upon himself the responsibility of all the sins of any dead person; but she very properly adds that the authorities in support of this tradition are somewhat questionable. Shropshire and Welsh archaeologists have fiercely contested the question whether any such custom ever existed, and antiquaries must be content to leave the matter open.

Miss Burne very often quotes and refers to a work called *Bye-Gones*, which was edited by Mr Askew Roberts, "than whom," she tells us, "few men could be more respected in life or regretted in death." This book consists simply of reprints from a column devoted to notes, queries, and replies about folk-lore in the *Oswestry Advertizer*, a cleverly edited Liberal newspaper, well known in Shropshire and North Wales. The example set in this respect by the *Oswestry Advertizer* is well worthy of imitation by other local newspapers, for *Bye-Gones*, of which there are now many volumes, is itself a very valuable book of folk-lore, and if in every county in England the editor of a newspaper would employ somebody on a work of this kind, an immense amount of interesting and valuable information might be amassed. There are other books besides *Bye-Gones* and her other quoted authorities which we think Miss Burne might have found useful and so many local customs owe their origin to religious rites and uses of pre-Reformation periods that she would have done well to have had by her a good work on ecclesiastical customs and popular religious practices, subjects with which she does not seem familiar. We wish, too, that she had had the opportunities—opportunities hard to get—of learning the private ghost-stories of the Shropshire country houses; for the county is rich in such legends, but its inhabitants are very reticent in communicating them to strangers.

Much of the folk-lore attributed here to Shropshire is common to other counties ; but it would be impossible to sift out what is exclusively Salopian. Such customs as the giving back of a small sum on a purchase for luck, pinching for new clothes, decorating churches, and the observance of May Day, are equally well known in other parts of England, and many of the superstitions noticed in this volume must be familiar to every body; but upon the whole this second part of Miss Burne's work is written with great ability; it ought to find a place in every library in Shropshire, whether public or private, and an inhabitant of any English county would be hard to please if he could not find a good deal in it both to amuse and interest him. A third part has yet to be published treating of several important subjects connected with folk-lore. We are also promised some addenda and corrigenda, and, best of all, an index— a most important matter in a work of this kind. Miss Burne apologizes for the delay in the appearance of the second part; but, as she herself admits, "the work has gained thereby," for when a well-disposed antiquary reads a book about the folk-lore of his own neighbourhood, he is tempted to send some additional information to the writer, and he generally yields to this temptation. Our advice, therefore, to the author of *Shropshire Folk-lore* is not to be in a hurry about publishing the third part.

THE ASKEW ROBERTS MEMORIAL AT OSWESTRY. The ceremony of handing over the Askew Roberts Memorial Clock to the town of Oswestry was performed at a quarter to five yesterday afternoon, when the Mayor and Corporation attended at the Post Office to receive it. There were several prominent ratepayers present, in addition to the Mayor, Mr W. H. Spaull (secretary to the Memorial Fund), and the Town Clerk, Mr J. Parry-Jones, The proceedings were opened by Mr Spaull, who said they were met together to ask the Mayor to accept from the subscribers, for the use of the inhabitants of the borough of Oswestry, the clock which was placed by public subscription outside the Post Office, and which was to be removed wherever the Post Office was removed to. The clock was put up as a memorial to a late townsman, Mr Askew Roberts, who was a man of some little note in the literary world, but the Town Clerk would no doubt refer to Mr Roberts's qualities at greater length. He had received a letter from the Post Office authorities, accepting the responsibility of the care and repair of the clock. He also held in his hand a letter from the local postmaster, stating that the clock put up by Messrs Joyce of Whitchurch was at the time in good order and keeping very regular time, varying not more than half a minute in a fortnight. He begged to ask the Mayor, as the representative of the Town Council and of the burgesses of the borough, to accept the clock on behalf of the inhabitants. (Hear, hear, and applause.)

Mr J. Parry-Jones said as executor to the late Mr Askew Roberts he had been asked to be present, and had very great pleasure in representing the family. It was with great pleasure they saw that the townspeople and the inhabitants of the place Mr Roberts loved so well were still desirous of perpetuating his memory. Oswestry had not connected with it the names of a great many memorable persons and it was desirable that the memory of a man like Mr Askew Roberts, who had done so much for his native town, should not pass away without recognition. He was the author of the "Gossiping Guide to Wales," which had created so much interest in North Wales, and which her Majesty the Queen was so much pleased to receive on her visit to Wales, and the originator of *Bye-Gones*, which had done so much to create an interest in the subject of folk-lore and antiquarian research in local matters. He believed Mr Askew Roberts was the originator of these local "Notes and Queries," and that *Bye-Gones* was the first periodical of the kind, perhaps, in all England, and his memory, if for nothing else than this, deserved to be perpetuated. They were all aware of the interest, he might say the passionate interest, with which he regarded his native town, and therefore it was fitting that his memory should be commemorated by the inhabitants of the town he loved so well. (Applause.)

The Mayor, who was received with applause, said as Mayor, as a ratepayer of the town, and as one first came into Oswestry while the late Mr Askew Roberts was still taking an active interest in the town, he had great pleasure in accepting the clock, to be held in trust for the town and as the property thereof. It would remain on the site of the present Post-office, and be removed to wherever the Post-office might be removed in the course of events. (Hear, hear.) It was not only most useful, but it would commemorate the memory oi one who did his very best for the town while he lived in it and whose memory would linger long in the places where he worked so well. (Hear, hear.) There was an old inscription in the purlieus of the Temple, over the sun dial, which he remembered having seen, "Shadows we are and like shadows depart." Thinking of those lines they might remember that those who had gone before them, and done a good work, not only deserved to have their memories regarded by those who remained, but they should endeavour to follow in the footsteps which they had planted before them. (Applause.) The clock would now be in the safe keeping of the Mayors who would succeed him, and he hoped all would profit by the good time which they were told it kept. (Loud cheers.)

The first turn to the left leads up the quaint street called the Double Butcher Row ; the next, a little further down the Hill, takes us past some fine half-timbered buildings (" Ireland's Mansion " on the right) to The Square, with the picturesque Market House of the 16th century, one of the finest buildings of the kind to be seen in the country. It is said that at one time the hall was rented by the Company of Drapers, who there bought flannel which had been brought to the town by Welsh weavers, and, according to a local legend, the mode of purchase was novel— and profitable. "A drum revolving on an axle was used for measuring the flannel. This drum, exactly a yard in circumference, was turned by a handle, and each revolution of the handle was counted as a yard, without any consideration for the gradual increase in the diameter of the drum by the successive folds of the article measured thereon." According to the story, the Welshmen were not astute enough to discover the fraud for some time, but when they found it out they deserted Shrewsbury market, and so it came to pass that the trade in Welsh flannel was extinguished).

THE CYMMRODORION SOCIETY.

MR E. SIDNEY HARTLAND ON THE "SIN-EATER"

The second lecture of the Cymmrodorion Session was given at a joint meeting of the Cymmrodorion and Folk-Lore Societies, which was held on Wednesday, the 10th February, at the rooms of the Royal Asiatic Society in Albemarle-street, under the presidency of Professor Rhys, when Mr E. Sidney Hartland, of Gloucester, who is an active member of both Societies, and the author of "The Science of Fairy Tales," read a paper on "The Sin-Eater." Amongst others present there were :— Mr Henry Owen, F.S.A., Mr G. Lawrence Gomme, Mr Alfred Nutt, Mr T. Marchant Williams, Mr Edward Clodd, Dr Karl Blind, Dr Gaster, Mr Sydenham Jones, Mr D. McRitchie, Mr F. A. Milne (secretary to the Folk-Lore Society), Mr E. Vincent Evans (secretary to the Cymmrodorion Society),&c, &c— The Chairman, after a brief reference to Mr Hartland's contributions to the study of folk-lore, called upon him to read his paper on "The Sin- Eater."— The earliest mention of the curious custom of the Sin-Eater, formerly observed in Wales and the Welsh Marches at funerals, is to be found, according to Mr Hartland, in "The Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme," a work of John Aubrey, (1686-7) which remained in MS. for 200 years, until it was for the first time issued by the Folk-Lore Society in 1881. The passage in question (p. 23-4) runs as follows :— "*Offertories at Funeralls.*— These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye ch. of Engl. Common-Prayer-booke : but I never sawe it used, but once, at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the Counties of North-Wales. But before when the Corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingravred on it, and ye parties name deceased, w'ch one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps; and this Custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales." On this there is the following note by Bishop Kennett:—" where a small tablet or board is fixt near the Altar, upon w'ch the friends of ye defunct lay their offerings in mony according to their own ability and the quality of the person deceased.... *Sinne-Eaters*.— It seems a remainder of this custom w'ch lately obtained at Amersden `[(1) Ambrosden (near Bicester, Oxon.), of which parish Kennett was vicar 1684-1691]` in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment were brought to the minister in the Ch, porch." Aubrey also has (p. 35-6) the following note on "Sinne-Eaters:— In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to { hire | have } poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere; a Loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, w'ch he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (me-thinkes) something to the Scape-goate in ye old Lawe... This custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was { observed | continued } even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian government : as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish,the { kinred | relations} of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this Countie ; as also in Brecon, e.g., at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custome was heretofore used over all Wales..... In North-Wales, the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of ; but there, insted of a Bowle of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke. Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England till the Civil-warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good Beer.—Cramer." Ellis (in Brand and Ellis's "Observations on Popular Antiquities," ed. 1813, ii., 155), who quotes Aubrey from this MS., also reprints from Leland's *Collectanea*, vol. i., p. lxxvi., the following passage of Mr John Bagford's *Letter relating to the Antiquities of London* (dated Feb. 1, 1714-5), giving a slightly varied account, also professedly derived from Aubrey.

"Within the memory of our Fathers in Shropshire, in those Villages adjoyning to Wales, when a Person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire (for so they call'd him), who presently repair'd to the Place where the deceased lay, and stood before the Door of the House, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his pocket; a Crust of Bread, which he eat; and a full Bowle of Ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the Cricket, and pronounced with a composed Gesture, *The ease and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul*. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious Observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr Churchhill the Bookseller."

The only other mention of the custom of the Sin-Eater, of any importance, is that made by the late Mr Mathew Moggridge of Swansea at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852. His account was that "when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received his fee of 2s 6d, and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze ; for, as it was believed that he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood—regarded as a mere Pariah—as one irremediably lost." Mr Moggridge specified the parish of Llandebie, Carmarthenshire, about twelve or thirteen miles N. of Swansea, as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period. (*Arch. Camb.* for 1852, 2nd Series, vol. ii. pp. 330-2).

So far as Mr Hartland was aware, no explanation of this strange custom had been hitherto offered beyond Aubrey's conjecture that it had some reference to the Hebrew scapegoat. He (Mr Hartland) proposed to compare it with one or two other customs in this country and abroad, for the purpose, if possible, of tracing its origin. He assumed that in the custom described we have only a mutilated form of the original ceremony. Ths first point to be noted was that the rite had to do with the disposal of the dead, that the eating of food placed upon the coffin.or rather upon the body itself, was the substance of the rite, and that the belief connected with it was that by the act of eating some properties of the dead were taken over by the eater. Mr Hartland then proceeded to look for analogies, and described a custom, formerly prevalent in the highlands of Bavaria, of eating Corpse-cakes [i.e., cakes prepared from dough placed to rise on the enshrouded dead body, and afterwards baked], to which the belief attached that they contained the virtues of the departed, which virtues passed over by means of the Corpse-cakes into the kinsmen who consumed them, and so were retained within the kindred. A Dyak funeral rite in which food was placed before the dead ere the coffin was closed, to be afterwards devoured by the nearest relations of the departed, was next described ; then a curious custom in the Scottish Lowlands, called the dishaloof, in which salt played a prominent part. All these customs were pronounced to be more archaic and therefore more significant in form than the custom of doles of money and food at funerals, which was identified in the passages quoted from Aubrey, as well as by more recent writers, as a survival of the Sin-Eater. That this identification is substantially correct will be seen not only from the instances already given, but also from Pennant's statement (*Tours in Wales*, ed. 1883, iii, 150-1) that in Wales, previously to a funeral, it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house, for the next of kin (a female) to give over the coffin a quantity of white loaves, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor people. After that they presented in like manner a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it immediately; then the minister repeated the Lord's prayer, after which they proceeded with the corpse. To this hour, Pennant adds, the bier is carried by the next of kin, a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased. It is not at all uncommon, as folk-lore students are aware, for tribal, communal, and other feasts in the last stage of their decadence to come to be represented by gifts of food to the poor. The significance of the custom as related by Pennant is that the food and drink are given *across the coffin by the next of kin*,* and that if the recipients are not required to eat the bread on the spot they have at least to drink of the liquor offered them. Mr Hartland cited many variants of this custom in this and other countries. When these traditional observances are set side by side, their meaning, he observed, is transparent. The partaking of food and drink which have been placed upon or near the body or the coffin of the deceased, or are delivered over the coffin to be consumed— an act, in the most elaborate of these rites, distinctly believed to convey to the persons who partake some, at all events, of the properties of the dead— can only be a relic of a savage feast where the meat consumed was the very body of the deceased kinsman. The eating of the dead, however repulsive to us, is known by the testimony of ancient writers to have been the practice of many barbarous tribes, and travellers have found it among modern savages. In particular Strabo records it of the ancient Irish. The inference that the cannibalism related of them was once common to those peoples among whom similar modern practices, like those of the Sin-Eater, &c, have been found, is well within the limits of induction. The reason for the custom is doubtless to be found in the belief that the qualities of the food are communicated to the eater. The same reason which induces the wild South American warrior to love the flesh of tigers, &c, because from it courage passes into those who eat thereof, leads the Bavarian peasant to retain within the kindred the good qualities of a departed member by means of the symbolical act of eating "corpse-cakes." In the Sin-Eater the same act is put to another, but strictly analogous, use in the absorption of the sins of the dead. Why it was supposed that in the one case good and in the other evil properties were communicated we do not know. Some variation in the view taken of the matter by the clergy may have led to the rite being considered disgraceful in Wales, and so may have rendered those who persisted in it the objects of persecution. Payment to undertake the odium, the consequent degradation as well of the rite as of the person who performed it, and the influence of the Biblical account of the Hebrew Scapegoat.may have done the rest. The gifts of food to the poor, both in their immediate form described by Pennant, and in their final form as doles, however, point to a different interpretation of the same original observance. They can hardly be derived from the Sin-Eater; their relation to it is not lineal but collateral. They are variants of the ceremony, and variants bearing the strongest testimony to the form and meaning of the parent type.— Mr Hartland's paper was most cordially received by the company, but various points were more or less criticised by the members of both Societies. The theory set forth is undoubtedly an ingenious one, but it requires further proofs to make it altogether acceptable. So far as Wales is concerned there existed up to a very recent period some very curious funeral customs, the recital of which might throw further light on the custom of the Sin-Eater. We would suggest that persons cognisant of the customs referred to should forward their information either direct to Mr Sydney Hartland, at Barnwood Court, Gloucester (who we are sure will make the best possible use of all bits of Welsh Folk-Lore sent to him), or contribute it to the congenial columns of Bye-Gones for the edification and enlightenment of the public.

FUNERAL CUSTOM IN SHROPSHIRE.

The current number of *Folk-Lore* contains the following letter signed Gertrude Hope, and dated July 27, 1893:— "In connection with Mr Hartland's article on 'The Sin-Eater' in Folk-Lore for June, 1892, the following occurrence at a funeral near Market Drayton in Shropshire may interest you. The funeral took place on the first of this present month. The minister of the chapel where the deceased woman had been a regular attendant held a short service in the cottage before the coffin was removed. The lady, who gave me the particulars, arrived rather early, and found the bearers enjoying a good lunch in the only downstairs room. Shortly afterwards the coffin was brought down and placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, and the mourners having gathered round it the service proceeded. Directly the minister ended, the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present across the coffin, with a biscuit called a 'funeral biscuit.' One of the bearers being absent at the moment, the fourth glass of wine and biscuit were offered to the eldest son of the deceased woman, who, however, refused to take them, and was not obliged to do so. The biscuits were ordinary sponge biscuits, usually called "sponge fingers" or "lady's fingers." They are, however, also known in the shops of Market Drayton as "funeral biscuits." The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been." Ed.

LLANYBLODWEL WAKES.

The wakes in the parish of Llanyblodwel are, or rather were, held the first Sunday after the 10th of October. This would be this year on the 15th of October. As the church is dedicated to St. Michael, whose day was the 29th of September, we have in the observance of the wakes in this parish an instance of the people's clinging to the Old Style, and refusing the New, or Gregorian Style, which caused eleven days to be thrown out of the year in 1752, September 3rd being reckoned as September 14th, and therefore, according to the Old Style, St. Michael's Day would be on October 10th, and the Sunday in the octave would be October 15th, so the people in this parish, by ignoring the new arrangement of time, and by clinging to the old time of observing the wakes, only perpetuate an ancient custom. It would be curious information to ascertain if any other parish adheres to the Old Style. In this parish it is also the custom to hold a vestry during the octave of the Saint's Day, beginning the 10th of October, and this year, as usual, this vestry was held October 18th, one part of the business being the reading and passing of the churchwardens' accounts. In this way the church year ends with St. Michael's Day. In most parishes Easter is the time to audit the churchwardens' accounts. It would be well to ascertain if there are other parishes where the year corresponds with the saint's year. The observance of the wakes in Llanyblodwel parish had one peculiarity. The cottagers were in the habit of going with a good-sized tin can from farmhouse to farm house to beg for milk, to make a pudding with against the Sunday next after October 10th. They started before break of day, as early as 5 30 a.m., on Saturday morning, and as' long as : the [skim milk lasted in the farms each comer received a certain quantity of milk— no one was turned away empty. Preparation was made for this distribution, and oft times all the skim milk of the night before was given away to the cottagers. The pudding making proceeded far into the night, and there was, a kind of clubbing together to heat the big oven, and all the neighbours took their rice puddings to this oven to be baked, and spent the time jollily together until the pudding was ready to be taken away. The custom still lingers, but the glory has,departed, and but few in our days trouble the farmer's wife for milk at break of day. E.O.

REPLIES. FUNERAL CUSTOM IN SHROPSHIRE (Oct. 11, 1893).

The custom looks very much like "Cwrw poeth a theisenau," which was practised at Welsh funerals as late as nearly the middle of this century. I do not know the beginning of the custom. I once witnessed it at Cefn Mawr, in the parish of Ruabon. A small glass of hot beer was handed round from a quart jug with a small cake to all present, about twenty. The funeral was that of a native of Llandegla, if I remember rightly, and she was very old. The attendants handed the beer. Llangwm. Ellis Roberts.

SMOKING IN CHURCH.— The following appears in the Times of Friday last: Mr Ede's reference to the sin-eater will be explained by a letter which we publish in another column :— Mr Elton B. Ede writes from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing:— Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice—namely, smoking in church—which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverence. I have not seen this practice mentioned in anv book, and though it is not desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten. Some of the readers of Bye-Gones can carry their memories back to 1850. Can they confirm this ? W.O.

THE STORY OF THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

At the meeting of the British Association, Anthropology Section, on Saturday week, Mr E. S. Hartland, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism, said the earliest form of cannibalism was that of the eating of deceased relatives. The practice extended over the greater part of the world, and many people would be surprised to learn that traces of it were to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own islands. Not very long ago, in Upper Bavaria, when a man died and had been laid out, a cake was made of ordinary flour. The corpse was placed before the fire, and this cake, called the corpse cake, was put upon its breast to rise. The dough, in rising, was believed to absorb all the virtues of the deceased, and the cake was afterwards eaten by his nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peninsula an edible image of the dead was carried in the funeral procession. When the body was buried the mourners ate this image above the grave, saying as they did so, "God rest him." In Wales the practice of employing a "sin-eater" had only ceased within the memory of men still living. It was the custom for the nearest relative, usually a woman, to hand across the bier, or place upon the breast of the corpse, bread, cheese, and beer, which were eaten by the sin-eater, who pronounced everlasting rest to the departed. It was believed that the sin-eater by this means appropriated to himself all the sins which the deceased had committed during his lifetime.

The Times of Wednesday contained the following letter from Mr N. W. Thomas of Oswestry :— " In your issue of Monday Mr E. S. Hartland is reported to have said, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism in the Anthropological Section of the British Association, that the sin-eater has only disappeared from Wales within living memory. If, as I imagine, Mr Hartland's evidence for this survival is presented to us in his article on the subject in *Folklore* for June, 1892, I venture to think it is wholly insufficient. Mr Hartland's words are (p. 148), 'Mr Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie. . . as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period.' These words are a paraphrase from the report of the Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol. III., N.S., p. 330. The exact words used by Mr Moggridge are as follows:— 'There (near Llandebie) the above practice (of the sin-eater) was said to have prevailed to a recent period.' This evidence is originally at best second hand; it is unfortunate that Mr Hartland has emphasized its value; in the article in *Folklore* Mr Moggridge's evidence has the appearance of being the result of personal observation. Thus at the outset Mr Hartland's evidence is weakened. But to any one who has considered the discussion in the *Academy* in the winter of 1875-76 it seems quite incredible that Mr Moggridge's evidence should be quoted at all. Canon Silvan Evans collected the evidence on the question. Among others, the vicar of the parish and the schoolmaster testified to the non-existence of the superstition. The vicar quoted an intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in the parish. He said that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have appeared for the last 200 years, or he would have heard of it from his father or grandfather, who lived to a great age. The vicar concluded that the statements which were made by Mr Moggridge could not be substantiated by any reliable evidence. The schoolmaster, Mr John Rowland, who lived in Llandebie in 1852, when Mr Moggridge spoke, was equally emphatic. He said he knew all the parishioners and the history of the parish, its customs, legends, and traditions, and during the time he was there he attended many funerals, but never heard of a sin-eater ; in fact, people never gave cakes at funerals in Llandebie. Is it possible that Mr Hartland has never seen this discussion, or has he ignored it? In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to assert that the sin-eater was known within living memory in the locality named. In addition to this, in February, 1882, the Rev T. Eynon Davies published a letter in the *Christian World* à propos of Payton Hood's 'Christmas Evans.' Mr Davies was Congregational minister in Cwmaman, near Llandebie, and said, "Some octogenarians whom I have questioned have never seen a sin-eater, neither have they heard their parents or their grandparents refer to this custom.' There is, in fact, no evidence that he ever existed in Wales at all. All the stories go back to Aubrey's 'lean, long, ugly, lamentable, poor Raskel'; and he was at Ross, in Herefordshire, if we believe Aubrey, none too strong a witness. If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the 'sin-eater' in modern times, stamped originally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, sealed thirty years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association. Even the Celtic fringe does not deserve this treatment."

The subject was dealt with in *Bye-Gones* for 1874-5 and 1876-7, where much of the correspondence in the *Academy* was reproduced.

The following letter has also appeared in *The Times*:—

Sir,— Amid the hurry of the concluding meetings of the British Association I did not see Mr Thomas's letter in your issue of Wednesday last; and it is only to-day that I have had an opportunity of reading it. I am much obliged to him for calling my attention to the fact that the existence of the Sin-Eater in Wales has been questioned. I gather that he is a reader of *Folklore*. Had he challenged the statements in my article when it was published there I should have been doubly grateful, since my only object is to elicit and preserve the truth : assuredly not to cast any imputation upon Welshmen. I have never seen the discussion in the *Academy*, nor Mr Eynon Davies's letter in the *Christian World*, to which Mr Thomas refers ; nor have I until now ever heard of any doubt being thrown upon the matter.

Unfortunately I have no access here to the old numbers of the *Academy*. Will Mr Thomas kindly add to my obligation by lending me those containing the discussion on the Sin-Eater, if he has copies of them? Meantime I reserve all observations upon the evidence until I have seen them.— I am, &c.,

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

Mr E. Sidney Hartland.writing from Highgarth, Gloucester, to the Times, says:— "Your correspondent, Mr N. W. Thomas, denies the existence of the sin-eater in Wales, basing his denial on the statements of Canon Silvan Evans in the Academy twenty years ago and of the Rev T. Eynon Da vies in the Christian World of February, 1882. By the courtesy of Mr Thomas and Mr Woodall I have now been furnished with the correspondence containing these statements. " I will deal with the negative evidence presently. Let us first see what positive evidence of the existence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey. This is true.in the sense that Aubrey is the earliest writer to mention the custom and that he gives the fullest account of it. I do not know what grounds Mr Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey's testimony. He was a careful and enlightened inquirer into old customs ; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open; his bona fides is not to be questioned ; and his description of the ceremony and the expressions he makes use of testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statement than casual gossip. He gives specific instances of sin-eating,not merely at Ross, as Mr Thomas says, but also at Dynder, at Hereford, and at Llangors, in Brecknockshire, with particulars as to each. He does not, indeed, Jrofess to have himself witnessed these instances, f we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye-witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to

historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt. But he does seem to have witnessed it, or a ceremony similar to it in all points except the utterance of the ritual words, at Beaumaris or elsewhere in North Wales. Speaking of offertories at funerals he says ('Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme,' page 23):—* These are mentioned in the Kubrick of y9 Ch. of Engl. .Comon-Prayer booke : but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese, and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with y9 Anno Dni ingraved on it, & y9 parties name deceased, weh one accepts of on the other side of y9 corps; and this custome is used to this day, 1686, in North Wales.' Whether we are to understand that Aubrey saw this himself or not, it is clear that he made minute inquiries. A century later Pennant describes the same custom (' Tour in Wales,' ed. 1783, Vol. III., page 150). Pennant was born and lived in Wales; and we must suppose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours ana friends, if he had not himself witnessed it. " Coming down to a more recent date, Miss Gertrude Hope, writing in Folklore (Vol. IV., page 392), describes the same ceremony as performed at Market Drayton as lately as the 1st of July, 1893. The details were given to her by an eye-witness, and she significantly adds :—' The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been.' If necessary, I could give other cases from Shropshire; and I ought not to leave quite unmentioned the superstition still current in Derbyshire.among a population probably still to a large extent of Celtic ancestry, that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, in accordance with which belief wine is handed round first to the bearers and afterwards to the guests (See S. O. Addy, «Household Tales,' 1893, pages 123,124). Mr Thomas may, however, deny the relevancy of these; and considerations of space prevent my arguing the question at length here. " Confining myself,therefore,to Wales, I observe that we have explicit assertions, not merely by Aubrey, but also by Pennant, as well as the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie down to a few years before 1852, when his paper was written. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us.found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited; but in deference to them it is probable that in many places a compromise would be adopted. The acts would be retained, the words interpreting and completing them would be dropped. " Now, what is the negative evidence ? It amounts to this :— "1. Canon Silvan Evans, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folk lore, never found a trace of the custom, nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature. " 2. He made inquiries of the vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr Rowland,the schoolmaster, denied the existence of the practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish of whom the vicar inquired also denied it. " 3. The RevT. Eynon Davies aho denied it in reference to Cwmamman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the statements of octogenarians. " None of these denials can outweigh the positive statements already cited. The custom certainly existed entire in the 17th century at Llangors. Shorn of the ritual words, it maintained itself into the 18th century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembroke- shire._ We may be sure it did not maintain itself only in these places, especially having regard to the practices at Market Drayton and in Derbyshire. It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans's inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeed, was, we are told, an old resident; but the clergymau had only been vicar for fourteen years, though he described himself as having known the neighbourhood well for twenty-five years, which may mean much or little. We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference. In any case they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition, if it existed. The Rev Elias Owen, Diocesan Inspector of Schools and one of the chief authorities on Welsh folklore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitious of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse, ' Our people are not superstitious, I am glad to say.' His inspection over, he asked the first class, ' Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a buggan (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of any one who has seen one?' Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is, the people hide their superstitions from all such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommoi exoerience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev C. P. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel' witch-burning' case, is express, and is.
of the greatest weight on this point. The reason of the concealment comes out in his evidence. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages as the priest or the minister to the ancient superstitions. " On the whole, then, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognized bv every one), his denials and the results of his inquiries dp not countervail the positive evidence of the existence of the sin-eater in Wales; and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev Eynou Davies, whose inquiries were made later still. I have confined mvself to the hare question of fact, and have given little more than an outline of the arguments which T could adduce if I had space for them. The rite is discussed at length in the second volume of my "Legend of Perseus,' just published by Mr David Nutt. Could I have advanced here the considerations there brought forward, I venture to think they would have strongly supported my con- clusion.# I fear that, consciously or unconsciously, the denial has its roots in a mistaken national or local patriotism, which perhaps peeps forth in Mr Thomas's vehemence and in his allusion to the ' Celtic fringe.' We are accustomed to this sort of thing among the Irish, who so greatly resent Giraldus Cambrensis's account of their forefathers (in the main, I believe, perfectly true) that they call any daring lie _' a Giraldus.' It is fair, however, to Canon Silvan Evans to pay that he entirely disclaims this very natural feeling,puttinsr the question purely as one of alleged matter of fact. My own numerous Welsh friends will not suspect me of any antipathv to their nation, or any desire to wound their susceptibilities in declining to accept Mr Thomas's verdict. I regard the sin-eater only as an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity; and the last thing I should dream of would be to make its possession the basis of any imputation against Wales or the Welsh. "I have written without reference to the account in The Mountain Decameron mentioned bv your correspendent' Z.' because I have not seen that book. It is probably the nameless authority recently cited by a contributor to the Western Mail. If so, and if the account be authentic (as to which I can offer no opinion), the performance of the ceremony at night, as there described, would explain why the custom in some places eluded clerical notice." Writing on October 15th to the Times, Mr F. J. Warren (Gwynfardd Dyfed), the contributor to the Western Mail referred to by Mr Hartland, gives the following references : — " Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales : With the Scenery of the River Wye," by Thomas Roscoe, Esq. published in 1854 by Mr Henry G. Bohn, York-street, Covent Garden, also "Cymni Fu—Notes and Queries Relating to the past History of Wales and the Border Counties," published in 1888 by Messrs T^aniel Owen and Co., Ltd., of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In the notes in " Cymru Fu " the writers on this subject in turn draw their information from "Paxton Hood's Christmas Evans," and from " Blackwood" (November, 1875).

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

The following letter appeared in the Times of October 28.

Sir,— Mr Hartland's letter raises several very interesting points which would require to be discussed at some length. I must, however, confine myself to the question mainly raised by my first letter— the evidence for the recent existence of the sin-eater.

As I should explain, did space permit, I do not regard analogical evidence as very satisfactory,for two reasons— (1) Aubrey may have misinterpreted a ceremony which he saw (he does not tell us that the name sin-eater was used, I think); (2) the sin- eater, if he existed, may not unreasonably be regarded as the result of a misunderstanding of other customs.

The evidence for the recent existence in Wales of this personage is the evidence of Mr Moggridge — a story related by him at Ludlow, and derived no one knows where, at least second hand, perhaps third, fourth, or fifth hand.

Against this we have the evidence of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the Nonconformist minister — no doubt such a conjunction is enough to damn any cause; but we must remember that the school-master was no tyro at folklore, he had collected legends and customs for Sir Thomas Philipps. Even a clergyman and a diocesan inspector can elicit ghost stories in a strange parish. Much more can a local schoolmaster find a sin-eater.

Secondly, no Welsh writer has ever mentioned the sin-eater, and no Welsh word for the same is known.

Thirdly, no one has ever been produced who saw a sin-eater or heard of him in the localities where he was said to have lived. Even if I accepted Mr Hartland's canon of evidence I should not think that probability lay on his side. Holding that folklore requires stricter evidence of customs, which an eye-witness might readily misinterpret, I hold to my position that the sin-eater has not existed in Wales in recent times. — I am, &c, N. W. Thomas. New College, Eastbourne. 

[The *Times* declined to publish a fuller reply to Mr Hartland, on the ground that the subject was not of sufficient general interest. –Ed.]

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

I do not know whether the following will throw any light on the question of "The Sin-Eater in Wales," which has again come up for discussion :— A few months ago, six or so, I was present at the funeral of a member of one of the old-inhabitant families of Bettws-Cedewain. After the corpse was placed outside the door, and before the performance of the religious service, a small piece of cake was given, first to the bearers (but whether across the corpse or not I cannot now recollect),and afterwards to each of the guests. Next a glass of wine was handed to each one in the same order. I believe the custom was general in this district twenty or thirty years ago, but I have seen only one other instance of its observance within the last five years. I have never heard any ritual used. T.H.J.

THE SIN EATER.— A good deal of discussion has been going on in the *Times*, the *Academy*, and elsewhere as to the alleged Welsh Sin Eater, and Mr Hartland, who believes in him, supports his case by referring to the custom of dispensing cakes and drink at funerals. Has it ever been suggested, in this controversy, that the custom is probably a survival of the tribal custom mentioned by Mr Seebohm in his lecture on "The Historical Importance of the Cymric Tribal System ?"

In the laws of Manu we have exactly the same division of kindred : those who are within the fourth degree of kindred are those relatives who are bound to give the cake at the tomb or rather at the hearth where the spirits of the ancestors were supposed to reside, and that giving of the cake was as it were at the root of the extreme care which they gave to the observance of the degrees of kindred; those who were beyond the fourth were not quite free, they had to give only water and not the cake.

The custom would take a different shape in course of time, and wine might easily be substituted for water. It is significant that the "next of kin " gave white loaves over the coffin. Perhaps the Pembrokeshire minister mentioned by Mr Hartland in the *Academy* was nearer the truth than he supposed when he said he was sorry to see "that Pagan custom " still observed. W.O.

REPLIES.

THE SIN-EATER (Sept. 2, 1896).— The custom alluded to by Mr Seebohm is plainly connected with the worship of ancestors ; the cake was offered to them by males to the fourth degree of kindred. It does not seem possible to connect an *offering* at the hearth with the *meal* which is the central point of the sin-eater ritual. N.W.T.

It is too long to transcribe into this column, but in that case a stranger was got hold of who had to eat a bit of saffron cake which lay on the dead man's breast and to drink from a bowl of spirits passed across the coffin. When he had done, all present raised a cry and threw at him sticks, cinders, and whatever they could lay hold of, and hustled him on all sides, and thrust him out of doors with the cry, "He has taken on him the sins o' the dead, Cast'm out."

NOTICES OF BOOKS. Archceologia Cambrensis for January contains "Early Cardiganshire," being the address by Mr J. W. Willis-Bund at the last annual meeting, "the Oldest Parish Registers" (continued), an account of an interesting "Find of British Urns" near Capel Cynon in Cardiganshire, in August last, "the Discovery of an Early Christian Inscribed Stone at Treflys," Carnarvonshire, in September, and "the Roman inscription at Carnarvon," which has long been in the Carnarvon Museum. A large portion of Folk-Lore (vol. 15, iv.) is occupied with a continuation of Mr A. B. Cook's "European Sky-God," of which we said something in our notice of the last part. This is followed by " Notes from Armenia," by J. Rendel Harris, who gives a great deal of curious and interesting information, in the course of which he mentions a custom of placing loaves of bread on a dead body. The loaves,it was said, used to be eaten. Mr Harris leaves it to Messrs Frazer and Hartland to decide whether this was a case of "sin-eating." In Collectanea the Folk-lore of the negroes of Jamaica is continued. Here are some of their beliefs; in several cases they are like those which prevail at home : — A trembling of the lips prognosticates kissing. A rainy wedding day prognosticates an unhappy married life, and vice versd. If a friend offers a pin, pen, knife, or scissors to another their friendship will be broken. An itching of the palm of the hand betokens the reception of money. A man of mediocrity in spiritual matters of life becomes a "rolling calf" after death, for he is too good for hell, and too wicked for heaven. A young lady who sits on a table never gets married. If you turn over your money at new moon it will increase as the moon grows. If ghosts are haunting your house nail a horseshoe over the door. Itching of the nose shows that vou are going to kiss a fool. "Dairy Folk-lore and other Notes from Meath and Tipperary" is also included in Collectanea.

THE SIN EATER.—The question of the alleged Sin Eater in Wales has often been mentioned, and discussed, in Bye-Gones. It may be interesting to give the following, from a paper in Folk-Lore (vol. 15, iv.), "Notes from Armenia." The writer, Mr Rendel Harris, visited Archag, an Armenian village, where he attended service: — At the evening service, to my great surprise, I found that when the congregation dispersed, a corpse laid out for burial was lying in the midst of the building. It had, in fact, been brought in before we came, and was to lie in the church in preparation for burial next day. I noticed that two large flat loaves of bread had been placed upon the body. Inquiry as to the meaning of this elicited no other explanation than that the bread was for the church mice and to keep them from eating the corpse. I did not feel satisfied with the explanation. Some months later, on mentioning the incident to some intelligent Armenians in Constantinople, they frankly admitted that in former days the custom was to eat the bread, dividing it up amongst the friends of the deceased. Whether this is a case of sin-eating I leave Mr. Frazer and Mr. Hartland to decide. W.O.

WELSH FOLK-LORE.

"Folk-Lore and Folk-Stories of Wales," by Marie Trevelyan (London: Elliot Stock, 10s. 6d), is, as Mr. Sidney Hartland says in his introduction, an addition to collections already made, like those of Sir John Rhys and the Rev. Elias Owen. The author is a collector pure and simple; she contents herself with noting down, under various heads, the sayings and stories and superstitions which she has heard, or gathered from manuscripts or other sources, and she had the advantage of inheriting a manuscript collection made by her late father, to which have been added contributions from other members of her family on both sides. Ihe collection is chiefly from South Wales, as the reader will soon see, but the North also is Vol. XI., New Series. [Vol. 20th from the beginning] called upon for contributions. With the north, we should think, the author is not so well acquainted as with the south. ...

...
There are many interesting stories in the section devoted to Corpse Candles and Phantom Funerals. One is from a person who, many years ago, lived at a mining village in the neighbourhood of Ruabon. In the twilight of a December day he saw a funeral procession and heard the people singing, and he was surprised to find that they passed1 the church and reached a house, where they vanished. About six weeks later he saw a real funeral procession passing the church and halting at the same house, and he learnt that the body was that of a person who had died in the south of England, and was brought home for burial next day. Another story is from Corwen: —

The man said: "I was coming home late from a neighbouring village, when I suddenly heard wailing sounds a short distance in advance. I paused and listened, and suddenly found myself borne backward in a funeral procession. I distinctly saw the coffin, and recognized, one or two persons in the crowd beside me. With the procession I was borne on to the ancient parish church of St. Julian, and not far from the doorway saw a well-known Dissenting minister approaching and joining us. Then the whole phantom vamjslhed. I was greatly frightened, and on reaching home promptly related my experiences. About fourteen days later, a friend of ours died in Corwen. I went to the funeral, and, arriving rather late, was pressed backward in the crowd. Near the old church, a well-known Dissenting minister joined the procession, and in it I recognized other people who appeared previously as phantoms."  ...

...

... Of another old custom, "Chaining the bride and bridegroom at a wedding," we read that it is "common at all country weddings to-day." This must refer to South Wales. Do any of our readers know of its survival in the north ? A tempting subject of d:scussdon is "the sin-eater," mentioned on page 276, but we will not enter into it now. It was discussed at some length in Bye-Gones many years ago, and the question whether there ever was such a custom in Wales is a perennial one. We have said enough to show our readers that they can find much to interest them in the book before us.

QUERIES. HALLOW E'EN.

Pennant records that in North Wales "there is a custom upon All Saints' Eve of making a great fire called Coel Coeth, when every family about an hour in the night makes a great bonfire in the most conspicuous place near the house; and when the fire is almost extinguished, everyone throws a white stone into the ashes, having first marked it; then, having said their prayers, turning round the fire, they go to bed. In the morning, as soon as they are up, they come to search out the stones ; and if any one of them is found wanting, they have a notion that the person who threw it in will die before he sees another All Saints' Eve." They also distribute ' soul cakes' on All Souls'-day, at the receiving of which poor people pray to God to bless the next crop of wheat. Mr Owen's account of the bards, in Sir R. Hoare's *Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales*, says, " The autumnal fire is still kindled in North Wales on the eve of the first of November, and is attended by many ceremonies ; such as running through the fire and smoke, each casting a stone into the fire, and all running off at the conclusion to escape from the black short-tailed sow; then supping upon parsnips, nuts, and apples; catching at an apple suspended by a string with the mouth alone, and the same by an apple in a tub of water ; each throwing a nut into the fire, and those that burn bright betoken prosperity to the owners through the following year, but those that burn black and crackle denote misfortune. On the following morning the stones are searched for in the fire, and if any be missing they betide ill to those that threw them in." All the foregoing, and much more, appears in Hone's Every-day Book, and many of the older of my readers will remember some of the All Saints' eve customs as here described, common on the Welsh Border. I should very much like to see, in *Bye-gones*, an account of the manner in which the festival is kept *this* year of grace, 1872, in the Borders of Wales. —Cynog.

HALLOW E'EN (O A., Oct. 30, 1872).

The extract from Hone's *Every Day Book*, containing a quotation from Pennant, must contain a misprint when it calls the autumnal fires in Wales 'Coel Coeth.' 'Coelcerth' or 'Coelcen' must be the word. Coelcerth, as in *Merionthshire*, is a proper term for any large fires, whether of gorse or heather on the hills, or bonfires lit up at rejoicings, and, as is the case every year, on the borders, on Hallow E'en. In Llanarmon district, near Oswestry, they say Coelcen, which is probably a corrupted word. By the way where does Pennant allude to these fires? I never remember such fires lighted in the border town of Oswestry, on All Saints' Eve, or the game of bobbing for apples in a tub of water, or suspended by a string ; although these amusements were common enough at our wakes. But we do, annually, hear children sing at our. doors the following ditty :— 

Wissel wassel, bread and posse!,  
Cwrw da, plas yma :  
Apple or a pear, plum or a cherry,  
Any good thing that will make us merry.

Go down to your cellar,  and draw some beer,  
And we won't come here till next year.

Sol cakes, sol cakes,  
I pray you good missis, a sol cake,  
One for Peter, and two for Paul,  
And three for the man that made us all.

God bless the master of this house,  
Likewise the mistress too,  
And all the little children,  
Around the table too.  
Their pockets lined with silver,  
Their barrels filled with beer,  
Their pantry full of pork pies,  
I wish I had some here.

The roads are very dirty,  
My shoes are very thin,  
I've got a little pocket,  
To put a penny in.  
Up with the kettle, and down with the pan,  
Give us an answer, and we'll be gone.

I did not hear the whole of the verses sung this year, but I think we heard most of them ; and we certainly had the practical application at the end of every version, to wit, a knock at the door, and the request of a 'apenny. —Jarco.

Singular Funeral Customs

SINGULAR FUNERAL CUSTOMS.—

In the parish of Darowen, Montgomeryshire, where my mother was bom. several singular customs prevailed sixty years ago, among them the following:—Funerals in those days were public, and the greater esteem in which the deceased was held, the greater the number of persons who attended the funeral. On these grand occasions the parson and the clerk received large sums of money from the "offerings." My own grandfather's funeral was one of this kind, and I was told by my mother that the clergyman on that occasion received upwards of fourteen pounds in "offerings," and the clerk more. The " offerings," made by friends of the deceased, were only loans, in a way of speaking, as the members of the deceased's family were expected when any such melancholy event happened in the family of any of the persons who attended the funeral to attend and do the same. It was then the custom to regale all who attended the funeral, at the house of the deceased, with spiced ale, and cake, and what was more singular at Darowen, the mourners, as passing through the lich gate into the grave yard, were again served with hot spiced ale, and cake. The money to defray the cost of this second refreshment was not found by the relatives of the deceased, but by the parishioners, and it was a custom for all who attended the funeral, both male and female, if they were parishioners, to send sixpence each to the village inn, the occupant of which provided the spiced ale and cake. There were sometimes as many as four women engaged in dispensing the refreshments. One stood by the lich gate with a large tray, and many pieces of cake upon it; another stood by with a small tray enveloped in a white napkin, upon which one piece of cake was placed from the store off the large tray and handed to one of the mourners as he passed through the lich gate, and the small tray was again replenished. The other two women were engaged with the hot spiced ale, one held the tankard and poured the ale, which was always very hot, into little "tots," and these, like the pieces of cake, were handed one to each mourner, by woman number four. The residue remaining from the fund, if any was left, was spent by a few persons who generally understood these matters, at the village inn after the funeral.

HEL SOLOD.—

I am informed by a native of Corwen (Mr Win. Owen, now of Dinas Mawddwy) that it was the custom at Corwen about thirty-five years ago for women and children to go from house to house on All Saints' Day (November 1) to collect cakes called " Solod." The custom was called " Hel Solod." The cake was generally made of barley-flour, without any addition of more appetising ingredients than salt and water ; and it was about one inch thick, and four inches in diameter. Souling, I am told, still prevails in Shropshire, where contributions are solicited by singing the following doggerel:—

Soul! Soul! for a soul-cake ;  
Pray, good mistress, for a soul-cake.  
One for Peter, and two for Paul,  
Three for them who made us all.

Soul ! Soul ! for an apple or two ;  
If you've got no apples, pears will do.  
Up with your kettle, and down with your pan,  
Give me a good big one, and I'll be gone.

Soul! Soul! for a soul cake, etc.  
An apple or pear, a plum or a cherry,  
Is a very good thing to make us merry.  
—(*The Leisure Hour, 1876, p. 730*).

The lines, I think, will throw some light on the Corwen custom; and I would suggest that " Solod " is a corruption of soul with the Welsh termination- *od*=*Soul-od*. Mr Owen does not know whether the custom still survives at Corwen. But he mentioned that apples, bread and cheese, or any other articles, of diet, were given at those houses where cake had not been prepared, or had been distributed. The supplicatory doggerel at Corwen was much shorter than the English one : — 

Dydd da i chwi heddyw,  
Welwch chwi 'n dda ga' i dipyn bach o fwyd cenedl y meirw ?—Amen. 

" *Cenedl* y meirw " they said ; whatever that may mean. May it not be a corruption of " Dy' gwyl y Meirw ?" I may also mention that it was customary at Dinas Mawddwy forty years ago, if not later, for children to go about on All Saints' Day to collect bread and cheese, which custom they called " Bara 'chawsa." They used to ask for it in the following form :—

Bara 'chawsa, bara 'chawsa,  
Os ca' i beth, mi neidia ;  
Os na cha' i ddim, mi beidia.

But it does not appear that the Dinas Mawddwy boys were so vulgar as to make use of rude remarks, or to mark the doors with chalk, in case of refusal, as I am told their contemporaries at Corwen used to do.

NOTES. ALL HALLOWS' EVE.—

It may be well to place on record the exact words now sung on All Hallows' Eve at Oswestry. They were taken down at my door last All Hallows' Eve. The boys who sang, asked where they learnt the words, seemed to think it a curious question: the words had come to them, probably, among their earliest impressions:—

Wissil wassal, bread and possal,  
Apple or a pear, plum or a cherry,  
Any good thing to make us merry.  
The roads are very dirty,  
My shoes are very thin,  
I've got a little pocket To put a penny in.  
If you haven't got a penny,  
A ha'penny will do,  
If you haven't got a ha'penny,  
God bless you !  
Sol cake ! sol cake !  
One for Peter, two for Paul,  
Three for the man that made us all.  
W.O.
