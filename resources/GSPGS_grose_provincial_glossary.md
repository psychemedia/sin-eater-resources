Corpse Candles 

are very common appear* ances in the counties of Cardigan, Carmar- then, and Pembroke, and alfo in fome other parts of Wales. They are called Candles, from their refemblance, not of the body of the candle, but the fire ; becaufe that fire, fays the honeft Welchman, Mr. Davis, in a letter to Mr. Baxter, doth as much referable material candle-lights, as eggs do eggs; faving that, in their journey, thefe candles are fometimes vi- fible, and fometimes difappear; efpecially if any one comes near to them, or in the way to meet them. On thefe occafions they vanifli^ but prefently appear again behind the ob- ferver, and hold on theit courfe. If a little
candle is feen, of a pale or bluiffi colour, then follows the corpfe, either of an abortive, or fome infant; if a large one, then the corpfe of fome one come to age. If there be feen' two, three, or more, of different fizes — fome big, fome fmall— then (hall fo many corpfes pafs together, and of fuch ages, or degrees. If two candles come from different places, and be feen to meet, the corpfes will do the fame; and if any of thefe candles be feen to turn afide, through fome bye path leading to the church, the following corpfe will be found to take ex- adly the fame way-
Sometimes thefe Candles point out the places where perfons fhall ficken and die. They have alfo appeared on the bellies of pregnant women, previous to their delivery; and predicted the drowning of perfons pafling a ford. All thefe appearances have been feen by a number of perfons ready to give their teflimony of the truth thereoj^ fome within three weeks of Mr. Davis's writing the letter here quoted.
Another kind of fiery apparition peculiar to Wales, is what is called the ^an^^e^ or 7/?»- wed. This appeareth, fays Mr. Davis, to our feeming, in the lower region of the air, ftraight
5nd long, not much unlike a glaive; mours or Ihoots diredlly and level (as who flioiild fay, ril hit), but far more flowly than falling ftars- It lighteneth all the air and ground where it paffeth, lafteth three or four miles, or more, for aught is^known, becaufe no man feeth the rifing or beginning of it; knd, when it falls to the ground, it fparkleth, and lighteth all about. Thefe commonly announce the deceafe of free- holders, by falling on their lands: and you Ihall fcarce bury any. fuch with us, fays Mr. Davis, be he but a lord of a houfe and garden, but you Ihali find fome one at his burial, that hath feen this fire fall on fome part of hiji lands. Sometimes thofe appearances have been feen by the perfons whofe death they foretold; two inftances of which Mr. Davis records, as having happened in his own family.

Corpse Candle


C'oKpst; Canutes are very eoninion appearances in the counties of Cardigan, Caerniarthen, and Pembroke, and also in some other j)arts of Wales. " Tliey are calle<l Candles, from their resem- blance, not of the body of the candle, but the file; because that tire," says the honest Welchman, Mr. Davis, in a letter to Mr. Baxter, " doth as much resemble material candle-lights, as eggs do eggs : saving that in their journey, these can- dles are sometimes visible, and s<)me- tinies disa|>pear; especially if any one coines near to them, or in the way to meet them. On these occasions they vanish, but presently appear again be- hind the observer, and hold on their course. If a little candle is seen, of a pale or bluish colour, then follows the corpse, either of an abortive, or some infant ; if a large one, then the corpse of some one come to age. If there be seen two, three, or more, of different sizes—some big, some small— then shall so many corpses pass together, and of such ages, or degrees. If two candles come from ditferent places, and be seen to meet, the corpses will do the same ; and if any of these caiulles be seen to turn aside, through some bye-path lead- ing to the church, the following corpse ■will be found to take exactly the same way.
" Sometimes these Candles point out tlie places where jjersons shall sicken and die. They have also appeared on the bellies of pregnant women, previous to their delivery ; and pre- dicted the drowning of persons passing a ford. All these appearances have been seen by a ninnber of persons ready to give their testimony of the truth tliereof, some within three week
of Mr. Davis's writing the letter here quoted."
Another kind of iiery apparition pe- culiar to Wales, is what is called the Tun-we, or l\tn-iv(ti. " This appear- eth," says Mr. Davis, " to our seem- ing, in the lower region of the air, straight and long, not much unlike a glaive ; mours or shoots directly and level (as who should say, I'll hit), but far mure slowly than falling stars. It lighteneth all the air and ground where it jiasseth, lasteth three or four miles,, or more, for aught is known, because no man seeth the rising or beginning of it; and, when it falls to the ground, it sparkleth, and lighteth all about.' These commonly announce the decease of freeholders, i>y falliiig on their lands ; " and you shall scarce bury any such ■with us," says Mr. Davis, " be he but a lord of a house and garden, but you shall tiiul some one at his burial, that hath seen this fire fall on some part of his lands." Sometimes those appear- ances have been seen by the persons.- whose death they foretold ; two in- stances of which Mr. Davis records, as having happened in his own fan)ily.
