TIPYN O BOB PETH

The superstition of the Sin Eater, a poor half starved wretch, bribed by a dole of bread, beer, and a sixpence, to attend at a funeral, and by accepting such a tender to take upon him the sins of the defunct, is noticed in the same volume [ "the Year Book"], and referred to certain counties in North and South Wales, where we have reason to believe it still exists."

LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES.- The following letter has appeared in the Academy. "Llanymawddwy Rectory. Merioneth November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy*of November 6th, (p 478) I find an extract from an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales", referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which be takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking*  after death; this functionary it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater". The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact, with funerals but I have never found a trace of such a custom, asd I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquires on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends. D. SILVAN EVANS

Notes: THE SIN EATER.

The Academy of Nov. 20, contains the following letter on the subject, in reply to the Rev. Silvan Evans :—

In reference to the strange profession of a Sin-Eater, mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in Blackwood resides. Croeswylan, Oswestry. ASKEW ROBERTS.

The following is the information given by Hone in his *Year Book*, col. 858:— According to Lawrence Howell, *History of the Pontificate*, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, "They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, however, Sin Eating has been a very much more vulgar affair, and a letter from John Bagford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's *Collectanea*, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:—

Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old "sire," (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

Bagford states that he received his information from "the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounts of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own handwriting. In these he tells of "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a professional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon "at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

BYE-GONES December 22, 1875.

THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)- The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter signed RHEIDIOL, Twmbariwn, on this subject, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer proceeds to say :- I lived at Llandebie many years ago, and I am well acquainted with the history of that parish and its customs and traditions, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a thing. I am well acquainted with Welsh lore in almost every parish in South Wales, which I collected for the late Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little superstitious, but he is far too intelligent to believe in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Association, that they have better foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.

The discussion on this subject, commenced in the Academy, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in Bye-gones towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the writer of an article in Blackwood, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthenshire, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave Dec 1. 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are now informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the existence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1876, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's communication.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES

Further correspondence has appeared in the *Academy* on this question, but no fresh light has been thrown on the alleged custom. On February 26th, Mr E. R. Morris gives from Ruscoe's *South Wales* a quotation from the *Mountain Decameron*, in which "what is believed to have been the last Sin-Eater in Wales," is stated to have lived somewhere between Aberystwyth and Machynnlleth, but Mr Askew Roberts, in the last number, shows, by a further quotation from the book itself, that this was only a fancy sketch, founded on Aubrey's "leane raskal" In another letter, replying to one by the author of the *Blackwood* article, Mr Silvan Evans defies that gentleman to make good his assertion the superstition is "still surviving in North and South Wales."

LITERATURE.

BRITISH GOBLIN  Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends and Traditions; by the Hon. Wirt Sykes, United States Consul for Wales. London, Sampson Low & Co.

THIS is, to us, one of the most attractive books of the season. Not only has Mr. Sykes carefully culled from published sources —such as Peter Roberts's Cambrian Antiquities, Jones's "Apparations,""Cymru Fu," "Cambro Briton," "Bye-gones" "Archaeologia Cambrensis" all that relates to his subject, but he has gone about amongst the people of South Wales for himself, and taken down from the lips of the elders there old stories of bye-gone customs and once prevalent superstitions. May be that the author places too much confidence in some of those narratives; whether he does or not, they add greatly to the interest of his book, and readers can judge for themselves how much to put under the head of "national superstitions," and how much to the credit merely of the foolish fancies of the narrators. We are glad to see that Mr. Sykes has investigated the "Sin Eater" fable. We don't believe an instance of this practice was ever proved to have been observed in Wales, or Shropshire either, and the author, after giving all the "illustrations" he can gather, says:-

"Such is the testimony. I venture no opinion upon it further than may be conveyed in the remark that I cannot find any direct corroboration of it. I have not only seen no reference to it in Welsh writings, but I have never met with any unlettered Welshman who had ever heard of it."

[The review then goes on to cover other matters covered in the work.]

THE ANTIQUITIES OF TREGARON.

At a meeting of the Literary Society, Mr D. Caron Rees read au interesting paper on the "Antiquities of Tregaron," of which the following is a summary...

...

The next place that will attract our attention is the Parish Church [Tregaron?] and Tower. ... While reading the old parish book some time back, I came across an interesting item which is worth mentioning. It was of an Easter Vestry held about two hundred years ago, when it was passed that "the shoes of all dead men buried in the churchyward be given to the grave digger on the day of burial." The old form of "Gwylnos" and "Gwyliad y Corph" has come down to us from the early Catholics, such as lighted candles and keeping vigil over the dead.  There was also an old custom in the town connected with the "sin eater." When there was a corpse in a house the "sin eater" was invited. The relatives of the dead prepared him a meal and when eating the meal on the coffin he was supposed to eat the sins of the dead person, so as to make the deceased's journey upwards lighter. If the old custom was still retained, I am afraid he would have to make a very hearty meal indeed before he should eat all the sins of some of us in Tregaron.
