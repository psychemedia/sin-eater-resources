Preface

[the preface goes on and on and on and on...]

...

There is in fact, and literally, *no Reading Public in Wales*, but the better educated part of the more secluded Welsh peasantry. The gentry of Wales dispute this, but they had better *disprove* it. Let them do so by attaching some importance to so invaluable a resource, one so innocent, so exalting, so vital to good morals as *reading*. Vermin hunting might still be the *grand* resource.

Facts are stubborn things. *Seventeen* Welsh periodicals circulate *well* among the *humbler* classes! *One*, conducted with ability — and with great sacrifice by the spirited patrons of it, to the honour of their country — *one* acknowledged as worthy of support, by high critical authorities *not* Welsh — has at last *ceased to circulate for want of that support* from the *gentry*. Other orders, seventeen — the gentry *not one: verbum sat*. ...

...

[p17] Finally, in extenuation of what will perhaps be deemed presumptuous ambition thus announced, the writer begs it may be remembered, that he is pleading for no novelty in composition, which he conceits himself the inventor of, but merely a bona fide return to that honest, *heartfelt*, *fearless* tone of expression, which distinguished our glorious old dramatists — for a *little* indulgence to those flowers, even in prose, which Jeremy Taylor did not deem unworthy of even divinity, nor Bacon disdain to strew, even copiously, over philosophy's rugged path.

...

Resigning the auctorial pompous periphrasis of the third person I shall entreat, '"beloved reader," your indulgence for much quaintness, perhaps obscurity, certainly much ignorance of the *outer* world at least, which I feel assured that you will discover in these pages. Doubtless, if I be as ignorant of the heart and human character, as I am of the world and the worldly character, my authorship will be a woful failure.

Something, I hope, is to be allowed for the self-delusions of an almost literal hermit. Shut up or wandering among mountains for these many years past, conversing with few but the rudest people, I have not the advantage of literary or other refined society, to freshen my stagnating thoughts, or correct my erroneous ones; to tell me where those thoughts are not duly elicited, or where it were more graceful to suppress them. I am my own adviser and my own critic, my own "pensive public," and hence, perhaps, ought to be less-severely quizzed if I become, as in the previous lines — my "own trumpeter." Nor do mountains alone constitute my solitude, but the misfortune of antedating old age by the loss of friends. The splendid streets of your huge metropolis, with their immense throngs of people, are to some few bosom-aliens among them, more deeply solitary than mountain-avenues, with their multitude of trees and moving flocks. For myself, I can say that the mighty "hum" of those crowds no more disturbs me, who neither share in the chase of their many interests nor swell the cry, than does the constant roar of the cataracts of my home country. Nor do I state this without a latent conceit that possibly such a recluse, addressing such an audience as the "Reading Public" may be regarded as a curious kind of monster. In such solitude, it is natural for the unguided mind (especially if in the old time enthusiastic) both to hope and despond to excess. I have however reached that stage of "life's poor play" when a writer (and still more if he be a parent) has a darker fear than that of the critic "before his eyes" — Death. ...

[p23] EPISTOLARY POEM


To Dr. Edward Hogg, London.

...

[p24] I have also commenced fulfilling thy request (which I am aware was but a further mental recipe in disguise) to keep a sort of travelling Diary for thy amusement; to transmit any traditions of a curious nature I might pick up from hoary chroniclers— any of those strange dramas of real life, and village life, often romantic beyond romance, which the obscurity of village annals eternally secludes from popular notice. You suggested also, that I should write some- thing in the shape of a Tour, and I told you — (mind, I perfectly remember that *Thou* art not more than one man, when I use the plural pronoun, and do not be puffed up therefore) — I told thee that I would do no such thing — I hated Tours (of Wales above all) — I hated Tourists; that they come to mountains as *gentlemen* travellers; "bring with them airs from" the — *hell* I had almost said — of pestilent London, and they attract fashionable travellers, all on the hunt for those pastoral and peaceful charms of landscape, which eternally keep yielding up the ghost — losing the very essence of their attractions at the mere presence of their pursuers, and their frivolous retinue of menial followers — the corruption of whose society is strangely rapid among the simpler Welsh folk. Wherein one may liken such lovers of primitive life to the anatomists of Pope's simile, who,

"Following life in creatures they dissect, 
"Still lose it in the moment they detect."

All this and more I remarked then; but I have come to a sort of compromise between your imposition of a task, and my aversion. What if I try to mingle the Novel with the *spirit* of a Tour, to *print* the *zest* of travelling and petty adventures, in the "breach" of mountains almost meeting, the perils of the green bog, &c.? This mere spirit will amalgamate with such narratives as Welsh domestic history is rich in; nor will you fail to receive some portion of that knowledge of the "natives" which books of travels teach, even from such gossiping and little didactic method; knowledge possibly not the less pleasant for being only incidental.

[p29] Now, as to the travelling part of my Diary, distinct from the story-telling — I can truly assure thee that there is matter in abundance for rational curiosity, left in Wales, and, what is better, strong vestiges of what we may surely characterise as patriarchal life, if life as rudely simple, yet happy, as that recorded of very early times may be so designated. The *secluded* Welsh breeder of sheep and tender of cattle, leads a life of solitary wildness truly curious to the curious in man's nature — one of pastoral peace, if not pastoral vagrancy, that leaves little to the imagination to fill up for that of an ancient man of woolly wealth, or a modern one among the Bedouin Arabs.

When you read of the picture of primitive modes of even Cambrian life being now wholly lost, of MacAdam and the schoolmaster having swept both Ignorance and Pastoral in their primitive character out of Britain, you may, I am very sorry and happy to say, suspend your belief. Tourists — bookmakers I mean — follow the routes of predecessors, and see with their eyes, and nothing beyond; thence I believe it is that so little is known of the domestic lives and characters of the direct descendants of the Britons, our fellow countrymen. ...

[p33] Such then being the kind of entertainment which for ten days I propose to provide for thee, I shall first ask, Art thou willing to take a cup of tea and a tale with us under some "romantic mountain forest-crowned"? To sit at our tent's mouth on some sunshiny sod, betwixt a hanging wood and water, "far from the haunts of men" (yet peradventure busier with man than ever), sung to by the woodlark or cuckoo, or plained to by the owl, possibly? for our odd amateur-gypsy the Doctor, is fond of reading on into the night, by a very bright moon, or his little lamp when the night is sultry and still. If possible I will make you our guest, without endangering you by night air, or bivouac, or dewy greensward, by remitting you the very feeling of the hour, at the hour, by putting forth my writing tools, even by that lamp if day's be "burned out." (My own health has vastly improved under this novel regimen.) Although weeks or months may elapse before you receive these my dispatches, "written on the field" — of flowers, not of blood — still I prefer penning them on the spur of the occasion — (the spur of the scenic and pictorial beauty of landscape) to writing from mere cold recollection when the glow of the moment is gone for ever.

Moreover, be not surprised, if, after my taking leave of thee at night in this my most disorderly Diary, you find me (or us) by the place I date from next morning, to have taken a miraculous night journey, too long for aught but seven-leagued boots or the Chapel of Loretto to perform. Understand, in explanation, that this next day in the journal is *not* our next day, but the first *agreable* next day, as I shall observe the plan of selection both in the romances and our daily travels. We shall have stages dreary as well as pleasant; and our storyteller, the Doctor, will have his intolerable tales as well as his tolerable. These unhappy stages or prosing tales, which I must suffer myself — far be it from me to inflict on thee. Hence my Diary will be any thing rather than one of ten *continuous* days. For example, I date this from the vicinity of the conflux of the Wye and Irvon, a grotesque nook of the latter near the end of its course, full of rocky ledges, making it a grand and rude channel, down which its whitening waters foam, and roar and tumble very nobly — but our travels will begin in North Wales.

EIGHTH DAY. 215

THE "HERMIT-ERRANT" OR "LONE MAN" OF WALES, COMMONLY CALLED "THE HAUNTER."

Quo vadam nescio; 
Invitus morior; 
Valete, posthumi." — Old Epitaph.

There lived formerly a solitary man, whose habits might have suggested the idea of "Old Mortality" to the great Novelist, had not a Scottish prototype existed. To say he *lived* in Wales, would have been contradicting all traditional authorities, which all concur in asserting that he *lived* nowhere. However, the chief and the last scene of his Wanderings was the Principality. The object of his perpetual travel was (though innocent enough) at least a less religious one than that of the Scottish wanderer. This man's was to watch the last acts of the eventful Drama of Life — hunting, throughout the range of his restless excursions, whatever human beings especially struck his fancy, or touched his heart, quite up to the mortal issue of their being's adventure: for what but a perilous adventure is every born man's emergence from the night of unessential Nought? — the grand (but hazardous) privilege to *earth* (as yet nothing sufferings nothing fearing) — of starting up a figured creation with the breath of the Almighty in "its nostrils" to fear much, suffer more, enjoy little ?

Not the last, however — the death-bed scene alone — was the quarry at which the melancholic curious man flew, but whatever results of passions, or virtues, or failings, might follow those predisponent events, often decisive as death, long before the day of natural death.

For example — when "The Lone Man" — for he was known by that epithet within the memory of old people (his real name "has perished from the earth,"`[" Unknown the region of his birth, The land in which he died unknown, His name hath perished from the earth."James Montgomery]`) chanced to read, in some small dingy-typed newspaper of the day, such as newspapers were then, some "moving accident," or strange outbreak of human passion, or guilty enormity, which left life to the actor or sufferer, if conjoined with deep interest of some sort, attaching thence to such person — ^he would note down the minute particulars, the 'when and where,' of the matter, 
the being's locality, his birthplace^ probable future haunt, (if to be guessed,) with all that could assist his future inquiries about such mark of his curiosity. And as his visits were never ended, only intermitted, to every part of his native country, that is, Great Britain, and often extended to the Continent, this secret haunter of men's footsteps, very often did succeed in tracing persons, who little thought of such follower at their heels, in a man who had no earthly concern in their fates, but that of being also a man. Every body has heard such sayings as these, especially in rustic districts, "they (he or she) came from such a country — they are strangers *here* — but they *do say*" Our hero, like jesting Pilate, when he would not stay to be told what was truth — would never stay to hear what, in most cases, he believed to be *not* truth, as in the vulgar more common-place gossip of such localities. But there are stories of a more serious stamp, and involving a deep interest, often thus floating round individuals or families who have emigrated from their earlier haunts; and it was to these that his remarkable memory, aided by his tablets, afforded sometimes a secret but almost sure clue.

This clue he never permitted to peep from his own breast; but with feigned hstless gossiping inquiry, would by means of it become master of the whole secret of many a fugitive's, many a victim's, many a sufferer's destiny, which yet remained (unless when death had rendered its revelation an indifferent matter,) as profoundly secret as they themselves could desire (his own harmless prying excepted) even were their good fame or life itself involved in the secret.

Now the incentive to all this was not wholly idle curiosity; it was the dregs of something nobler — the lingering of an interest that once touched his inmost heart, but now merely dallied with the overshadowed mind, in its useless age and solitude, helping to gild a little the gloom, and render the shade less dismal.

It was that sort of misanthropy which is the reaction of overwrought interest and curiosity about humankind, and the vehement desire to love man, baffled, and thence indignant, grieved, morose, which made the Hermit-Errant this sort of ghostlike spy on the lives of his brother-men.

For himself, he too might have afforded, unawares, a fine subject for any brother Hermit- Errant, to exercise *his* haunting propensity upon. He was, in truth, an enthusiast, not devoid of genius; talented, but without available talent; virtuous, yet without virtuous principle; proceeding in the right way, but without a guide except his native impulses; like a ship sailing on a right tack by a happy but precarious conjunction of wind and tide. Still with a light heart and conscience, a most sanguine frame of mind, and high ambition but aimless, he reached complete manhood without calamity, or, to go on nautically, without encountering shoal or squall, or leak, to arrest his career. His pride made him self-dependent in his opinions. He deemed it a species of rebellion against the Giver of Reason to accept in lieu of that glorious gift any substitute what- ever — it seemed a downward approximation to the nature of the brute. Hence he despised the aspirant for the joys of Heaven, whose innocence sprung from the fears of the pains of Hell alone; and was thus severed at once from a vast body of his fellow-men, in the point of religion. The same spirit ruled him in the matter of morality; he disdained to be moral on compulsion, and little venerating those whose virtuous conduct was mainly attributable to terror of Law, or of the finger of Scorn, or even more awful terrors — made a Judgment- day to himself of every natural day — a sort of vicegerent God of his mind. Liberty — liberty wisely, temperately enjoyed — was his soul's aspiration — liberty to make his choice between Good and Evil — between Virtue and Vice, without one attracting or repelling power, beyond that Virtue's own ineffable beauty — that Evil's own insufferable deformity.

Thus launched on the perilous sea of Life, the next thought was to what high and happy haven to steer — the solitary, proud, and pure spirit being its own pilot.

But as our present concern with this personage is but secondary, in so far as he happened to preserve a story of more interest than his own life, leave we to future incidental notice the whole long interim between this his life's dawn, and its evening. Suffice it to say, that the habit of thinking over his future course, tempted him to solitude till Solitude and thought began to charm for their own sake. Then he traversed many lands, all with aim to *some* time rejoining society. But thus quitting it, a distaste toward it began to steal upon him; or, at least, the calm retired contemplation of life to please beyond its actual stir. His lonely wanderings with a social purpose grew from a habit into a passion, till a purposeless lone and wandering life became of itself an aim. All his lofty aspirations were cheated with some dr^anl of a morrow always coming, that never came.

To be brief— behold, after his high hopes, his fierce ardours, his lofty contemplations — the creature of all these — the Lone Man! A tall, taciturn, almost death-pale, pensive hu- man figure, already withered and bowed, but less by age than habit of bending over the earth in incessant thought, (mostly sad and solemn,) as he walked where total loneliness produced carelessness of outer personal habits, under avenues of trees ankle-deep in yellow leaves, or the far-out solitary sea-sands in the retrocession of the tide. To others he seemed as attached to the charms of lonely nature as ever. Probably he was; but one who should look within him, would perhaps have found the tie of a very different character. The soft, silken, pleasurable attachment to deep quietude and the mountains, which attracts the happy young, and that sterner one, and stronger far, which binds to them the man of wounded mind and baffled ambition, have little affinity. The feeling young grieve, but the feeling aged die, to be torn from the peace of their solitude. Thus our young enthusiast might have been likened to the wild kids or lambs, frisking on the skiey hill-top bank of spring-green sod, a delighted creature of the wild mountain's fresh sunny outside, but not inseparable. There is, however, another animal family grimly attached to that same mountain, the primeval creatures preserved within its entrails, become long ago one with the cold stone, inseparable but by destruction. The sweet turf, the dam's full udder, attaches *those* to their haunt of the high blue; sullen calm, petrified amalgamation, and a drear antiquity, alone, is the bond of these last to *their* sunless *habitat*. Fantastically speaking, one might compare that young hill-top-climber in his buoyancy of proud hopes, to the former of this class of *mountaineers*; the same, when sobered down into our almost ghostly, white-lipped contemplatist, gliding slow at those hills' feet, in the creeping fogs of the day's and year's decline, in the most lone of the Welsh ravines, to the last-mentioned denizens, grown into the very bosom of the rock.

Like some care-worn loiterer, who, seeing boys in all the eagerness of the game of marbles, stops and watches the game too, but from pure listlessness so stops, so watches; then, passing away, still diverts his gloom with the thought of their blithe looks, and with their voices pleasant in his ears still, but no more regarding which won, which lost — even so perhaps our Hermit-Errant dallied only with his own despair, while seemingly so curious in human dealings — the actors — their excitement, his object; the issue of the game of life they played, of little or no interest.

However this might be, it occasionally happened that a person from beyond sea, or from a distant part of the kingdom, newly arrived in some remote new place of abode, would be startled by the dark reading, the soul-scrutiny, the secret cognizance of a great melancholy eye fixed on his features, with something of the solemn yet passionless earnestness, every one has attached to their idea of the gaze of a ghost — a stoney eye without the scorned nothingness of an effigy — a dead eye without the utter apathy of death, but tenfold its ghastly horror. Not that the watcher exhibited any- thing awful, when the almost angry watched man could revert his own spell-bound eye to observe what body that "evil eye" belonged to — anything beyond a lofty stature, in rusty black, travel-stained, resting on a long wand with a spiked end, which he both walked and rode with. It was useful to sound a turf-roofed bog, ere he ventured on it, as well as to help him on very steep hill-sides, where he was often seen aloft, in the sea's vicinity, at sunset, as if, after a farewell to the yet unsunken sun of the valley, he had climbed for one more smile and last look of the great glorified and dilated sun of the sea, in the melancholy distance of red-tinted fog.

It might be that stranger's former state was well known to this mysterious watcher, but he always withdrew his slow eye, (for he was now "a man insensibly subdued to settled quiet," `[ Wordsworth]`) and if any expression was betrayed at all, it was a somewhat severe pity. His hair almost white as driven snow, compared with his face, where time did not write more than fifty, gave a sort of pathetic interest to his aspect, implying that premature snow to have been shed there by the same cause or causes which had diffused those indescribable traces of a death to the world, which marked his whole sleep-walker-like deportment — a death to the world without a birth to the world eternal, for the Hermit-Errant was never known to enter a place of worship, although he had been overheard either praying or worshipping, in mid-day, on some flowered sunny plot of grass, under the mountain's shelter, where he believed himself alone.

He had a trifling fund, which he strove to flatter himself would hold out Life's day till it was ended naturally — or in some swoln brook, or by a spring-tide surprise, like any other human animal of the shepherd, or swineherd, or beggar breed, his brothers in obscurity. Yet he doubted: and hence every guinea pulled forth wrung his heart, under this too well-founded fear, that his life's yarn and that would not correspond, haunted with a horror of a worse kind of imagerial spectre than Death the Skeleton — Death in the loose, and squalid, and filthy, and death-pale flesh! horrid far beyond bone (the pure resurrection bone, in some sense triumphant over the *wormy* Death) I mean Famine. Yet not so much that actual Gorgon, in its cadaverous blue, haunted our haunter, as the prostrate and obscene half-man half-worm form of Poverty, to which it was tied, grovelling on the belly, crying up to those who tread on it, seizing offal as a prize — a meal; familiar with all pollutions, enjoying the dunghill for its warm reek, and the brick-heap for its comforting though mortal fumes! loathed what had been loved! spurned as nuisance what once held elements of attractive greatnesss? and still the *form* Man's !

A very old attorney of Chester dying, left him a house; but he found it nearly mortgaged to its value, *secundum morem* of much Welsh *ostensible* good property in the hands of the nominal owners. However, one part of this poor legacy was almost invaluable — huge heaps, office-full and garrets-full, of all sorts of documents, in MS., in print, on parchment, with newspapers endless, but disorderly; all these preserved as proofs of something, once of vast import to be proved, *now* become so indifferent as to be cast there to rot! And it was this very feeling that gave them value to our *natural* antiquary as I shall call him. For scorning the pedantic minutiae of antiquarianism, he had a deep, a soul-felt interest in its broad principle. How would he have thrown his whole soul into Geology, had he lived to its era! That most sublime of human researches — (the antithesis of baseless phrenology, boast that monstrous imposture who will! — that most petty of thick-*skulled* whims of the day, with, its flagrant *non sequiturs*, its inconsequential theories, its impudent postulates of its very foundation !) — geology — whose *antiquary* deals with ruins of worlds, instead of those of towers and human writings or sculpturing, and which yet its professors must smear over with *tongue*-honey, *enliven* with nonsense, to render the (nauseous) grandeur palatable to this most intellectual of ages !

To return to our "Lone Man"— he enjoyed this humbler species of moral melancholy, buried, through half the night, among these most musty-smelling treasures.

He handled deeds with huge dangling seals of discoloured wax, all subscribed by anxious, eager hands, "whose very dust was gone," to these proofs of claim to homes of brick, or wood, or stone, whose very ruins were gone! He read, "In regno Caroli Primi Regis," "of what?" said he, with his half-cynical, half- benevolent smile, to himself, by his midnight-lamp, — "of a bloodied and secret hole, somewhere within his own ancestral home of Windsor! — of some feet depth of burning lime — that horrid shroud that received him mangled, for the quicker utter annihilation of the royal frontispiece! — of a bleeding heart, a hunted life, hideous death, and an ambiguous memory! Yet, quoth the lying parchment— "Dei Gratia Regis Magnee Brit.!" &c. &c.— There lay, worm-eaten, more lowly touches of the pathos of decay and mutability. To pre- serve proofs of births, or lives, here he found preserved the most homely scrawls^ yet now affecting —

"Our dear little has just cut her first tooth."

"This comes, my dear mother, to let you know I am safe through my travail, praised be God, and as well as can be expected."

Coming down to recent days, he read over the "news" in the provincial papers thus saved, but with huge chasms in the dates.

In one he read,

"Extraordinary Series of criminal Trials in a town of the Continent, Troxi" (misspelt for Troki, Lithuania).

The date of this he found to be recent — - within a very few years of his then present reading.

Searching for some sequel to what he found very exciting to curiosity, he read at but a short distance of date in his own (rather his late uncle's own) town's newspaper — for it had one — the following notice, which seemed to connect the parties implicated in those trials, with a couple not very long landed in Wales, whom he resolved to haunt if possible. But going round the city at dusk to make a few inquiries, he could gain no clue at all to the couple named in what follows. Fresh people were come to the Falcon — the town's people never observed the travellers — so, though it occurred but some three, four, or five years (whichever it might be) before, he remained master of just so much of the secret, and no more, as the following commonplace paragraphs of the Chester Chronicle afforded.

"Chester. — Lately passed through this place two persons believed to be the same whose extraordinary trials at the bar of criminal law, somewhere abroad, caused so much curiosity, and remained involved in so much mystery, at least so far as regarded the real perpetrator of the murders. The lady, (if this be really the unfortunate daughter who has sacrificed so much to love,) looked dreadfully pale, but very beautiful; but that might be from the sea-sickness, she having been very ill in a stormy passage. She has the Jewess-look, but is fair notwithstanding. The young man had a look of deep dejection, for a bridegroom rather strange, but other ways showed much attention.

"They did never quit their inn, (the Falcon) from their coming, which was by post-horses along coast from Conwy, until they did depart, both times under cloud of night; first, after night-fall, and second, before dawn. They are said to be seeking some deep retirement among the mountains of Wales."

This fragment did not fail to arouse all the curiosity of our Hermit Errant. His next step was to procure a sight of what few journals of news the limited press of that day afforded. But he was obliged to rest with his first-found news of second-hand in the country journal. From that he found that a female and a young man had in quick succession been placed at the criminal bar (the latter twice); that a double apostacy in religion, double crime, involving violent suspicion of murder — fearful penance under the Judaic Law, with all the darker madness of love in despair, — all attached to this very young man, when plunged, or plunging into this vortex of tragical passions and catastrophes, out of which (it appeared by the fragment) he had come, not unscathed yet alive, with the partner of his love if not his guilt, to hide their heads in the wildness of woods, and such peace as the peace of mountains may have in store for bosoms such as theirs.

It will be the work of the following pages to give some "passages" of their lives, prior to this (apparent) flight to a distant land, where possibly the "Lone Man" will be found to have at last come up with them — perhaps to witness fresh tragedies still arising out of those they sought to leave behind, with the friends and hopes of native land, inasmuch as such aim is usually frustrated.

But a yet further introduction is needful, (ere entering on their story,) touching a curious superstitious practice not very long obsolete in Wales.

But a yet further introduction is needful, (ere entering on their story,) touching a curious superstitious practice not very long obsolete in Wales.

THE MOUNTAIN-DECAMERON

THE LAST "SIN-EATER" OF WALES.

A SKETCH, INTRODUCTORY TO THE FRAGMENTS OF THE LIFE, &c. OF JULIAN ACOSTA.

So late as the earlier part of the last century that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of "The Sin-Eater" was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, who, (unless we suppose him an unbeliever) being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confessions during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his already laden soul.

Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom, (but I have an idea by Mr. Kyrle, the "Man of Ross,") which describes a "Sin-Eater," who "lived by Ross highway," and is described as a "gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal."

If we consider these persons as probably not less believers than those who employed them, it is not easy to imagine a condition of the mind more terrific, desolate, and desperate, than theirs; thus more and more removed from the hope of mercy with every death, and assurance of perdition doubly sure.

A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last "Sin-Eater of Wales."

"I got lost," says he, "near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was to gain that between Penyboat village and Machyulleth town. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy morass, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits — the whole being a quaking morass. In truth its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse. It forms a great brown-black triangle of land, without a tree, or any vegetation but patches of gorse. Yet the piles of *mawn* (all fetched away by persons on foot) diversified the dismalness with a sort of low walls, and between was gleaming of some water, from the many holes whence it is dug. Till the moon went down, which lit me a space. I could just distinguish these dismal pools and cuts like canals, by its glimmer. I never saw ought so dismal in my own country as this great turbary of hollow ground looked, a huge green-roofed pit, the pitchy mud thus betraying itself every where, as the large moon, looking red as blood in a foul fog stagnating all over it, took leave of it, and its brown grew browner, and that browner black, till the last to be seen was one horrid blackness, where nothing lived, and nothing was heard but the low roar of the sea washing it on two sides, like the hum of some great city. That deepvoiced murmur of the sea so sounding like a thousand voices, made it more shocking to look upon, the space between, as dumb as a great grave. More than once I thought a light glimmered in the very midst, but I took it for the Jack-a-lantern, if not something worse, for I had heard of Wreckers, and there had been a shipwreck, the weather wild, and even the day had been hardly light.

"At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a pleasant cottage taper instead of that will-o'-wisp of the black bog, which was as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, the corpse-candle, carried by a figure of one (as these Welsh say) whose own burial will soon take place, in the spot it vanishes at. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office — that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the Cross, and then praying for a transfer of whatever pains or penances in fire or "thick-ribbed ice," or molten lead, or what beside monastic belief attached to the perdition of tormented souls, from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever."

This is the traveller's account of this incident.

He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road's point, the straw of her husband's late bed — the usual signal of a death in the house.

The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dared by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse. One curious belief was current, that he was no other than "The Wandering Jew" — the man who spit on his Saviour, and cannot die — that fable familiar to so many countries.

Now as this traveller and the wretched being he stood in the dark and wind expecting, will be hereafter returned to, to avoid double description, this sketch may conclude, whose only purpose was to explain the character of a Sin-Eater of Wales, and the habits of one.

The mountain Decameron
by Downes, Joseph

Publication date 1836

p310-12

Assembled all at breakfast we began to talk over superstitions of mountaineers, which seem borrowed from such aerial spectacles.

"The superstitions of Wales," the Doctor remarked, "form no part of the popular *poetry* of our age; yet there exist many grandly imaginative. How few know any thing about our *Cwn Annwn*, `[*Annwn. — The bottomless abyss; Hell, in the ancient sense, as the "bourn" of all spirits.]` that is 'Dogs of the Sky,' but which their office, as assigned, would warrant us to call the *Bloodhounds of Souls*! by earthly analogy. Sudden fires trail along the heavens at the moment of a dying person's body and soul taking leave, and that light is no other than that fire which each of that terrible pack always has following after like a chain; and sounds like the yellings of an earthly hunt may be heard in the dumbness of midnight, and which hunting is no less than the chase of the parting soul by these fiends of the sky, as it flies towards Heaven^s gate before them, the flight for nothing less than *eternal* life or death! What superstition affecting *mortal* life and its brevity, and its briefer pains, can compare in terror, in wildness, or sublimity with this? with these bowlings and huntings for immortal souls, these wildfires trailed by demon bloodhounds, across all the deep-blue *Chase* of the midnight heavens, and the issue of the dread hunting never revealed to the mourner, upgazing from the gate of the house of mourning? The light borne in the hand of a spirit, moving the way a corpse shall soon be borne, and called the *Canwyll Corph* — Corpse Candle — is better known; and a solemn fancy is that !

"More terrible and forcible in mournful conception is the strange being that crosses the twilight path of the Welsh mountaineer, and which warns him by its mere presence, of a death in his house near at hand. The *Cyowraeth* is the likeness of a woman, frightfully cadaverous of visage, bringing all the festering horror of a three weeks' burial in its grim yet not utterly disfeatured loathsomeness, abroad into the world of life, divulging the foulest secrets of the grave! This form stands direct in some lonesome path of the startled person, tossing her long grisly arms in the air and wringing her earthy lengths of wasted hand, and — shaking down her already worm-beset hair over her eye-holes, and their sunken dead-lights fixed upon his, steady as the basilisk's on its prey, but gloomy — sets up such a cry of wild weeping, and utters two words only, so terrible in their power, that they for the moment arrest the moving blood in the veins of the hearer — the Welsh words signifying 'Oh, my wife !' or 'Oh, my husband !' according to the sex of the shortlived object of its fatal forewarning."
