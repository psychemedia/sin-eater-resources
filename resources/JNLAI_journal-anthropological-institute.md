[Discussion on a paper "On the Belief in Bhutas—Devil and Ghost Worship in Western India., pp408- By M. J. Watnovsz, F.R.A.S."]


Mr. Moggridge said : Mention was made of superstitious observances in our own island. I may, therefore, be permitted to bring to your notice a curious custom that not long since was still extant in South Wales and some of the adjoining counties, that of the Sin-eater. More than two centuries ago a well-known writer, Aubrey de Gentilésisme gives a full account of this observance in Herefordshire, where he was fortunate enough to "interview" the Sin-eater himself. Among the mountains of South Wales I find a similar ceremony prevailing down to almost our own times. When a person died, the Sin-eater of the district was called in. On his arrival he received a plate, on which he poured some salt. Upon the salt he placed a piece of bread, laid the plate on the chest of the defunct, muttered words of charmed power while bending over the corse, then eat the bread, whereby he eat up and appropriated to himself all*the sins of the deceased, received two shillings and sixpence for his services, and quickly retired from the pitying gaze of are present, who regarded him as one utterly and irremediably lost.

Mr. Jeremiah said: I was very much interested in the paper just read. With reference to the alleged custom of *sin-eating* in Wales, mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, I would remark that the discussion raised by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans in the (November 5, 1875) appears to have gone adrift for want of the Welsh word for *Sin-eater*. The discussion arose, as all must be aware, from a statement made by a writer in *Blackwood's Magazine* for last month, in an article on the Legend and Folk-lore of North Wales,' where he says, in reference to a funeral custom, that the "Scapegoat . . . is currently called a 'sin-eater.'" Dr. Evans demanded the Welsh equivalent, which the author of that article could not give, in consequence of, he says, "my ignorance of Welsh." (Academy, Nov. 27, p. 555.) Had he referred to Bingley’s "North Wales," vol. ii. p. 278, he would have seen a way out of his difficulty, and a clear answer to the query put by Dr. Evans; and Mr. Moggridge will also see, I think, that the custom was not known as sin-eating, although the original meaning may have been of that nature. Bingley says, "It is usual in several parts of North Wales for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person of the same sex, and nearly the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment, and in some instances for weeding and adorning it on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called Diodlys, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where, at the same time, the body is standing ona bier. It had its name from a custom, which is now discontinued (1804), of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceed with the body to the church." It appears, then, that the custom means simply a "gift of ale or beer," and not *sin-eating*. Pennant’s (in his "Tours in Wales," vol. iii. p. 159, edition 1810) account is slightly different. He says: "Previous to a funeral it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next-of-kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter—for it must be a female—to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves in a t dish, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it *immediately*. When that was done they kneeled down, and the minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceeded with the corpse, and at every crossway between the house and the church they laid down the bier and knelt, and again repeated the Lord's Prayer, and did the same when they first entered the churchyard." This custom, and that of the alleged sin-eating, are conclusively one and the same, viz. that of Diodlys.

Mr Edkins and the President also made a few remarks.
