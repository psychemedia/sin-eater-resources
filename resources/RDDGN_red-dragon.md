A correspondent calls attention to a curious scrap of folk lore occurring in the Rev. Paxton Hood's book on *Christmas Evans, the Preacher of Wild Wales* published a couple of years ago. According to the author "the superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Carmarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular superstition was that when a person died the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person ; he then uttered an incantation over the bread, after which he proceeded to eat it, thereby *eating the sins of the dead person*. This done he received a fee of two-and-sixpence, which we suppose was much more than many a preacher received for a long and painful service. Having received this he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aiding his exit with blows and kicks and other indications of their faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since, and through the ages beyond that time, we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere prevalent."

It would be difficult to say upon what ground the Rev. Paxton Hood founded the generalisation contained in the last sentence, unless it be that he is neither a close nor a profound reasoner. But what there ought to be no difficulty about is the proof or disproof of the existence of the custom referred to in the vale of Cwm-Aman or in any other part of the Principality. It is a singular, and by no means creditable fact, that our acquaintance with things happening at our very doors should be so often the result of the observation of strangers. Contributions having for their subject any scrap of curious old Welsh customs or folk lore will be always welcome to the editor of the National Magazine. Perhaps in this matter of the "Sin-Eater," of which we should like to obtain other and more authentic information than the Rev. Paxton Hood can give, some correspondent, like "Tal-a-hên," may come to our rescue.

Literary and Art Notes

Our March "note" anent the Carmarthenshire superstition of "the Sin Eater" appears to have excited the liveliest curiosity. Letters asking for further information upon the subject have reached us from all quarters, including one from "an American Reader." We have much pleasure in announcing that the Red Dragon for May will contain a paper, by a well-known Welsh antiquarian, explanatory of the extraordinary custom.

THE SIN EATER.

There are two articles of belief connected with Wales and Welshmen that are firmly fixed in the minds of Englishmen all the world over. One of these is, that there is a village in Anglesey called LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwUtyssiliogogogoch, and the other that there used to be a disreputable old party connected with most parishes, whose business it was to swallow the offences of his defunct neighbours ; and who, accordingly, bore the ominous title of The Sin Eater. The latest reference I have seen to the village with the unpronouceable name is in the *South Australian Register* of Jan. 27th, of this year ; and the most recent "authority" for the superstition seems to be the Rev. Paxton Hood, who wrote a memoir of Christmas Evans a couple of years ago. But, first of all, let us see what the earliest known "authority" on the question has to say about it. John Aubrey, who flourished between 1626 and 1700, is the man to whom all later "historians" are indebted for their evidence of the prevalence of the custom. Poor old Aubrey has been dubbed by no less an authority than Giffard "a credulous fool," and, truly, as another writer observes, "his power of discriminating truth from falsehood was by no means remarkable."

As the substance of what Aubrey says. Brand, in his *Popular Antiquities* quotes : "In the county of Hereford was an old oustome at Funeralls to hire Poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskel) I remember lived in a Cottage in Rosse high-waye. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the House, and layd on the Biere, a loafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of beer (which hee was to drinke up), and Sixe-pence in money: in considera'con whereof he tooke upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the olde Lawe." Aubrey goes on to say that though the custom was "rarely used in oure dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government." It was also observed at "Brecon, and heretofore all over Wales." He instances a case at "Glangors, where Mr Gwin, the Minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this antient custome," and further remarks: "A.D. 1686. This custome is used to this daye in North Wales," where milk, he says, was the substitute for beer.

Now this is positively all the evidence we have that such a custom ever prevailed in the Principality ; for although John Bagford (1717) tells (in Leland's Coll. I., lxxvi.) of "an old sire," who was furnished "with a Cricket, on which he sat ; a Groat, which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of Bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught," he does but copy Aubrey, upon whose text modern writers have founded homilies. Hone summarised most of the evidence in his *Year Book*. The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his *Health and Education* refers to the custom as an illustration of the performances of the Orphic priests, to show that in all ages we are very much alike ; and adds, "Alas, poor human nature !" Dr. Downes wrote most graphically of the custom in his *Mountain Decameron* —laying the scene between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth ; and others, "too numerous to mention," have given their versions of the practice, and specified the localities wherein it is observed ; but when these accounts are analysed, we invariably discern the "original sinner" to be the "long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskel" of the Ross highway.

A very interesting discussion on this question took place in the *Academy* during the winter months of 1875-6, in consequence of an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folk-Lore of Wales," in which the writer referred to the horrible custom of sin-eating. This attracted the attention of the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, who wrote as follows : — "The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals ; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality." This at once called forth replies, but no new facts were obtained; all that was written being but a repetition of Aubrey and his followers. As may be supposed, the Blackwood writer was amongst the correspondents, and he called Professor Evans' attention to the fact that at the Ludlow meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, in 1852, "Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill country of Carmarthenshire" and referred him to the *Journal* of the Society for the report. In the meanwhile Mr. Evans spared no pains to collect evidence, and took up "authorities," and gave the result of his enquiries in the Academy of Jan. 29, 1876. First of all he quotes a portion of what Mr. Moggridge was reported to have said ; which was this : — "In Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt." It will be seen from the foregoing that no mention is made of "within five years ;" and on this fact Mr. Evans comments, but the matter was afterwards explained by the *Blackwood* writer in a further quotation from Mr. Moggridge, which, however, he and Mr. Evans read differently.

In passing it will be interesting to note how old customs and legends get mixed up by modern historians ! Not a word is said by Aubrey about salt ; although the use of salt, in some form or other, at funerals, has not been disputed. But to return to Professor Evans's reply. In a private letter he received from Mr. Moggridge, that gentleman told him that he did "not remember anything that gives a date," adding that "the only written account" of the Sin Eater, "from personal knowledge, is that of Aubrey, ' de Gentilisme.'" And as Aubrey did not profess to speak from personal knowledge, Mr. Evans justly considered the matter as doubtful as ever. Llandebie itself was not unrepresented in the discussion. Mr. John Rowlands, the schoolmaster there, wrote to the following effect in the *Western Mail* : — "I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish ; its legends, customs and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of a Sin Eater ; in fact people there never gave cakes at funerals. I knew almost every parish in South Wales. I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillips. If such a custom had prevailed, I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth." The Rev. Rees Evans, vicar of the parish, also wrote at some length, in reply to a letter from Mr. Silvan Evans. In the course of his communication he says : — "One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have appeared here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age." The conclusion the clergyman comes to, after the enquiries he makes amongst his parishioners, is, that "the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority, or proved by any credible evidence."

Mr. Evans's lengthy communication drew forth from the writer in *Blackwood* an equally lengthy reply ; in the course of which he referred to himself as, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales." And he speaks of his frequent travels over the whole of the Principality ; so he felt competent to offer an opinion, although he had failed to "acquire the language." Before this letter appeared, I had joined in the discussion, and hinted that the author of the paper on the "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales" was a resident of the Herefordshire border ; and I now have no hesitation in saying that it was the late Prebendary Davies, of Moor Court, Kington, whose recent death all who are interested in Welsh literature and archaeology have to mourn. His reply to Mr. Evans appeared on February 8th, and he quotes Murray's *Hand-book to South Wales* (edit. 1870), edited by "a medical man of eminence" (as he believes), for the fact that "the superstition of the Sin Eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman, in Caermarthenshire." After which he goes on to say:—"I refer to the ordnance maps, and find Cvvm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary* refers to the same superstition, and if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr. Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practice on their credulity, and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not easily removed from others which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius on I Cor. iv., 13, traces one such in Caesar's account of the Gauls (B. ix., 6). That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious."

In all this the *Blackwood* writer gives no further "authority;" — for the editor of the *Hand-book* could scarcely be accounted one — and Mr. Evans, in reply, observes that "Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessary remnants of the alleged Sin Eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that 'the more odious part of the custom has been removed,' which amounts to begging the whole question." He considers "it is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to 'refresh' his memory respecting 'the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat;'" and concludes by refusing to give credit to any statement on the authority of "so credulous a person as Aubrey, in any case in which superstition plays a part." Here the discussion ended, as far as the principals were concerned. Another discussion was carried on in the "Shreds and Patches" column of the *Shrewsbury Journal* a year or two later ; and on more than one occasion the superstition has been referred to in the "Bye-gones" column of the *Oswestry Advertiser*. Mr. Wirt Sykes goes very fully into the question in his *British Goblins* and comes to the conclusion that "no other writer of Aubrey's time, either English or Welsh, appears to have made any reference to the Sin Eater in Wales; and equal silence prevails throughout the writings of previous centuries." And as to later "authorities," Mr. Sykes failed to discover one who wrote in the Welsh language, "a singular omission if there ever was such a custom, for concerning every other superstitious practice commonly ascribed to Wales, the Welsh have written freely."

And now, when we might reasonably have expected that the Sin Eater had been laid for ever, appears the Rev. Paxton Hood's book — referred to in the March number of the Red Dragon. Mr. Hood is a very pleasant writer, but he is too impulsive for an antiquary. It was only in 1876 that he gave a glowing picture of Llanidloes, "the home of the really great poet, John Dyer," and told us of "Grongar Hill, a delicious spot in that neighbourhood !" Now he sets up an imaginary being in the district of Cwm-Amman ; and only varies the words of Mr. Murray's editor by remarking that the superstition "is said to linger even now," instead of (as Murray has it), "is said to have lingered until very recently," in that happy valley ! Mr. Hood's assertion was copied into *Notes and Queries* in January last, and will, doubtless, be accepted as gospel by a goodly number; but unfortunately for him, his book on Christmas Evans attracted the attention of a brother minister in the same Cwm-Amman Vale, who promptly wrote to the Christian World to repudiate the whole story.

Literary and Art Notes

...

Since the publication of our last number Mr. Askew Roberts writes as follows: — The question has been asked if some of the funeral customs within the memory of those now living do not point to a more pronounced ceremony on the part of our forefathers ? One writer states —but only on hearsay —that last century it was usual, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the Elor, or bier, for the next of kin of the feminine gender "to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a Welsh cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons, after which a cup of drink was presented, also over the coffin, of which a little was to be drunk immediately. When this was done the minister knelt down and said the Lord's Prayer." No one has corroborated this from the definite information of father or grandfather; but they have spoken of a more modified form of, perhaps, the same ceremony, within their own recollection. Less than half a century ago it was usual at every "respectable" funeral to have made up into packets a couple of bits of cake—one of rich plum, and the other plain—wrapped in black-edged paper and sealed with black wax. One of these was presented to each of the invited guests, who took it home unopened. At funerals of less pretensions a "large round biscuit, of the size and form of an ordinary tea-saucer inverted, took the place of the packet of cake. These were 'served' to each of the parties attending the funeral (by one of the most respectable men present) on a tray called the 'Hand-board,' or 'Server.' The ceremony was gone through just before 'Raising the Body.' After this the 'Tankard' of hot-spiced ale was offered to each person present. This was made of pewter, and had a lid: everyone was expected to take a sip." In narrating this in Bye-gones of May 17, 1882, the writer also called attention to a note in the history of the parish of Llanfechain, published in *Mont: Coll:* by the Rev. Maddock Williams in 1872. He became rector in 1851, and found it was usual to allow one of the sacramental vessels (a silver flagon presented to the parish in 1691) to be used in place of the customary tankard— a custom he at once denounced, to the no small chagrin of the parishioners. How far these customs form a lingering remnant of the Sin Eater, your readers must judge for themselves.

Notes and Queries

The Sin Eater. —

In the Red Dragon vol. iii., p. 450, appears a paper by Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P., Oswestry, on "The Sin Eater," in which it is stated that "John Aubrey, who flourished between 1626 and 1700, is the man to whom all later 'historians' are indebted for the prevalence of the custom" [Sin Eating]. Can anyone give me a reference to that part of Aubrey wherein this custom is dealt with ? Brand, in his *Popular Antiquities*, quotes Aubrey, or professes to quote him in substance, but does not (at least not in my copy) give a reference. I possess a first edition of the Miscellanies ("collected by J. Aubrey, Esq.; London, printed for Edward Castle, next Scotland Yard Gate, by Whitehall, 1696"), but I have not been able to find a single word in them relative to the custom in question.
