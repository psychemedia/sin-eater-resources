Local Intelligence

Frederick E. Sawyer calls attention in *Notes and Queries* to the following folk-lore, which occurs in the Rev. Paxton Hood's book on "Christmas Evans, the Preacher of Wild Wales:— "The superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Caermarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular institution of superstition was, that when a person died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person he then uttered an incantation over the bread, after which he proceeded to eat it- thereby eating the sins of the dead person this done, he received a fee of 2s. 6d. — which, we suppose, was much more than many a preacher received for a long and painful service. Having received this, he vanished as quickly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aiding his exist with blows and kicks, and other indications of their faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since, and through the ages beyond that time we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere prevalent.

WELSH NOTES FROM NOTES AND QUERIES.

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE CAMBRIAN."

SIR,— Whatever *galoshes* may mean now, they once meant Gaulish (shoes), and not, as one with an over-press of imagination said, Goliath's (shoes). The Romans readily received into use Gallic shoes, several kinds of Gallic cars, and commemorated the event of receiving a Celtic basket by enshrining its name in their language.

On a tombstone in St. Anne's, Soho. it is recorded that the most noted act of David Williams' life was the formation of "The Literary Fund." He was born near Cardigan, in the year 1738, and died in 1816. He was educated at Carmarthen, and afterwards officiated as a dissenting minister in different parts of England. Whilst at Chelsea, he is said to have given shelter to Benjamin Franklin in a time of political persecution. In 1776 he published his Liturgy, which is a form of worship wholly independent of Revelation; and it is believed that Franklin assisted him in its compilation. Although often pressed for want of funds, he says:— "I had no relish for the expedient of tying myself to a disagreeable woman for the sake of her fortune."

Where and when was this? E. L. Blenkinsopp remembers that he read of an Englishman who went into a church in Wales, where, during the sermon, whenever the devil was named the people spat, as expressing abhorrence. Paxton Hood, in his book on Christmas Evans, gives an account of the Sin-Eater, a superstition which is said "to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Carmarthenshire." The district has (or better, perhaps, had) a Sin-Eater, who, on the death of a person, was sent for, and be, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased. He then uttered an incantation over the plate, and afterwards proceeded to eat the bread, and this done, he was supposed to have eaten the sins of the dead person. After receiving a fee of two-and-sixpence for his services, be hurriedly departed, aided by the cuffs and kicks of those in the house. This curious custom was formerly observed in Yorkshire and elsewhere.

To the English people of former times, the expression "John Harris" would mean "John, the son of Harry," and thus we may render John Harrison" as meaning (if any meaning is meant) "John the son of the son of Harry." "John Parrison" would fare worse-for be would be "John the son (ap) of Harry the son of Harry," thus doubling, as it were, the certainty as to who he is."

Those who feel honoured in possessing the family name of "Devereux," can prove its ancientry by referring to the parish of St. Devereux iit. Hereford- shire, and the Norman appearance of the name must enhance its value to them. But there may be "Norman plaster" as well as plaster of Paris for it appears that Devereux" is only the Norman plaster on the old Welsh name "Dyfrig." Does not this enhance the honour?

OLD-WORLD SUPERSTITIONS.

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE CAMBRIAN."

Sir,- The remarks made by "H," in his letter referring to the sin-eater," spoken of by Paxton Hood in his book on Christmas Evans, clear up a mystery which has puzzled me for years, whenever my mind has reverted to it. It would probably be twenty years ago, I cannot remember the exact date, but no doubt many in Swansea will remember the circumstance, that Mrs. Hopkins, an old Swansea resident, and mother of the late Mr. Thomas Hopkins, at the time a member of the Swansea Town Council, died suddenly at her residence in High-street - her husband kept a small public-house there, the name of which I also forget. I was one of the first to enter the dwelling after the sad event, and my first view of the corpse, was to find the deceased, fully dressed (just as she was carried upstairs from the bar where she died) lying on her back in bed, on her breast being placed a plate, pewter I think it was, and on the plate were sprinkled crumbs of bread and some salt. The deceased could scarcely have been dead a quarter of an hour when I saw this, and I could never understand why the plate and its contents were placed where I saw them. I subsequently sat on the inquest, and intended to make inquiries into what struck me as curious, but fearing to pry unnecessarily into domestic susceptibilities, I refrained from doing so. I now find, from the letter of "H." in last week's Cambrian, what I never knew before, that the circumstance of the plate, salt, and bread had reference to the old Welsh superstition spoken of by Paxton Hood in his book already referred to, and fully explained in the interesting letter to which I now allude. If my memory serves me, I think the Hopkinses were a Cardigan family, but of this I am not quite certain.-Yours, &c.
J. C. MANNING. London.

CANNIBALISM IN WALES

The discussion on cannibalism at the Anthropological Section of the British Association at Ipswich, on Saturday, was taken part in by Mr. E. S. Hartland, of Gloucester, but formerly of Swansea, who made an interesting reference to the old Welsh social life. He said that there were traces of the old custom of eating the dead to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own country. In Wales, there was, within the memory of men still living, "the sin-eater." It was the practice for a relative, usually a woman, to put on the breast of the dead a quantity of bread, cheese, and beer. The "sin-eater" was expected to consume these things, and then to pronounce the everlasting rest of the departed. It was believed that in doing this he absolutely ate and appropriated to himself the sins of the deceased. This practice was said to have existed in the of Swansea as recently as 1851.

At funerals in some parts of Wales there is a curious custom, says the "Sun." A poor person is hired—" a long, lean, ugly, lamentable rascal"—to perform the duties of sin-eater. Bread and beer are passed to the man over the corpse, or laid on it; these he consumes, and by the process he is supposed to take on him all the sins of the deceased and free the person from walking after death. When a sin-eater is not employed, glasses of wine and funeral biscuits are given to each bearer across the coffin. The people believe that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, but that by drinking the wine the soul of the dead is released from the burden of the sin. In some places it is the custom to send to the friends of a family, after a death, a bag of biscuits, with the card of the deceased. These funeral biscuits - oftèn small, round sponge cakes — were known as arvel bread — arvel meaning ale. When arvel bread is passed around at a funeral each guest is expected to put a shilling on the plate.

The alleged existence of the sin-eater in Wales has occasioned an interesting discussion in the Academy, to which Mr. E. Sidney Hartland has just contributed a series of three articles dealing with the positive and negative evidence on the question. Mr. Hartland was at one time clerk to the Swansea School Board, and was in partnership with Messrs. Davies and Isaac, the firm being known as Hartland, Davies and Isaac. Canon Silvan Evans, the eminent Welsh lexicographer, declares he has failed to trace the sin-eater either in Welsh folklore or in Welsh literature. Mr. Sidney Hartland this week, however, quotes interesting extracts from *Cymru Fu*t and *Drych yr Amseroedd* in support of his view that "there is abundant ground for believing in the existence of the custom of sin-eating in Wales;" and in con- cluding his article he thus sums up:— "I have shown it in the Marches down to the year 1893; I have shown it in Brecknockshire in the seventh century I have shown it in Pembrokeshire down to recent years; I have shown it in Powisland in the eighteenth century; I have shown that in Gwynedd, or the western part of North Wales, it had not died out of memory in the year 1820, though probably it was no longer practised.

Where Canon Silvan Evans has failed to find evidence lying upon the surface of Welsh literature — nay, in his very path as a philologist — it is not impossible that careful inquiry may discover further references to the custom. Even as the matter stands, however, it is amply proved." Mr. Hartland believes the custom to be an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity, originating probably in the custom, expressly ascribed by Strabo to the Irish, of the eating of dead parents; but he adds a grain of comfort in the conjecture that, after all, the custom properly belongs rather to the Goidelic than to the Cymric branch of the Celtic race.
