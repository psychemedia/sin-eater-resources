LITERATURE.

The proverb says it "never rains but it pours." If that proverb were ever applicable, this is the moment; when, after a dearth of novelty almost unprecedented in the literary world, there comes influx most overwhelming. We will first notice the periodical publications, and then glance at the numerous volumes, most of which we have as yet been unable to red, but the names and characters of which, as they have been reported to us, will, of themselves, occupy no inconsiderable space. ... Why the publishers treasure all their stores till some given moment, and then send them out in this sort of torrent, we do not exactly understand—surely if these novels had appeared at intervals, the public would have had more time and better opportunity to read them. For ourselves, we repeat our incapacity to swallow so much "fancy bread" in one week— much less have the power of digesting it. We mention the names of the books, and will *seriatim* give accounts of them, when we have reading and breathing time.

[Includes announcement, without comment, of "and The Mountain Decameron, by Mr. Downes, of Builth".]
