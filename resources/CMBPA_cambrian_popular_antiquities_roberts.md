BURIALS.

When human cares terminate, and human attachments are rent asunder, by the departure of the spirit from its mansion of clay, whatever may have been the previous apprehensions of the event, the affections of the survivors will not, on a sudden, yield to the full conviction of the loss sustained; and the lifeless body retains some share of that affectionate regard which, when animated, it possessed. But its stillness is awful, and whilst the separated spirit may, even by suffering imagination to prevail but feebly, be supposed to hover over its newly relinquished habitation, a sacred respect to what remains will be felt as a duty, and the solemnity of the moment will be increased by the image it presents, of that which the beholder must at one time present to others.

On such an occasion the customs of different nations have varied much, according to their religious ideas and local situations, but all agree in testifying respect for the dead; the grief of the surviving friends, and sympathy, or a wish to console, on the part of the neighbourhood. In uncultivated and rugged minds, grief is a burden, which they struggle to throw off in violent exclamations, and by frantic gesture; they look to others for assistance, and, in the intermissions of exhausted efforts find a relief in the attempts equally rude of their friend to divert their attention. Not so the gentler feeling. There grief sinks deep into the heart; and brooding every remembrance of the past, multiplies and cherishes its sorrows. With the more common and the rougher nature, the customary mode is to prevent reflection, and divert the attention; and hence it has been usual in some places, for the friendly neighbours to assemble in the house of mourning, and watch or stay up all the night previous to the funeral with the relations. The intent of this watching has, however, been often abused; and instead of comforting the afflicted, the company have been so desirous of banishing all serious thoughts, as to turn the occasion into one of drinking and amusement; and has, therefore, I presume, been so far dropped as it is in North Wales, and very properly.

"Previous `[Vol III. P. 160. Ed. 8vo.]` to a funeral," says Mr. Pennant,"it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin,  
"be it a widow, mother, sister, or daughter,  
"(for it must be a female), to give, over  
"the coffin, a quantity of white loaves,  
"in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese,  
"with a piece of money stuck in it, to  
"certain poor persons. After that, they  
"presented, in the same manner, a cup  
"of drink, and required the person to  
"drink a little of it immediately. When  
"that was done, they kneeled down; and  
"the minister, if present, said the Lord's  
"prayer; after which, they proceeded  
"with the corpse, and, at every cross-way  
"between the house and the church, they  
"laid down the bier, knelt, and again re-  
"peated the Lord's prayer; and did the  
"same when they first entered the church-  
"yard. It is also customary, in many  
"places, to sing psalms on the way; by  
"which the stillness of rural life is often  
"broken into in a manner finely produc-  
"tive of religious reflections. To this  
"hour the bier is carried by the next of  
"kin, a custom considered as the highest  
"respect that filial piety can pay to the  
"deceased. Among the Welsh it was  
"reckoned fortunate, if it should rain  
"while they were carrying him to church,  
"that his bier might be wet with the  
"dew of heaven."

After that the corpse has been brought into the church, and the lesson has been read, it is the custom, in some parts of North Wales, that a psalm is. sung, and the clergyman being at the altar, while the psalm is singing, those who attend the funeral as friends of the deceased, approach the altar in succession, and lay
on a small bracket (which is provided for the purpose) an offering of money, according to the wealth of the offerer, and the respect for the deceased. This offering has been considered, as originally intended to pay for masses for the soul of the deceased; but, I believe, it was originally an offering for the support of the clergy- man, as the custom is not, that I have been able to learn, known in England; and the clergy of the ancient British church were supported chiefly by voluntary offerings on the public occasions. In other respects, the funeral is conducted generally as in England; but when the service is over, the friends who have attended it do, in many places, kneel down at the grave, and say the Lord's prayer before they depart from it, and for several succeeding Sundays they repair to the grave, and do the same. In many parts, and especially in South Wales, the friends of the deceased take much and laudable pains to deck the grave with flowers. A bordering of slates or stones, is nicely run around it, and the top bound in by stones laid with taste, in a tesselated manner, which has an ornamental effect, whist it remains a monument of a pious affection, gratified in paying its last tribute to a beloved or revered object.
