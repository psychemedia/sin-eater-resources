The legend of Perseus: a study of tradition in story custom and belief:

(In pages prior, discusses cannibalism)

In Europe, where flesh is not consumed ceremonially at 

the funeral feast, other means even more expressive are 
taken to ensure the same object. In the Balkan peninsula 
the rites are very significant. In Albania, cakes of boiled 
wheat and other ingredients are carried in the funeral 
procession, and eaten by the mourners upon the grave as 
soon as it is filled up. All expressions of sorrow are 
repressed as sinful while it is being eaten; and as each 
person takes his share he says : " May he (or she) be 
forgiven ! " [Garnett, ii. Women, 263. ]  In some parts of the peninsula the cakes bear 
the image of the dead. They are broken up and eaten 
upon the tomb immediately after interment, every mourner 
pronouncing the words : " God rest him ! " [Statements of Miss Garnett and the Rev. Dr. Gaster, cited iii. 
Folklore, 154.] At Calymnos, 
among the Greeks, the funeral, as elsewhere, takes place on 
the day of death. Kolyva cakes like those in Albania are 
then made, and are guarded in the house of the departed 
all night, with two lighted candles, by a watcher who must 
not go to sleep. The next day they are carried first to the 
church and then to the tomb, on which they are set to be 
distributed. The eating of K61yva cakes is repeated with 
similar ceremonies on the third, ninth and fortieth days, 
and again at the end of three, six and nine months and of 
one, two and three years, after death.[Mr. W. R. Patonina letter to me dated 17th June 1892. As to 
repetition of the Kólyva cakes, see Rodd, 126 ; Garnett, i. Worn., 99, 
The times of the commemorative repetition vary a little in different 
places. Compare with this the Sicilian custom of eating on the second 
of November (the festival of All Souls) sweetmeats impressed with 
images of skulls, bones, skeletons, souls in Purgatory and the like. 
This is called *eating the dead*. i. Rivista, 239. A similar custom at 
Perugia. Ibid., 322.] It is impossible to 



 

mistake the meaning of these practices : the image of the 
dead upon the cakes, the acts of carrying them in the 
funeral procession and eating them upon the grave, else- 
where the night-watching, and everywhere the cessation of 
mourning and the pious exclamations during eating, all 
admit of but one interpretation. 

The ritual eating of special food is used at funerals in 
many countries. Pulse is not mentioned as an ingredient 
of the Kólyva cakes. It was, however, an important part 
of the funeral feasts of the Romans ; and Mr. F. B. Jevons, 
commenting on Plutarch, has quoted Porphyry's statement, 
that Pythagoras bade his followers " abstain from beans as 
from human flesh," and the reason mentioned by Pliny 
as entertained by some for the prohibition, namely, that 
the souls of the dead are in them. [Plutarch, Rom. Quest., 65 ; Jevons, xci. ; De Gubernatis, ii. Myth. Plantes, 134; Pliny, xviii. 30.] The various taboos 
and other superstitions connected with beans point to the 
correctness of this reason, and tend to show that pulse was 
in some way identified with human flesh. In the French 
provinces of Berry and the Marche, a plate of beans, or of 
dried peas, always figures among the provisions of the 
funeral banquet. [ii. Laisnel de la Salle, 83] In the Marches of Italy the family on 
returning from the burial-ground sit down together to a large 
plate of beans.[ii. Rivista, 65. ] In some parts of Friuli a soup of beans 
is distributed; in other places cakes of barley, or grated 
cheese. Elsewhere a loaf or cake of pan di tremeste, 
composed of rye and vetch, is given, with wine or brandy, 
to all who come to chant the rosary and other prayers over 
the corpse on the evening of death.[Ostermann, 489, 482.] In the neighbour- 

hood of Rimini the feast consists of a broth of chick-pease. [C. Guerrieri, in i. Rivista, 314. A plateful is set aside for the 
dead, and afterwards eaten by one of the family.] 
But the form assumed by the ritual food is usually either 
cakes or fermented hquor, frequently both. Cakes called 
*wastê* are eaten in the Ardennes.[Monseur, 41. My knowledge of the Welsh custom depends on 
he statement of a Radnorshire woman to my brother-in-law, the Rev. 
W. E. T. Morgan, Vicar of Llanigon. It perhaps requires confirma- 
tion.] In Wales it seems that 
a hot plum-cake fresh from the oven used to be handed 
round to the guests, broken in pieces, not cut with a knife. 
In Sardinia, on the seventh or ninth day after death, 
savoury cakes are prepared and sent hot from the oven to 
all the relatives and neighbours, and to all who have joined 
in the weeping for the dead, or accompanied the corpse to 
the tomb. The family then gathers at supper, celebrating 
the virtues of the deceased between the mouthfuls of food 
and their tears.[O. Nemi, in i. Rivisla, 959. ] Dough-nuts, among the Turks, are sent 
to friends and to the poor on the third, seventh, and 
fortieth days after the funeral ; and prayers for the soul are 
requested in return. [Garnett, ii. Women, 496.] Bread carried in the funeral proces- 
sion is distributed to the poor by the Tamil population of 
Ceylon.[Featherman, Tur., 205.] On one of the Banks' Islands, "when a great 
man dies, the people from all the villages around bring 
mashed yams the next morning to the place where the dead 
man lies and eat them there." [Codrington, 272.] Among the Abyssinians 
the poor receive from the banquet pieces of bread and of 
the entrails and liver of the animals which are served up.[Featherman, Aram., 621. In Barbary cooked food is distributed 
among the poor on the evening of the burial. This is called the supper 
of the grave. Ibid., 511.] 

The Tcheremiss of the Kama and the Volga provide small 
pancakes, which they eat as soon as the grave is filled 
up, every one depositing three morsels upon the grave, 
saying : "This is for thee." [Featherman, Tur., 540. To these we may perhaps add the 
Patagonian custom of killing the horses of the deceased and distribut- 
ing their flesh among his relations. Ibid. , Chiapo-Mar-., 495.] 

In several of the cases cited the eating of the dead has 
evidently undergone a natural transformation into eating 
with the dead. But wherever a special food is used it may 
be suspected to represent the flesh of the deceased. In the 
funeral cakes of the Balkan peninsula the identity is mani- 
fest. I shall try to show that it is the same nearer home. 
In various parts of England and Wales a custom of giving 
small sponge-cakes to the guests is yet in force. In York 
shire and elsewhere the last part of the funeral entertain- 
ment before the procession started for the churchyard was 
to hand round glasses of wine and small circular crisp 
sponge-cakes, whereof most of the guests partook. These 
cakes were called " Avril-bread." The word *Avril* is said to 
be derived from *arval*, succession-ale, heir-ale, the name 
of the feasts given by Icelandic heirs on succeeding to 
property.'[Atkinson, 227 ; iii. Arch. Cambr., 4th ser. , 332 ; Gent. Ma^. Lib. 
(Manners and Cust.), 70; ii. Cymru Fu N. and Q., 271, 275. See 
also ii. Antigtm, 188, where "dyer bread" and "biscuit cakes" 
(species of pastry) are said to have been formerly handed round at 
Negro funerals on the island, enveloped in white paper and sealed 
with black wax.] Now, although it might be suspected that the 
avril-bread represented the corpse, we should not be justified 
in holding that it did without more direct evidence. That 
evidence can fortunately be supplied, from a funeral which 
took place near Market Drayton in Shropshire on the 1st 

July 1893, as described by an eye-witness. "The lady," 
writes Miss Gertrude Hope, " who gave me the particulars, 
arrived rather early, and found the bearers enjoying a good 
lunch in the only downstairs room. Shortly afterwards the 
coffin was brought down and placed on two chairs in the 
centre of the room, and the mourners having gathered 
round it," a short service was then and there conducted by 
the Nonconformist minister, as is frequently done, before 
setting out for the grave. " Directly the minister ended, 
the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four 
glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present 
across the coffin, with a biscuit called a ' funeral biscuit.' 
One of the bearers being absent at the moment, the 
fourth glass of wine and biscuit were offered to the eldest 
son of the deceased woman, who, however, refused to take 
it, and was not obliged to do so. The biscuits were ordin- 
ary sponge biscuits, usually called 'sponge fingers' or 
'lady's fingers.' They are, however, also known in the 
shops of Market Drayton as 'funeral biscuits.'" These 
cakes are not exactly of the shape mentioned by Canon 
Atkinson as used in Yorkshire, but that is of no importance, 
because their shape varies with the place. What follows is 
enough to show that the scene described is not a solitary 
one. " The minister, who had lately come from Pembroke- 
shire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see 
that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to 
put an end to it in the Pembrokeshire village where he had 
formerly been." [iv. Folklore, 392.]

Here, it will be observed, the ritual food is handed across 
the coffin. Pennant, writing early in the fourth quarter of 
the eighteenth century, says that in Wales "previous to a 

funeral, it. was customary, when the corpse was brought out 
of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be 
it widow, mother, sister or daughter (for it must be a 
female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, 
in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of 
money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that, 
they present, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and 
require the persons to drink a little of it immediately." 
The Lord's Prayer was then repeated by the minister, if 
present ; and the procession started.[iii. Pennant, 150.] We can have little 
doubt that this was the same custom. A hundred years 
earlier still it was witnessed by John Aubrey at Beaumaris. 
He mentions it as occurring when the corpse is brought 
out of doors. The food consisted of cake and cheese, with 
" a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno 
Dni ingraved on it, & ye parties name deceased." And 
Dr. Kennett, who annotated his manuscript, refers to a 
practice at Amersden, in Oxfordshire, of bringing to the 
minister in the church-porch after the interment a cake and 
a flagon of ale.[ Aubrey, Remaines, 23, 24. ] In Wales and the Welsh border the 
custom underwent a curious development. It became, for 
some cause, a profession to eat this funeral meal, and 
thereby, as was believed, to become responsible for the sins 
of the deceased. Aubrey describes one of these Sin-eaters, 
as they were called. " One of them I remember lived in a 
Cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the 
Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere, 
a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne- 
eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple 
(Gossips bowle) full of beer, wch he was to drinke up, and 

sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon 
him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed 
him (or her) from walking after they were dead."[Aubrey, Remaines, 35. Ellis reprints from Leland's Collectanea a 
letter from a Mr. Bagford, dated 1st Feb. 1714-15, giving a slightly 
varied account, also professedly derived from Aubrey, of the rite as 
practised in Shropshire. The fee is stated as a groat. ii. Brand, 155. ] The 
profession of Sin-eater and the full ceremony, pagan enough 
in all conscience, have vanished from the earth only within 
the lifetime of persons yet living. The most modern ac- 
count of it was given by Mr. Matthew Moggridge of Swan- 
sea to the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Ludlow 
in the year 1852. He said that " when a person died, the 
friends sent for the Sin-eater of the district, who on his 
arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, 
and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an 
incantation over the bread, which he finally ate, thereby 
eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he 
received his fee of 2s. 6d." (a modest fee for the service, 
all things considered, though it had risen since Aubrey's 
day), " and vanished as quickly as possible from the general 
gaze ; for as it was believed that he really appropriated to 
his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he 
performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in 
the neighbourhood — regarded as a mere Pariah — as one 
irredeemably lost." Mr. Moggridge specified the neigh- 
bourhood of Llandebie, about twelve or thirteen miles from 
Swansea, as a place where the custom had survived to 
within a recent period. [iii. Arch. Cambr., N.S., 330. Traces of a similar custom are 
found in Derbyshire. There no wine is drunk at a funeral until after 
the party has returned from the church. Wine is then offered first 
to the bearers. This order is strictly observed; and it is believed that every drop that you drink is a sin which the deceased has 
committed. You thereby take away the dead man's sins and bear 
them yourself." Addy, 123, 124,  ]

Thus in our own country we find the relics of a ritual 
feast, where food is placed upon the cofiin, or rather upon 
the body itself, or handed across it, and so in a manner 
identified with it, and where it is expressly believed that by 
the act of eating some properties of the dead are taken 
over by the eater. Let us now turn back for a moment to 
the East. At a Hindu funeral in Sindh the relations, in 
the course of the march to the place of burning, throw 
dry dates into the air over the corpse. These, we are told, 
are considered as a kind of alms, and are left to the poor. 
On returning to the house, after the cremation, the first 
thing done is to offer the couch, bedding, and some clothes 
of the deceased to a Karnigor who is in attendance. A 
Karnigor is a low caste-man, — according to some, the off- 
spring of a Brahman father and a Sudra mother. North of 
Hydrabad his appearance and conduct resemble those of 
the servile, south of that city those of the priestly, order. 
The condition of the gift is, that the Karnigor must eat a 
certain sweetmeat prepared for the occasion. If he refuse, 
the ghost of the dead man would haunt the place. This 
means that the funerjil rites would have been incomplete. 
The Karnigor has, therefore, the game in his own hands ; 
and, rejecting the first advance, he demands not only all 
the articles of dress left by the departed, but fees into 
the bargain. "When his avarice is satiated, he eats four 
or five mouthfuls of the sweetmeat, seldom more, for fear 
of the spirit. After this, he carries off his plunder, taking 
care not to look behind him, as the Pinniyaworo [head 
mourner] and the person who prepared the confectionery 

wait until he is fifteen or twenty paces off, break up all the 
earthen cooking pots that have been used, and throw three 
of the broken pieces at him, in token of abhorrence." [Burton, Sindh, 350, 354. ] Can 
we fail to be reminded of the Sin-eater ? Nor is this the 
most remarkable parallel to be found in India. The burn- 
ing of the corpse of a king of Tanjore who died in 1801, 
and of two of his widows chosen for the purpose by the 
Brahmans, is described by the abbd Dubois. He states that 
a part of the bones which escaped the fury of the flames 
was reduced to powder, and this powder, having been 
mixed with boiled rice, was eaten by twelve Brahmans. The 
reason for the proceeding is put by the abbd almost in the 
very words I quoted in the last paragraph. The act " had 
for its object the expiation of the sins of the defunct 
persons : sins which, according to common opinion, are 
transmitted into the bodies of those whom the allurement 
of gain has induced to surmount the repugnance that a 
food so detestable should inspire. Moreover, people are 
persuaded that the money which is the price of this base 
condescension is never of any profit to them." [iii. Mélusine, 409, quoting M. Dubois' work as cited in the 
Annales de la Propagation de la Foi for 1830. Mr. Frazer cites this 
case (ii. Golden Bough, 155) and some others from India, all of which 
I believe are referable to the same origin, though he interprets them 
by reference to the idea expressed in the Mosaic Scapegoat. His 
attention probably had not been drawn to the parallel cases I cite 
above and below. ] If any 
doubt could remain as to the meaning of the Welsh custom, 
this would be enough to dissipate it. But in truth it is not 
needed ; for we have in Europe other usages that set the 
meaning in the clearest light. In the Highlands of Bavaria, 
when the corpse is placed upon the bier, the room is care- 

fully washed out and cleaned. Formerly it was the custom 
for the housewife then to prepare the *Leichen-nudeln*, or 
Corpse-cakes. Having kneaded the dough, she placed it to 
rise on the dead body, as it lay there enswathed in a linen 
shroud. When the dough had risen, the cakes were baked 
for the expected guests. To the cakes so prepared, the 
belief attached that they contained the virtues and advan- 
tages of the departed, and that thus the living strength of 
the deceased passed over, by means of the corpse-cakes, 
into the kinsmen who' consumed them, and so was retained 
within the kindred.[Dr. M. Hoefler, inii. Am Urqutll, loi. In an article on the Sin- 
eater in iii. Folklore, ijo, I quoted Wilkie's description of the Low- 
land Scottish rite called Dishaloof, and expressed the opinion that it 
belonged to the same order of thought as the rites now under discus- 
sion. Though I adhere to that opinion, I have not met with any 
thing which illustrates the mysterious details of the rite ; and I have, 
therefore, thought it well to avoid burdening these pages with par- 
ticulars that I cannot correlate. Mrs. Gomme has exhaustively 
analysed a children's game called Green Grass, apparently connected 
with the Lowland rite ; but the results attained do not help here . 
i. Traditional Games, 153. See Henderson, 53.] Here we find ourselves at an earlier 
stage in the disintegration of tradition than in the Welsh 
practice. The identification of the food with the dead 
man is not merely symbolic. The dough in rising is 
believed actually to absorb his qualities, which are trans- 
mitted to those of his kin who partake of the cakes; and 
— consistently with the requirement that the relatives eat the 
cakes — the qualities transferred are held to be not evil but 
good ones : the living strength, the virtues and so on of the 
dead are retained within the kin. Not less striking than 
the resemblance just pointed out between the objects of the 
Hindu and the Welsh rites, is that between the objects of 

the Bavarian custom and that of the Taridnas and other 
tribes of the Uaupes for consuming the pounded remains 
of their kinsmen in their caxiri. In both cases, indeed, 
there is more than resemblance. The objects are absolutely 
the same ; and it is inconceivable that the European usages 
wherewith we are deahng had any other origin than a 
cannibal feast, the material of which was the very body 
of the deceased kinsman.
