Our last example of these abnormal usages shall be taken from the superstition of the Sin-eater, which certainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may be doubtful whether it extended to the neighbouring parts of Wales. "In the County of Hereford," said Aubrey, "it was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people who were to take upon them the sins of the person deceased. The manner was that, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sin-eater over the corpse, as also a Mazard-bowl of maple-wood full of beer which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him *ipso facto* all the sins of the defunct and freed him or her from walking after they were dead." [Aubrey, in the "Remains of Gentilisme," published by the Folk-lore Society; Sikes, British Goblins, 325; Hone, Year-book, 858. "I remember," says Aubrey, "one of these Sin-eaters, he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal, and lived in a cottage on Ross highway. This ceremony, though rarely used in our days, yet by some people was observed in the strictest days of the Presbyterian government."] Mr. Wirt Sikes in his work upon Welsh Folklore, cited an apposite passage from Schuyler's Travels in Turkestan: "One poor old man seemed constantly engaged in prayer. On calling attention to him, I was told that he was an '*iskatchi*' a person who gets his living by taking on himself the sins of the dead, and thenceforth devoting himself to prayer for their souls : he corresponds to the Sin-eater of the Welsh border." [Sikes, British Goblins. Schuyler, Turkestan, ii. 28.]


Also reference to *Elian's Well in Denbighshire is described as "the head of the Cursing- wells." ... It is said that "cursing-stones" were known in Devonshire and in parts of Ireland.* Sikes, British Goblins, 355 (?)
