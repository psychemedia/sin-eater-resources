Our last example of these abnormal usages shall be 
taken from the superstition of the Sin-eater, which 
certainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may be 
doubtful whether it extended to the neighbouring parts of 
Wales. " In the County of Hereford," said Aubrey, " it 
was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people who 
were to take upon them the sins of the person deceased. 
The manner was that, when the corpse was brought out 
of the house and laid upon the bier, a loaf of bread was 
brought out and delivered to the Sin-eater over the corpse,, 
as also a Mazard-bowl of maple-wood full of beer which 
he was to drink up, and sixpence in money, in considera- 
tion whereof he took upon him ipso facto all the sins of 
the defunct and freed him or her from walking after they 
were dead."^ Mr. Wirt Sikes in his work upon Welsh 

^ St. Elian's Well in Denbighshire is described as " the head of the 
Cursing- wells." A full description of the ceremonies will be found in 
Mr. Wirt Sikes' Collection, British Goblins, T,i^^. Among the authorities 
cited are Cambrian Pop. Antiq. 247, and Archaeol. Cambr. ist Ser. i. 46. 
Compare Souvestre's account of the Chapel of Notre Dame de la Haine at 
Treguier in Brittany. " Une chapelle dediee a Notre-Dame de la Haine 
existe toujours pres de Treguier, et le peuple na pas cesse de croire a la 
puissance des prieres qui y sont faites. Parfois encore, vers le soir, on voit 
des omlres honteuses se glisser furdvement vers ce triste edifice place au haut 
d'un coteau sans verdure. Ce sont des jeunes pupilles lasses de la surveillance 
de leurs tuteurs, des veillards jaloux de la prosperite d'un voisin, des Jemmes 
trop rudement froissees par le despotisme d'un viari, qui viennent la prier pour 
la mort de Voljet de leur haine. Trois 'Ave,' devotement repetes, amenent 
irrevocablement cette mort dans Fannee." Derniers Bretons, i. 93. It is said 
that "cursing-stones " were known in Devonshire and in parts of Ireland.

Society; Sikes, British Goblins, 325; Hone, Year-book, 858. "I remem-

Folklore, cited an apposite passage from Schuyler's 
Travels in Turkestan: "One poor old man seemed con- 
stantly engaged in prayer. On calling attention to him, 
I was told that he was an ' iskatchi^ a person who gets his 
living by taking on himself the sins of the dead, and thence- 
forth devoting himself to prayer for their souls : he 
corresponds to the Sin-eater of the Welsh border."^ 

lamentable poor rascal, and lived in a cottage on Ross highway. This 
ceremony, though rarely used in our days, yet by some people was observed 
in the strictest days of the Presbyterian government."
