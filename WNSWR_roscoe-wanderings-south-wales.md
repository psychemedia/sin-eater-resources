We are apt to marvel at accounts of odd ceremonies and customs in other lands, without knowing half the peculiar habits and ancient rites still practised within the boundaries of our own country ; many of which, especially among the Welsh, may be traced to the highest antiquity.
The familiar superstitions of Wales are becoming gradually fainter and fainter ; but it is notorious that in this county they were more rife than in almost any other in Wales, and that not only amongst the uneducated portion of its inhabitants, but including those who, from their rank in society, might have been considered superior to the delusions of their age. John Lewis, Esq., a magistrate, residing near Aberystwith, writing, in the year 1656, to a clergyman, relates several stories of apparitions, and the *Canwyll Corph*, or corpse candles, with a minuteness and simplicity which show his entire belief in his narratives. The Rev. John Davis, a minister, in Cardiganshire, has written down the order which seems to regulate this superstition : — "We call them" saith he, "corpse candles, not that we see anything besides the light, but yet it resembles a material candlelight, as much as eggs do eggs, only they sometimes appear and instantly disappear : for, if one comes near them, or on the way against them, unto him they vanish ; but presently appear behind him, and hold on their course. If it be a little candle, pale and bluish, then follows the corpse of an abortive, or some infant. If a big one, then the corpse of some one come to age. If two, three, or more, great and little, be seen together, then so many and such corpse will follow together. If two candles come from divers places, and be seen to meet, the corpse will do the like. If any of these candles seem to turn out of the way or path that leads to the church, the following corpse will be found to turn in some place, for the avoiding some dirty lane, plash, &c."

The author of the *Mountain Decameron* gives some graphic descriptions of several other popular superstitions, which I shall transcribe. "The superstitions of Wales form no part of the popular *peotry* of our age; yet there exist many grandly imaginative. How few know anything about our *Cwn Annwn,* [*Annwm*— the *bottomless abyss ; Hell*, in the ancient sense, as the "bourn" of all spirits.] that is, 'Dogs of the sky,' but which their office, as assigned, would warrant us to call the *Bloodhounds of Souls!* by earthly analogy. Sudden fires trail along the heavens at the moment of a dying person's body and soul taking leave, and that light is no other than that fire which each of that terrible pack always has following after like a chain ; and sounds, like the yellings of an earthly hunt, may be heard in the dumbness of midnight, and which hunting is no less than the chase of the parting soul by these fiends of the sky, as it flies towards heaven's gate before them, — the flight for nothing less than *eternal* life or death! What superstition affecting *mortal* life and its brevity, and its briefer pains, can compare in terror, in wildness, or sublimity with this ? With these howlings and huntings for immortal souls, these wildfires trailed by demon bloodhounds, across all the deep-blue *chase* of the midnight heavens, and the issue of this dread hunting never revealed to the mourner, upgazing from the gate of the house of mourning ?

"More terrible and forcible in mournful conception is the strange being that crosses the twilight path of the Welsh mountaineer, and which warns him by its mere presence, of a death in his house near at hand. The *Cyoewraeth* is the likeness of a woman, frightfully cadaverous of visage, bringing all the festering horror of a three weeks' burial, in its grim yet not utterly disfeatured loathsomeness, abroad into the world of life, divulging the foulest secrets of the grave ! This *form* stands direct in some lonesome path of the startled person, tossing her long grisly arms in the air, and wringing her earthy lengths of wasted hand, and, shaking down her already worm-beset hair over her eye-holes, and their sunken dead-lights fixed upon his, steady as the basilisk's on its prey, but gloomy, — sets up such a cry of wild weeping, and utters two words only, so terrible in their power, that they for the moment arrest the moving blood in the veins of the hearer — the Welsh words signifying 'Oh, my wife !' or, 'Oh, my husband !' according to the sex of the short-lived object of its fatal forewarning.

"So late as the earlier part of the last century, that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of 'The Sin-Eater,' was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, who (unless we suppose him an unbeliever), being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did, for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confession during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his already laden soul.

"Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter which speaks of a 'Sin-Eater,' who 'lived by Ross highway,' and is described as a 'gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal.'

"A gentleman, who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last 'Sin-Eater of Wales'.

"'I got lost,' says he, 'near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy bog, for no horse ever ventured among the peat-pits — the whole being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse.

"'At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a distance. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office; that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever.'

"This is the traveller's account of this incident. He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road's point the straw of her husband's late bed — the usual signal of a death in the house.

"'The Sin-Eater,' he was told, 'lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dare by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse.'"
