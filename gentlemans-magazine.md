The following are matters which the author ascribes 
to the middle ages, at least he can assign no earlier date.

The first is the singular custom, now 
obsolete, of Sin-eating.

It appears, that so late as the seventeenth century, there was in the villages, adjoining to Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed. Mr. Ellis, the editor of the Popular Antiquities, has extracted the following curious passage from the 
Lansdown Manuscripts, concerning a Sin-eater, who "lived in a cottage, 
on Rosse highway."

"In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire people, who were to take upon them sinnes of the deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse higwway. The manner was, that when the corps was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the corps, as also a mazar bow! of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up], and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sinnes of 

defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old laws, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22, â€œAnd Aaron shall lay his hands on the head of the live goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them the head of the goate, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all  their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he let the goate goe into the wilderness."

"This custome (though rarely used in our days), yet by some people was observed, even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the parish) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her will; and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this county; as 
also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales.[*Popular Antiq. ii. 156]"
