Why the publishers treasure all their stores till some given moment, and then send them out in this sort of torrent, do not exactly understand—surely if these novels hod appeared at intervals, the public would have had more time and better opportunity to read them. For ourselves, we repeat our incapacity to swallow so much fancy bread’ 1 in one week—much less have the power of digesting it. We mention the names the books, and will seriatim give accounts of them, when we have reading and breathing time.
