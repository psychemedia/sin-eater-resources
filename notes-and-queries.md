MAZER WOOD : GUTTA PERCHA. 

In the Musaeum Trade.icantimium, or a Collectian 
of liarities preserved at South Lambeth, near Lon- 
don, by John Tradescant, 1656, I find, amongst 
"other variety of rarities," "the plyable IMazer 
wood, which, being warmed in water, will work to 
any form;" and a little farther on, in the list of 
"utensils and household stufFe," I also find "Mazer 
dishes." In my opinion, it is more than a coin- 
cidence that Doctor Montgomery, who, in 1843, 
received the gold medal of the Society of Arts 
for bringing giitta percha and its useful properties 
under tiie notice of that bodv, describes it in 
almost the same words that Tradescant uses when 
speaking of the jiliable jNlazer wood: the Doctor 
say.s, "it coidd be moulded into any form by 
merely dipping it into boiling water." It is 
worthy of remark that Tradescant, who was the 
first botanist of his day, seems to have been un- 
certain of the true nature of the " Mazer wood," 
&)T he does not class it with his " gums, rootes, 
woods ;" but, as before observed, in a hetero- 
geneous collection which he styles " other variety 
ef rarities." Tresuming, as I do, that this Mazer 
wood was what we now term gutta ]K'rcha, the 
(lueslion may be j)ropounded, how could Trades- 
cant have procured it from its remote locale? 
'J'he answer is easy. In another part of the 
Musaum Tradescaiitianum may be found a list of 
the "benefactors" to the collection; and amongst 



their names occurs that of William Curteen, Esq. 
Now this "\\'iniam Curteen and his father Sir 
William, of Flemish descent, were the most ex- 
tensive British merchants of the time, and had 
not only ships trading to, but also possessed forts 
and factories on, some of the islands of the 
Eastern Archipelago, the native habitat of tlie 
sapotaceous tree that yields the gutta percha. 
Curteen was a collector of curiosities himself, and 
no doubt his captains and agents were instructed 
to procure such : in short, a specimen of gutta 
percha was just as likely to attract the attention 
of an intelligent Englishman at Amboyna in the 
fifteenth century, as it did at Singapore in the 
nireteenth. 

If there are still any remains of Tradescant's 
collection in the Ashraolcan Museum at Oxford, 
the question, whether the Mazer wood was gutta 
percha or not, might be soon set at rest ; but it is 
highly probable that the men who ordered the 
relics of the Dodo to be thrown out, showed but 
little ceremony to the Mazer wood or dishes. 

A curious instance of a word, not very dissimilar 
to Mazer, may be found in Eric Red's Saga, part 
of the Flat'o Annals, supposed to be written in the 
tenth century, and one of the authorities for the 
pre-Columbian discovery of America by the Ice- 
landers. Karlsefne, one of the heroes of the Saga, 
while his ship was detained by a contrary wind in 
a JTorwegian port, was accosted by a German, who 
wished to purchase his, Karlsefne's, broom. 

" ' I will not sell it,' said Karlsefne. ' I will give 
you half a mark in gold for it,' said the German man. 
Karlsefne thought this a good offer, and thereupon 
concluded the bargain. Tile German man went away 
with the broom. Karlsefne did not know what wood 
it was ; but it was Masur, which had come from Wine- 
land!" 

Perhaps some reader may give an instance of 
Mazer wood being mentioned by other writers ; or 
inform me if the word Mazer, in itself, had any 
peculiar signification. W. Pinkerton.

It is used to signify a cup. Vide Walter Scott's 
Lord of the Isles, where Robert Bruce is speaking: 

" Bring here, he said, the Mazers four, 
My noble fathers loved of yore.' 

And it is probably derived from the Irish " Maed-

quadrangular form, witli a handle on e.ach of the

which was done from tlie angles. A silver " Maed-

leaving Ireland, who puzzled many of his English 
friends by placing it before them filled with claret.

Mazer Wood (Vol. iii., pp. 2.39. 288 ). — 
Your Querist asks, " Has the word Mazer any 
signification in itself?" It signifies iJ/ayj/e, being 
a corruption of the "Welsh word Masarn — the 
maple-tree. Probably, therefore, the use of the 
wood of the maple tor bowls and drinking-cups 
prevailed in this country many centuries before 
the times of Spenser and Chaucer, in whose works 
they are mentioned. In Devonshire the black 
cherry-tree, which grows to a large size in that 
county, is called the mazer-tree. From this cir- 
cumstance I conjecture that this wood has been 
used there in former times for bowls and drinking- 
cups as a substitute for maple. That the original 
word, mazer, should have been retained, is not to 
be wondered at. It is known that when the mazer 
bowl was made of silver, the old name was re- 
tained. The name of the maple-tree, in the Irish 
language, is crann-mhalpais ; therefore the name 
of the Irish wooden driuking-cup mtedher cannot 
be derived from it. S. S. S.

Mazer Wood and Sin-eaters (Vol. iii., pp. 239. 
288.).—The following extract from Hone’s Year 
Book, p.858., will add to the explanation fur- 
nished by S.S.S., and will also give an instance 
of the singular practices which prevailed among 

“ Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British 
Museum are statements in Aubrey’s own handwriting 
to this purport. In the county of Hereford was an 


old custom at funerals, to hire poor people, who were 

to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One 
of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable, poor 
rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse high- 
way. The manner was, that when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf 
of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin 
eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, 
full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence 
in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, 
ipso facto, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or 
her from walking after they were dead.” 

Perhaps some of your readers may be able to 
throw some light on this curious practice of sin- 
eating, or on the existence of regular sin-eaters.

Sin-eater. — Can any of your readers explain 
the origin of “ the sin-eater,” and give instances of 
that horrid practice still subsisting in parts of 
England or Wales, as I am assured it does? It 
consists in the supposed transfer of the sins of a 
person recently dead to a man of reprobate cha- 
racter, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest 
of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have 
released the dead man from the responsibility of 
his sins, and to have taken it on himself; he then 
receives half-a-crown for his services, and is driven 
or pursued from the house with execration.

This practice was the subject of an interesting 
paper by Mr. Muggridge of Swansea, at the last 
annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological 
Association ; but its origin was not satisfactorily 
traced. The scapegoat, and the sacrifice of 
criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been 
suggested. Jelinger C. Symons.

[The custom is generally supposed to have been 
taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi. 21, 22. See 
a curious passage from the Lansdown MSS. concern- 
ing a sin-eater who lived in a cottage on the Rosse 
highway in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand’s Anti- 
quities, vol. ii. p. 247., edit. 1849.]

of his body of a dead man, and offered to another in his

Smoking in Church .—The following is a cutting

“Mr, Elton B, Ede writes to us from Edenhurst,

practice—viz., smoking in church, which I remember 
J mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. 

The Communion-table stood in the aisle, and the farmers 
were in the habit of putting their hate upon it, and 
when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, 
but without any idea of irreverence, have not seen 
this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not 
desirable that it should be revived, it seems a pity that 
it should be forgotten. ’” 

I remember reading somewhere that it was a 
custom among ladies in South America to have 
chocolate brought to them as soon as the sermon 
commenced—a practice denounced by the bishop, 
who —_ against it. He, however, had his 
cup of chocolate in the sacristy after the service. 
His persistence in denouncing it was followed by 
his being found dead in the sacristy after having 
drunk his cup of chocolate.

SIN-EATER. 
(8™ §S. viii. 288, 332.) 

There appeared in the Times of 18 Sept., 1895, 
a very interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of 
Oswestry, on the above subject. Armed with that 
letter, I spent half a day at the British Museum, 
and looked through everything that Mr. Thomas 
refers to as bearing on the matter. I was already 
familiar with Joseph Downes’s tale in the ‘ Moun- 
tain Decameron,’ but as I am no folk-lorist, that 
was about the extent of my own knowledge. It 
seems that the “authorities” for the alleged 
custom are (1) Aubrey ; (2) Mr. Matthew Mogg- 
ridge, of Swansea ; and (3) Pennant. 

The important statement as affecting South 
Wales is Mr. Moggridge’s, made at the sixth 
—s of the Cambrian Archeological Society 
at Ludlow on 28 August, 1852. 

After describing the custom Mr. Moggridge 

said that— 
“in Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, there was 
& mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of 
the present century, the people were of a very lawless 
character. There the practice was said to have pre- 
vailed to a recent period...... He believed that people 
were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he 
was informed, occurred a few yeara ago, but he believed 
it was extinct now.” 

Mr. E. A. Freeman inquired whether “sin- 
eater was the term used in the district where the 
custom prevailed?” Mr. Moggridge ‘‘ answered 
in the affirmative.” 

That statement seems to have passed un- 
challenged, although there were Welshmen actually 
present—the late Mr. Wynne, of Peniarth, for 
instance, and the present Bishop of St. David's. 

It is greatly to Freeman’s credit that his scent 
for “facts” was keener than the Welshmen’s, even 
on their own ground. ‘“‘Sin-eater” has never 
been adopted into the Welsh language, nor is 
there an equivalent term known in that language. 
And yet ‘Mr. Moggridge must have had some 
ground for his assertion. On the supposition that 
he was acquainted with the Rev. John Williams, 
who was vicar of Llandebie and Bettws from 1804 
to 1850, I think I can give a possible explanation. 
When, after Williams’s death in 1850, there 
was a sale of his effects at the vicarage, my father 
bought a large quantity of Welsh periodicals and 
books. Among these was Drych yr Amseroedd 
(Mirror of the Times), by the Rev. Robert Jones, 
of Rhoslan, Carnarvonshire. That little work was 
a great favourite of mine when I was a boy. Let 
me translate a short passage :— 

“ Inquirer: I remember my grandfather mentioning 
something called Diodlas or Diodles. Can you tell me 


what that was? abe

would be the recipient of that precious (lit. happy) dole 
the Diodles. The manner of bestowing it was as follows: 
the family would send a cup to the coffin-maker, to be 
painted of the same colour as the coffin (two colours 
were used in those times—black for married folk, white 
for the single); and when the day of the funeral arrived, 
after the body had been placed on the bier, the head of 
the family gave the alms to the poor person selected, 
that is to say, a big loaf of good bread, and a large chunk 
of cheese with a piece of silver stuck in it, and the 
painted cup full of ale (if ale there happened to be), 
otherwiee of milk, presenting them across the corpse to 
the poor person. 
fervent blessings and prayers for (lit. along with) the 
soul of the dead. It was customary for the entire house- 





he latter would utter devout and |

hold, on the first Sunday after the funeral, to go and | 


kneel on the grave, each saying the Lord’s Prayer 
(Pader). And they wou'd never mention any deceased 
member or relation of the family without saying very 
oy * Heaven be his portion’ (Nefoedd iddo /),”— 


This custom will be familiar to the reader already, 
no doubt, from Pennant’s ‘Tour’ (ii. p. 338, 
London, 1784) ; bat the Welsh name, and several 
graphic touches besides, are not to be found in 
Pennant’s description, which, by the way, is evi- 
dently derived from the same source as the account 
in the British Magazine for 1835 (vol. vii. p. 399), 
said there to be taken “from a MS. book of a 
bishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago.” 

I venture to suggest that it is this by no means 
repulsive old North Walian custom that has given 
rise to the myth of the sin-eater. The only Welsh 
terms for the alleged custom that Mr. Moggridge 
could possibly have heard are diodles and cwpan y 
meirw—both of them unknown in South Wales. 

Owen Pughe’s ‘ Welsh Dictionary’ (Gee, 1832) 

has, under Diawdlestr :— 
“A drinking cup; also a cup-full of drink, so called 
superstitiously, given for the dead, which in some places 
is called diawdlyst, and cwpan y meirw” (i,¢., the cup of 
the dead). 

“ Diawdlyst=the give-ale.” 

Canon Silvan Evans’s great ‘ Welsh Dictionary,’ 
now in course of publication, bas not yet, I believe, 
reached D. It does not mention cwpan y meirw. 

I was very well acquainted, when a boy, with a 
small farmer from what I must call the “ incri- 
minated district,” who used to be in great request 
as a post mortem barber. He would most cer- 
tainly have informed me of such a practice had 
it ever existed within his personal or traditional 
knowledge. 

I may add that the opening of the “lawless” 
valley mentioned lies between the two parishes of 
Liandebie and Bettws, and that Swansea is only 
some ten or twelve miles off. It is not only 
possible, but highly probable that the aged vicar 
Sook two parishes = — dwelt on the 

‘opish”” superstition described so hically in 
Jones of Rhoslan’s little book. wliee d 

At any rate, that is the only explanation I can 
suggest of the Cambrian Archzologists’ amusing 
“comedy of errors.” Mr, Sidney Hartland must 





i 


search somewhere else than in Lilandebie and 

Cwmamman for evidence in support of his “ canni- 

bal” theory. J. P. Owen. 
48, Comeragh Road, West Kensington. 


P.S.—Perhaps I may be allowed to add that the 
above was sent for publication to ‘N. & Q.’ before 
the appearance of Mr. Sidney Hartland’s first letter 
in the Academy (Nov., 1895), and that that gentle- 
man had it before him, in the form of a letter from 
me to Prof. Rhys, in October, 1895. 


The two customs mentioned under the above 
heading are, in reality, quite reconcilable. Accord- 
ing to a widely disseminated folk-belief, when 
a man dies his essential principles, moral or 
otherwise, may be taken over by some one else, 
the matter being managed in various ways in 
different parts of the world. Thus, among certain 
savage peoples a successful warrior banquets on 
the body of the enemy he has killed, in order 
to absorb his bravery and his other enviable 
characteristics. It is said that in ancient Mexico 
the captor was under obligation to offer up his 
captive at one of the solemn sacrificial feaste— 
an important reason for the custom being, pro- 
bably, that the prisoner's virtues as a man should 
be transmitted to the conqueror, though, from 
another point of view, no doubt the unfortunate 
sufferer was an earthly representative of the god to 
whom he was sacrificed. 

In most cases where transference of moral or 
vital powers is supposed to take place, the recipient 
is thought to benefit ; but this is not a necessary 
part of the belief. He may occupy the place of a 
scapegoat, as does the Welsh sin-eater, and take 
upon bimself all responsibility for the misdeeds of 
the deceased, although he more usually appro- 
priates the good qualities of the dead. The idea 
of freeing the defunct from his imperfections can 
scarcely be so ancient as the more selfish notion of 
seizing his virtues. It would seem to be an out- 
growth from the more egotistical belief, aided to 
some degree in development by the influence of 
religious or quasi-religious environment. 


The ceremony of sin-eating as it was formerly practised in Scotland is described at p. 60 of Mr. 
Phiselton Dyer’s ‘Domestic Folk-lore.’ If my 
memory serves me, there is a good deal of infor- 
mation on this subject in ‘The Golden Bough,’ by 
Mr. Frazer. Cc. C. B. 


Mr. Elton, in ‘Origins of English History,’ 
1882, pp. 181, 182, bas some interesting obser- 
vations on sin-eating. He says, “ The superstition 
certainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may 
be doubful whether it extended to the neighbour- 
ing parts of Wales.” He quotes Aubrey’s ‘ Re- 
mains of Gentilisme ’ (as every one writing on the 
subject does), and refers also to Sikes’s ‘ British

Sin-eating pure and simple has, I think, been 
obsolete in these islands now for some considerable 
period. An excellent article dealing with the 
whole matter appears in Folk-Lore, 1892, pp. 144- 
157, by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. He states, at 
p. 156, that the custom (of sin-eating in one form 
or another) was existent, or quite recently existed, 
among the Greeks and Scotcb, and possibly among 
the Dyaks and Gipsies. He quotes the incident 
which occurred in 1851 or 1852, when the custom 
was still prevalent in Wales, and gives a reference 
to the Archewologia Cambrensis, N.S., iii. (1852), 
330. A curious variant of the custom is men-

 SIN - EATER, 
(8 §, viii, 288, 332 ; ix. 109.) 

As the question of the sin-eater has come up in 
‘N. & Q.,’ and Mr. Owen has alluded in your issue 
of 8 Feb. to my letter to the Times in September 
last, I should be glad of an opportunity of making 
a few remarks on the subject. I should have pre- 
ferred to do so in the Academy, but the editor, 
after inserting Mr. Hartland’s letters, in which I 
was alluded to by name half a dozen times and 
challenged to explain various facts, published Mr. 
Owen’s reply without a word of explanation to 
myself. 

The original purpose of my letter to the Times 
was to dispute the evidence for the Llandebie case, 
and it was only incidentally that the general ques- 
tion of sin-eating was involved. 

The main objection to the Llandebie story is the 
evidence of the schoolmaster Rowlands, who states 
that cakes were not given at funerals there. If 
this is so it is difficult to see how the sin-eater 
could have existed; for it is argued that this 
custom of giving cakes was a survival of sin-eating, 
and we are asked to believe that the custom of 
giving cakes disappeared before the central figure, 
the sin-eater. 

The weakness of Mr. Moggridge’s ipse dixit is so 
apparent that I need not enlarge on it ; for, in the 
absence of any statement of how he came by his 
information, a story on his authority is worth no 
more than a statement in an anonymous letter, 
copied and published without investigation. 

I could not, even without the explicit denials 
which we have before us, attach any importance 
to such a story ; but when capable men, resident 
in the neighbourhood, not only fail to find the sin- 
eater, but vouch for facts actually inconsistent 
with the existence of the sin-eater at the spot 
within recent times, it seems absurd to consider 
the Llandebie case as coming under the head of 
facts for folk-lorists. 

It is singular that no one has ever been 
duced who has seen a sin-eater, or even spoken 
with any one who has seen one. If the sin-eater was 
in existence in 1852 or shortly before, it should be 
possible now (much more should it have been so in 
1877) to produce one who could give testimony of 
this nature. N. W. Tomas. 
New College, Eastbourne. 



Mr. Owen begins his remarks by saying that 
‘ there appeared in the Times of 18 Sept., 1895, a 
very interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of 
Oswestry, on the above subject.” He forgets to 
say that Mr. Thomas's letter was an attack on Mr. 
Hartland, to which the latter, inthe Times and the 
Academy, effectually replied.

hold Tales and Traditional Remains,’ p. 124 ; and 
as this has a material bearing on the subject, I 
will repeat it here :— 
“When you drink wine at a funeral every drop that 
ou drink is s sin which the deceased has committed. 
ou thereby take away the dead man’s sins and bear 
them yourself.” 


I can produce the informant from whom this 
curious piece of folk-lore was obtained. It was 
offered to me without any questioning when I was 
collecting folk-lore some years ago, and it is un- 
doubtedly genuine. It completes what Aubrey 
said about sin-eating; so that English folk-lore is 
acquainted not only with sin-eating but also with 
sin-drinking. It matters not whether such terms 
as “ sin-eating ” or “‘sin-drinking” can be proved 
to have existed in recent times. It is enough to 
show that the customs themselves existed ; and of 
this we have ample evidence. 

Taking the two customs together, one cannot 
help seeing a resemblance between them and the 
missa pro defunctis, or mass for the dead. For 
what is a ‘‘ mass” for the dead but a ‘‘ mess” or 
banquet for the dead? Prof. Skeat tells us that 
the Low Lat. missa “is usually accounted for by 
supposing that the allusion is to the words ite, missa 
est.” Bat this seems far-fetched and very impro- 
bable ; indeed, Prof. Skeat admits that the change 
of vowel from the Lat. ¢ to O.E. «@, as in meesse, 
M.E. messe, is remarkable. It is easy to trace the 
** mess,” or feast for the dead, in ancient custom. 
We may see it in the mass of All Hallows, or All 
Hallows Day (1 Nov.), of which, even to this day, 
a reminiscence is found in Yorkshire in the 
“tharf cakes” eaten during the first week of 
November. We may see it in the funeral cakes so 
commonly eaten during the present century. We 
may see it in the enormous feasts and in the mighty 
brewings of ale held and made after the death of 
the wealthy in the Middle-English period. And, 
going still further back, we may see it in the 

ken bones, with marrow extracted, scattered 
throughout so many prehistoric burial mounds in 
England.* From evidence thus presented it ap- 
peared to Dr. Thurnam that anthropophagism once 
prevailed in the British Isles, and he adduced some 
es from ancient writers in support of his 
opinion.t These were: Diodorus Siculus, v. 32; 
Strabo, iv. 5, 4; Plinius, vii. 2; Hieronymus adv. 
Jovianun, ii. 

If the explanation of “‘ mass” here offered be 
correct, it follows that every “feast” in the calendar 
is a commemorative banquet. The words of the 
Saviour, ‘‘ This doin remembrance of me,” may be 
compared, and also the minni, or memorial cup, at 
old northern sacrificer. S. O. Addy.
