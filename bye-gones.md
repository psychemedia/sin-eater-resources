A very interesting article from his peu was published in 
Blackwood' s Magazine for Nov. 1875, on “ Legends and 
Folk Lore of Wales,” which was the subject — or rather a 
passage in it was— of a hot controversy in The Academy. 
In the course of his paper the writer (he preserved his in- 
cognito throughout) had mentioned the superstition of 
“The Sin-Eater,” which attracted the attention of Pro- 
fessor Silvan Evans, who challenged the writer to produce 
proofs. Several letters were pub ished, and other scribes 
joined in the discussion ; some account of which will, pro- 
ably, shortly appear in the Red Dragon , issued by Daniel 
Owen and Co. of Cardiff.

QUERIES. 

THE SIN EATER. — You have more than once 
referred to the practice of Sin-Eating in Wales and the 
Borders, as resting only on the authority of Aubrey, and 
totally discredited by modern Welshmen. In an article I 
recently referred to as appearing in the Oswestry Advertizer 
for Sep. 22, 1858, something akin to the custom is men- 
tioned, by an intelligent correspondent, who describes the 
custom as ancient. He says “ Previous to a funeral, it 
was customary when the corpse was brought out of the 
house, and laid upon the elor, or bier, for the next of 
kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must 
be a female) to give over the coffin a number of white 
loaves, in a great dish, snd sometimes a well-made Welsh 
cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor 
persons. After that they presented in the same manner a 
cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of 
it immediately. When that was done all knelt down, and 
the Minister, if present, repeated the Lord’s Prayer.” Any 
reader who could quote his father or grandfather as an 
actual witness of a ceremony such as this, or even an 
approach to it, would confer a boon on Welsh Archaeo- 
logy ! H. B.

REPLIES. 

THE SIN EATER IN WALES (April 25, 1883.) 
The question has been asked in Bye-gones if some of the 
funeral customs within the memory of those now living 
do not point to a more pronounced ceremony on the part 
of our forefathers ? One writer states — but only on hearsay 
— that last century it was usual, when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and laid upon the Elor, or bier, 
for the next of kin of the feminine gender “ to give over 
the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and 
sometimes a Welsh cheese with a piece of money stuck in 
it, to certain poor persons. After which a cup of drink 
was presented also over the coffin, of which a little was 
to be drunk immediately. When this was done the 
minister knelt down and said the Lord’s Prayer.” No 
one has corroborated this from the definite information of 
father or grandfather ; but they have spoken of a more 
modified form of, perhaps, the same ceremony, within 
their own recollection. Less than half a century ago it 
was usual at every ‘ respectable ’ funeral to have made up 
into packets, a couple of bits of cake — one of rich plum, 
and the other plain — wrapped in black-edged paper 
and sealed with black wax. One of these was pre- 
sented to each of the invited guests, who took 
it home unopened. At funerals of less pretention a 
“large round biscuit, the size and form of an ordinary 
tea-saucer, inverted, took the place of the packet of cake. 
These were ‘served’ to each of the parties attending the 
funeral (by one of the most respectable men present) on 
a tray called the ‘Hand-board,’ or ‘Server.’ The cere- 
mony was gone through just before ‘ Raising the Body.’ 
After this the ‘ Tankard ’ of hot-spiced ale was offered to 
each person present. This was made of pewter, and had 
a lid : everyone was expected to take a sip.” In nar- 
rating this in Bye-gones of May 17, 1882, the writer also 
called attention to a note in the history of the parish of 
Llanfechain, published in Mont : Coll: by the Rev. Mad- 
dock Williams in 1872. He became rector in 1851, and 
found it was usual to allow one of the sacramental vessels

a silver flagon presented to the parish in 1691) to be used 
n place of the customary tankard — a custom he at once 
denounced, to the no small chagrin of the parishioners ! 
How far these customs form a lingering remnant of the 
Sin Eater, your readers must judge for themselves.

Co.. London, Kent and Co.) 1882? 1883?

p282

A correspondent calls attention to a curious scrap of folk lore 
occurring in the Kev. Paxton Hood's book on Chr^istrtiae Evans, 
the Preacher of Wild \Yale8y published a couple of years ago. 
According to the author " the superstition of the Sin-Eater is 
said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in 
Carmarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular supersti- 
tion was that when a person died the friends sent for the 
Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of 
salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person ; he then 
uttered an incantation over the bread, after which he proceeded 
to eat it, thereby eathifj the sins of the dead person. This 
done he received a fee of two-and -sixpence, which we suppose 
was much more than many a preacher received for a long and 
|)ainful service. Having received this he vanished as swiftly 
as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aiding 
his exit with blows and kicks and other indications of their 
faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since, 
and through the ages beyond that time, we suppose this curious 
superstition was everywhere prevalent.'' 

It would be difficult to say upon what ground the Rev, 
Paxton Hood founded the generalisation contained in the last 
sentence, unless it be that he is neither a close nor a profound 
reasoner. But what there ought to be no difficulty about is the 
])roof or disproof of the existence of the custom referred to in the 
vale of Cwm-Aman or in any other i)art of the Principality. 
It is a singular, and by no means creditable fact, that our 
acquaintance with things happening at our very doors should 
be so often the result of the observation of strangers. Contri- 
butions having for their subject any scrap of curious old Welsh 
customs or folk lore will be always welcome to the editor of the 
National Magazine. Perhaps in this matter of the " Sin-Eater,'* 
of which we should like to obt»m otViei «jad more authentic 
LITERARY AND ART NOTES. 283- 
i«formation than the Rev. Paxton Hood can give, some corres- 
pondent, like " Tal-a-hen," may come to our rescue.

Our March " note " anent the Carmarthenshire 8ui)er- 
stition of •* the Sin Eater " appears to have excited the liveliest 
curiosity. Letters asking for further information upon the 
subject have reached us from all quarters, including one from 
*' an American Reader." We have much pleasure in announcing 
that the Red Dragon for May will contain a paper, by a well- 
known Welsh antiquarian, explanatory of the extraordinary 
custom.

THE SIN EATER. 



There are two articles of belief connected \rith Wales and 
Welshmen that are firmly fixed in the minds of Englishmen all 
the world over. One of these is, that there is a village in 
Anglesey called LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwUtyssil- 
iogogogoch, and the other that there used to be a disreputable 
old party connected with most parishes, whose business it was 
to swallow the offences of his defunct neighlx)urs ; and who, 
accordingly, bore the ominous title of The Sin Eater. The 
latest reference I have seen to the village with the unpronoun- 
ceable name is in the South Australian Regiatei' of Jan. 27th, 
of this year ; and the most recent *' authority " for the 
superstition seems to be the Eev. Paxton Hood, who wrote a 
memoir of Christmas Evans a couple of years ago. But, first of 
all, let us see what the earliest known " authority " on the 
ijuestion has to say about it. John Aubrey, who flourished 
between 1626 and 1700, is the man to whom all later 
" historians " are indebted for their evidence of the prevalence 
of the custom. Poor old Aubrey has been dubbed by no less 
an authority than Gifi'ard " a credulous fool," and, truly, as 
another writer observes, " his power of discriminating truth 
from falsehood was by no means remarkable." 

As the substance of what Aubrey says. Brand, in his Popular 
AntiquitieSy quotes : " In the county of Hereford was an old 
oustome at Funeralls to hire 2>oor People, who were to take 
upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he 
was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Baskel) I remember 
lived in a Cottage in Kosse high-waye. The manner was, that 
when the Corps was brought out of the House, and layd on the 
Biere, a Ijoafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the 
Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowie of Maple, 
full of beer (which hee was to drinke up), and Sixe-pence in 
money: in considera'con whereof he tooke upon him, ipsofadiOf 
all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or ner fitom 
walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, 
something to the Scape-Goate in the olde Lawe." Aubrey goes 
on to say that though the custom was '^ rarely used in onie 
dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strietaflt 



THE SIN EATER. 451 

time of the Presbyterian Government." It was also observed 
at *' Brecon, and heretofore all over Wales." He instances a 
case at "Glangors, where Mr Gwin, the Minister, about 1640, 
could not hinder the ])erformance of this antient custome," and 
further remarks: "A.D. 1686. This custome is used to this 
daye in North Wales," where milk, he says, was the substitute 
for beer. 

Now this is positively all the evidence we have that such a 
custom ever prevailed in the Principality ; for although John 
Bagford (1717) tells (in Leland's CoU. /., Ixxvi.) of " an old sire," 
who was furnished " with a Cricket, on which he sat ; a Groat, 
which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of Bread, which he eat ; 
and a full bowle of ale, which he drank oflF at a draught," he 
does but copy Aubrey, upon whose text modern writers have 
founded homilies. Hone summarised most of the evidence in 
his Year Book. The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his Health and 
Education^ refers to the custom as an illustration of the 
perfonnances of the Orphic priests, to show that in all ages we 
are very much alike ; and adds, " Alas, poor human nature !" 
Dr. Downes wrote most graphically of the custom in his 
Mountain Decameron —laying the scene between Aberystwyth 
and Machjmlleth ; and others, "too numerous to mention," 
have given their versions of the practice, and specified the 
localities wherein it is observed ; but when these accounts are 
analysed, we invariably discern the " original sinner" to be the 
** long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskel " of the Ross 
highway. 

A very interesting discussion on this question took place in 
the Academy during the winter months of 1875-6, in 
consequence of an article in Blackioood on the ** Legends and 
Folk-Lore of Wales," in which the writer referred to the 
horrible custom of sin-eating. This attracted the attention of 
the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, who wrote as follows : — " The earlier 
portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived 
upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have 
never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as 
now existing or as having existed at some former period. I 
have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the 
land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact 
with funerals ; but I have never found a trace of such a 
custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is 
altogether xmknown in the Principality." This at once called 
forth replies, but no new facts were obtained; all that was 
written being but a repetition of Aubrey and his followers. 
As may be supposed, the Blackwood writer was amongst the 
correspondents, and he called Professor Evans' attention to the 
fiwjt that at the Ludlow meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological 
Society, in 1852, "Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this su^eratitvyoL 

D D 2 



452 THE SIX EATEK. 

as ha\nng occnrred within five years at or near Llandebie, in 
the hill country of Carmarthenshire/' and referred him to the 
Journal of the Society for the report. In the meanwhile 5Ir. 
Evans spareil no i^ains to collect evidence, and took up 
'' authorities," and giwe the result of his enquiries in the 
Academy of Jan. 29, 1876. First of all he quotes a portion of 
what !Mr. !Moggridge was reported to have said ; which was 
this : — *' In Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a 
mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the 
present centurj', the people were of a very lawless character. 
There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent 
period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, 
from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the 
people had more early become enlightened, he found the more 
absurd jx)rtious of the custom had been abandoned, while some 
still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the 
plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, 
indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt." It will be 
seen from the foregoing that no mention is made of ** within 
five years ;" and on this fact Mr. Evans comments, but the 
matter was afterwards explained by the Blackwood writer in a 
further quotation from Mr. Moggridge, which, however, he and 
Mr. Evans read different 1 v. 

In passing it will bt* interesting to note how old customs and 
legends get mixed up by modem historians ! Not a word is 
said by Aubrey about salt ; although the use of salt, in some 
form or other, at funerals, has not been disputed. But to return 
to Professor Evans's reply. In a private letter he received from 
Mr. Moggridge, that gentleman told him that he did "not 
remember anything that gives a date," adding that ** the only 
written account " of the Sin Eater, " from personal knowledge, 
is tliat of Aubrey, ' de Gentilisme.' " And as Aubrey did not 
profess to speak from personal knowledge, Mr. E\'ans justlj 
considered the matter as doubtful as ever. Llandebie itself was 
not unrepresented in the discussion. Mr. John liowlands, tbf 
schoolmaster there, wrote to the following effect in the Western 
Mail : — "I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and 
I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and 
the history of the parish ; its legends, customs and traditionSi 
And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, bat 
never heard of a Sin Eater ; in fact people there never gave 
cakes at funerals. I knew almost every parish in South Wales. 
I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs 
for the late Sir Thomas Phillipj^s. If such a custom had 
prevailed, I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in 
writing that it is a glaring untruth." The Eev. Rees Evaiu, 
vicar of the parish, also wrote at some length, in reply to a 
l«5tter from Mr. Silvan Evans. In the course of his conununicar 



THE SIN EATER. 453 

tion he says : — " One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, 
whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, 
told me that snch a custom, in his opinion, could not have 
appeared here at least for the last two hundred years, or he 
would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who 
lived to a great age." The conclusion the clergyman comes to, 
after the enquiries he makes amongst his parishioners, is, that 
** the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot 
be substantiated by any reliable authority, or proved by any 
credible evidence." 

Mr. Evans's lengthy communication drew forth from the 
writer in Blackwood an equally lengthy reply ; in the course of 
which he referred to himself as, "by parentage, ancestry, 
property, and interests, connected with two counties of South 
Wales." And he speaks of his frequent travels over the whole 
of the Principality ; so he felt competent to oflFer an opinion, 
although he had failed to "acquire the language." Before 
this letter appeared, I had joined in the discussion, and hinted 
that the author of the paper on the " Legends and Folk Lore of 
Wales " was a resident of the Herefordshire border ; and I now 
have no hesitation in saying that it was the late Prebendary 
Davies, of Moor Court, Kington, whose recent death all who are 
interested in Welsh literature and archaeology have to mourn. 
•His reply to Mr. Evans appeared on February 8th, and he 
quotes Murray's Hand-book to South Wales (edit. 1870), 
^ited by " a medical man of eminence " (as he believes), for 
the fact that " the superstition of the Sin Eater is said to have 
lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm- 
Amman, in Caermarthenshire." After which he goes on to 
say:—"! refer to the ordnance maps, and find Cvvm-Amman to 
lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the 
Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Vemey, in the current number 
of the Contemporary^ refers to the same superstition, and if the 
whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least 
singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that 
pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr, 
Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practice on their 
credulity, and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a 
point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up 
your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not 
easily removed from others which, in many nations, have 
simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. 
Grotius on I Cor. iv., 13, traces one such in Caesar's account of 
the Gauls (B. ix., 6). That is coming near to the Welsh, 
though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either 
ignorant or superstitious." 

In all this the jBfacti(;oo(Z writer gives no further "authority;** 
— for the editor of the Hand-book could scarcely be accouiLtj^^ 



454 THE SIN EATER. 

one — and Mr. Evans, in reply, obserN^es that " ^Ir. Moggridge, 
and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along 
that the plate and salt are necessary remnants of the alleged 
Sin Eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in 
certain cases, they take it for granted that ' the more odious 
part of the custom has been removed,' which amounts to 
begging the whole question." He considers " it is very kind, but 
slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to * refresh ' his 
memory respecting ' the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical 
scape-goat;'" and concludes by refusing to give credit to any 
statement on the authority of " so credulous a person as Aubrey, 
in any case in which superstition plays a part." Here the 
discussion ended, as far as the principals were concerned. 
Another discussion was carried on in the " Shreds and Patches ^ 
column of the ShreivahuTij Joitrnal a year or two later ; and on 
more than one occasion the superstition has been referred to in 
the " Bye-gones " column of the Oswestry Advertiser. Mr. 
Wirt Sykes goes very fully into the question in his British 
Ooblins^ and comes to the conclusion that " no other writer of 
Aubrey's time, either English or Welsh, appears to have made 
any reference to the Sin Eater in Wales; and equal silence 
prevails throughout the writings of previous centuries." And 
as to later " authorities," Mr. Sykes failed to discover one who 
wrote in the Welsh language, ** a singular omission if there • 
ever was such a custom, for concerning every other 8U]>erstitious 
practice commonly ascribed to Wales, the Welsh have written 
freely." 

And now, when we might reasonably have expected that the 
Sin Eater had been laid for ever, appears the Rev. Paxton 
Hood's book — referred to in the March number of the Bed 
Dragon. Mr. Hood is a very pleasant writer, but he is too 
impulsive for an antiquary. It was only in 1876 that he 
gave a glowing picture of Llanidloes, " the home of the really 
great poet, John Dyer," and told us of " Grongar Hill, a 
delicious spot in that neighbourhood ! " Now he sets up an 
imaginary being in the district of Cwm-Amman ; and only varies 
the words of Mr. Murray's editor by remarking that the 
superstition " is said to linger even now," instead of (as Murray 
has it), " is said to have lingered until very recently," in that 
happy valley ! Mr. Hood's assertion was copied into Notes and 
Queries in January last, and will, doubtless, be accepted as 
gospel by a goodly number; but unfortunately for him, his book 
on Christmas Evans attracted the attention of a brother minister 
in the same Cwm-Amman Vale, who promptly wrote to the 
Christian World to repudiate the whole story.
