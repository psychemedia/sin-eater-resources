Bye-gones, relating to Wales and the border counties.

February 1882

THE SHROPSHIRE ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.
(From the Oswestry Advertizer , Feb. 15, 1882.)


Mr. Paxton Hood has made a discovery which many more experienced archaeological authorities have sought after, and failed in the search. In a life of the Rev. Christmas Evans, he has recently written, he tells us that there still exists in Caermarthenshire "the Sin Eater," a personage once universal in Wales. We thought that belief was finally scotched in the Academy discussion a few years ago. Such an accommodating official does not and never did exist in Wales, and the only authority (?) for supposing that one ever existed on the borders was old Aubrey, who tells of a "leane, hungry raskel" in Herefordshire.

POPISH CEREMONIES STILL EXISTING IN WALES.

The Rev. Canon Richards said, in his lecture at St. Joseph's, Swansea, on the recent Church Congress, that the old faith, or Popery, still lingers in men's hearts and memories, and that even now the people retain in Wales many practices once belonging to the old religion. That this is so amongst the members of the Established Church is an acknowledged fact, but that such practices still exist amongst the Welsh Nonconformists may at the first be questioned. I have long observed these strange but contradictory rites with no small interest, and possibly the pointing of them out may lead others to the same line of observation.

I will first confine myself to death and burial rites. We have much that surrounds these events that must have come down to us from the times when the holy fathers were the masters of the ceremonies.

*The Gwylnos*, or watchnight, or "Wake," is still an important service in some parts of Wales, and the form of procedure varies in several localities. This takes place on the night preceding the funeral. The neighbours and friends meet about 7 p.m. in the room wherein the body has been laid. The walls of the chamber or room being covered over with linen sheets with laurel leaves pinned on to the sheets, two leaves so placed that they take the form of the letter T or a cross, at the head and feet of the body are placed a lighted candle. In a Nonconforming neighbourhood on the borders of Pembroke, Cardigan, and Carmarthen counties, it was customary up to within 30 years, to put a lighted candle on a plate placed on the chest of the body during the *Gwylnos*, whilst placing a plate full of salt on the body was pretty general in Montgomeryshire at one time. When the friends had arrived a portion of Scripture was read and hymns sung, and prayers offered alternately with the hymns ; when, about 9 o'clock, after several friends had offered up prayer, the *Gwylnos* closed, and the friends returned to their several homes. To bury without a *Gwylnos* was considered a mark of great disrespect to the relatives and to the departed.

When Anne Griffiths of Dolwar fach, the great hymnologist, attended a funeral of a relative of the writer's she at once proceeded to the room where, on a bed, the body lay, When kneeling at the bedside she offered up a long silent prayer. At the same funeral the husband of the departed one caused a near relative to distribute a large sum of money amongst the poor people that had come to receive the dole that was thus divided previous to the "lifting of the body;" otherwise taking the body from the house to be buried. It is also customary to read a portion of Scripture and to pray, the body having been first brought from the room and placed on chairs, or on the bier at the door of the house. On starting from the house the company of mourners raise up their voices in a mournful hymn, and they continue singing for some distance as they leave the house. On approaching the church another hymn is sung, until the body is borne near to the Lych gate, where the officiating minister meets the funeral procession, the bells, as the funeral approaches the church, ringing the funeral toll. After the service is concluded in the church, the friends make an offering to the clergyman, this being made on a special table fixed to the altar railing. At the grave, again, another offering is made, on the sexton’s spade. Every one attending where the offering custom prevails is expected to uphold, as in duty bound, the usage, by contributing his quota. Formerly on retiring from the grave, which had been decorated with the laurel and box evergreens, friends retired to the village ale-house, sometimes called the "Church House," or "Ty’n-y-llan," where it was the custom to drink the "funeral ales" to the comfort of the relatives and the profit of the landlord, who, in no very remote times, was commonly the parish clerk. The first Sunday following the burial of the dead was called the "funeral Sunday," or the "second burial Sunday," when a special service was held, a funeral sermon delivered, and the departed largely received the encomiums of the minister, and the relatives were publicly "prayed for." At the close of the service I have known the relatives go to the grave, and there kneel for some time.

Another ceremony of some peculiarity, but now nearly obsolete, is *Gwylio y Corph* (watching the body). This is simply the sitting up all night in the room wherein the body is laid, of one or more of the neighbours who volunteers to do this duty. And this is done each succeeding night from death until burial. Drink at one time must have been freely supplied to the *Gwyliwr*, or watchman, hence the adage, "Hawdd yf a wyl ei wely." "He who watches his resting place will drink freely."

So much was the "drink" considered as part of the ceremonies at death and burial, that a special drink — strong home-brewed ale, strongly flavoured with spice and lemon — was provided, in a special vessel called a tankard. This was "served" with the "funeral cakes" just before starting with the body from the house. The Rev. W. Maddock Williams, in his interesting sketch of the parish of Llanfechain says, in reference to this custom, in describing the sacramental vessels belonging to the church, "It had long been the custom to permit it (the large flagon) to be used at funerals in the parish, for the purpose of handing out to each of the attendants on the occasion the spiced drink, wine or ale, as the case may be. Such a desecration of the sacred vessel was peremptorily resisted by the present Rector (the Rev. M. Williams) at his entrance upon the incumbency, but not without his incurring much obloquy, and giving much offence." (Mont: Coll: vol. v.)

Dr. Ollivant, the late Bishop of Llandaff, forms the subject of the memoir and portrait in the Red Dragon for March. ... That disreputable old fellow, “The Sin Eater,” who we thought was killed long ago, has, it seems, only been scotched, for he crops up again in the number before us !

The late Prebendary Davies.

In our paper of Mar. 14 we briefly announced the death of this gentleman. In the Hereford Times of Mar. 17 there was the following somewhat extended notice : —

We regret to announce the death of the Rev. James Davies, M.A., Prebendary of Hereford, at his residence, Moorcourt, near Kington, on Sunday last, in his 63rd year. Mr Davies was the second son of Mr Richard Banks of Kington, and was educated at Repton School and Lincoln College, Oxford, being a scholar on this foundation. He obtained a 3rd class "in Literis Humanioribus" in 1844, and subsequently proceeded to his B A. and M.A. degrees. He was ordained deacon in 1845 and priest in 1846 by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and held the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Forest of Dean, from 1847 to 1852. He was headmaster of King Edward's school, Ludiow, from 1852 to 1857 ; in the following year he succeeded his uncle at Moorcourt, when he assumed the surname of Davies by royal licence. He was a magistrate for the counties of Hereford and Radnor, and in 1875 he was appointed to the Prebendal Stall of Moreton et Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. He took an active interest in county and diocesan business ; amongst other things, the Church Building Society, diocesan inspection of schools, the Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, the Woolhope Club, and all local questions in and around Kington. For 21 years he regularly served a chapel of ease to the parish of Pembridge, erected by him at Moor Court. In a still wider circle he will be remem-bered in the literary world as the author of several classical works, and as a constant contributor to periodical literature, notably in the "Quarterly," "Contemporary," and "Saturday Reviews," "Blackwood’s Magazine," &c. In the neighbourhood of his home, where he was held in high esteem by all, the deceased gentleman’s death has occasioned deep sorrow ; and it is certain that a keen sense of grief will be felt throughout the large area in which he was so well known and so much respected.

The papers contributed by the deceased gentleman to the periodicals named were largely topographical. Thus in the* Saturday Review* he published one on the Upper Wye, in 1872 ; on Montgomeryshire, in 1874 ; and on The Breiddeu Hills, in 1881. The last has an interesting history for some of our readers. Mr. Davies was on a visit to Mr. Morris Jones at Gungrog, and during the visit his host invited a small party to accompany his guest for a walk over the Breidden range ; an invitation we have never ceased to regret being unable to accept. The trip, as Mr. Davies put it in his subsequent paper, was "an endeavour at determining the locality of the last battle of the Silurian hero Caractacus, with his Roman Conqueror Ostorius;" and the paper was afterwards rewritten for the *Montgomeryshire Collections* of the Powys-Land Club.

Mr. Davies was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, and a contributor to its journal. He wrote a very pleasant account, in the *Saturday Review*, of its excursion in 1874, under the title of "With the Cambrians at Wrexham"; and in 1881, he contributed a record of the Church Stretton meeting to *The Academy* , a record he afterwards amplified for the *Oswestry Advertizer*, from which paper it was transferred to the pages of the Shropshire Archaeological Society.

A very interesting article from his pen was published in *Blackwood's Magazine* for Nov. 1875, on "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales," which was the subject — or rather a passage in it was— of a hot controversy in *The Academy*. In the course of his paper the writer (he preserved his incognito throughout) had mentioned the superstition of "The Sin-Eater," which attracted the attention of Professor Silvan Evans, who challenged the writer to produce proofs. Several letters were published, and other scribes joined in the discussion ; some account of which will, probably, shortly appear in the *Red Dragon*, issued by Daniel Owen and Co. of Cardiff.

QUERIES.

THE SIN EATER. — You have more than once referred to the practice of Sin-Eating in Wales and the Borders, as resting only on the authority of Aubrey, and totally discredited by modern Welshmen. In an article I recently referred to as appearing in the *Oswestry Advertizer* for Sep. 22, 1858, something akin to the custom is mentioned, by an intelligent correspondent, who describes the custom as ancient. He says "Previous to a funeral, it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the elor, or bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a well-made Welsh cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented in the same manner a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that was done all knelt down, and the Minister, if present, repeated the Lord’s Prayer." Any reader who could quote his father or grandfather as an actual witness of a ceremony such as this, or even an approach to it, would confer a boon on Welsh Archaeology !

REPLIES.

THE SIN EATER IN WALES (April 25, 1883.) The question has been asked in Bye-gones if some of the funeral customs within the memory of those now living do not point to a more pronounced ceremony on the part of our forefathers ? One writer states — but only on hearsay — that last century it was usual, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the *Elor*, or bier, for the next of kin of the feminine gender "to give over the coffin a number of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a Welsh cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After which a cup of drink was presented also over the coffin, of which a little was to be drunk immediately. When this was done the minister knelt down and said the Lord’s Prayer." No one has corroborated this from the definite information of father or grandfather ; but they have spoken of a more modified form of, perhaps, the same ceremony, within their own recollection. Less than half a century ago it was usual at every 'respectable' funeral to have made up into packets, a couple of bits of cake — one of rich plum, and the other plain — wrapped in black-edged paper and sealed with black wax. One of these was presented to each of the invited guests, who took it home unopened. At funerals of less pretention a "large round biscuit, the size and form of an ordinary tea-saucer, inverted, took the place of the packet of cake. These were 'served' to each of the parties attending the funeral (by one of the most respectable men present) on a tray called the 'Hand-board,' or 'Server.' The ceremony was gone through just before 'Raising the Body.' After this the 'Tankard' of hot-spiced ale was offered to each person present. This was made of pewter, and had a lid : everyone was expected to take a sip." In narrating this in Bye-gones of May 17, 1882, the writer also called attention to a note in the history of the parish of Llanfechain, published in *Mont : Coll :* in 1872. He became rector in 1851, and found it was usual to allow one of the sacramental vessels a silver flagon presented to the parish in 1691) to be used in place of the customary tankard — a custom he at once denounced, to the no small chagrin of the parishioners ! How far these customs form a lingering remnant of the Sin Eater, your readers must judge for themselves.
