<p>In the years that followed the second controversy, references to the sin-eater typically started to fade away, except as the occasional historical note or curiosity. As the new century began, we see one such echo of the “legend” of the sin-eater appear, only to be challenged by return of post.</p>

<p>“SIN-EATERS.”</p>
<p>At funerals in some parts of Wales there is a curious custom. A poor person is hired to perform the duties of sin-eater. Bread and beer are passed to the man over the corpse, or laid on it; these he consumes, and by the process he is supposed to take on him all the sins of the deceased and free the person from walking after death. When a sin-eater is not employed, glasses of wine and funeral biscuits are given to each bearer across the coffin. The people believe that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, but that by drinking the wine the soul of the dead is released from the burden of the sin.</p>

<p>TO THE EDITOR OF “THE ECHO.” The Sin-Eater in Wales,</p>
<p>Sir,—You print in Saturday’s ” Echo” a paragraph, entitled “Sin Eaters.” I believe this to be a gross libel against the intelligence of the Welsh people. If the Welsh are living in Paganism such a practice might possibly exist but knowing by experience the high standard of life and religious practice of the Welsh in all parts of Wales, both in towns and in the remoter districts, I challenge in toto the assertion that at Welsh funerals any person ever acts the part if a sin eater as described in your paragraph. JOHN SAMUEL. Ealing.</p>
</div>
<p>That said, the “fakelore” around the story did continue to evolve, as the previous example shows with its mention that <em>“[t]he people believe that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased, but that by drinking the wine the soul of the dead is released from the burden of the sin”</em>.</p>
<p>A few short years later, in 1904, we also see a report claiming that Professor Silvan Evans had actually seen a sin-eater whan he was a child:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">An encounter with the sin-eater as a child?</p>
<p><em>Welsh Gazette and West Wales Advertiser</em> — <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3865588/3865596/88/">3rd March 1904, p8</a>:</p>
<p>The Sin eater is the title of the book just finished by Allen Raine, and now ready for publication in the autumn. It deals with an old Welsh custom, long since extinct The office or function of the Sin eater was a real one, and so late as the year 1825, there was living near Llanybyther, an aged man, known as the Sin eater. The late Professor Evans who died a few months ago, had seen him when a lad, and could remember hearing people talk of the custom, which had been one of ordinary occurrence in their parents’ days whenever a death took place.</p>
</div>
<p>The sin-eater story  was also touched upon in a series of lectures given in the 1907 MacCullum Lectures presented by the Rev. Dr Henderson on Celtic funeral and death rites:</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><em>Celtic Funeral Ritual and Death Rites</em>, March, 1907</p>

Oban Times and Argyllshire Advertiser - Saturday 23 March 1907
THE MACCALLUM LECTURES. CELTIC FUNERAL RITUAL AND DEATH RITES. The fourth leture of the public course on ” Survivals in Belief and Rituals among the Celts ” was delivered on Saturday by Rev. Dr. George Henderson in the Greek Class-room of Glasgow University. It dealt with the funeral ritual and rites pertaining to death and the dead. It was necessary at this stage, said Dr. Henderson, to bear in mind the noble words of Goethe that only a part of what is important is useful ; in order to possess a thing completely, to have full mastery over it, one must study it for its own sake. The lecturer pointed out that the explanation in the previous lecture of a cortain moment in folk belief whereby birth was due, not to sex, but to the passing of a ” spirit part ” from the parent was confirmed by the Punjab practice as to the first born. If a son, his father is born again in him, so that the father is supposed to die at his birth; while certain sections the father’s funeral rites were performed four months ere the child was born. An old rite of milk baptism and the simulating of the dead as living was touched upon. Discussing the<br />
RITUAL OF THE DEAD<br />
among the Celts, Dr. Henderson asked whether several theories of the soul might not be inferred from the various practices and old customs known to have existed. Reserving customs poin(-iﬁ 1o the Elysian theory of the soul, as well as such as might point to a possible sidereal theory for another occasion, he specified rites which were explicable on the earthly theory. Some of these might not be Celtic in origin. Yet the inconsistencies of folk belief were notorious, in no province more so than that in which the folk-mind attained to the finding of the soul. The earthly theory was connected, chiefly but not exclusively perhaps, with interment. Old death dances and curious practices at lyke wakes were discussed ; the “tathaich ” or ” coming back ” of the spirit was instanced ; also Faire Chlaidh or churchyard sentry incumbent on the spirit of the last buried. The liturgy of lustration, the setting aside of water for the dead, was compared with similar customs in Greece and elsewhere. Beliefs connected with the shroud were spoken of. The coronach, the “druidsi,” the ” Coscais,” the Highland “Aog,” the Breton “Ankou,” the “Sin-Eater” of Wales, the Highland custom of putting salt on the corpse, a rite widely diffused elsewhere—all these were practices which pointed to the lively belief that<br />
LIFE WAS NOT EXTINGUISHED<br />
with the mysterious corporeal change of death. A thought connection of the activity of folk-spirit was here discernible; the dust of antique time lay thick round these rites. If some of these were explicable on the earthly theory of the soul, they included the continuance of life as a protracted duration; on one view of the water left apart for the dead such continuance was at one time felt to be dependent on earthly support. There was likewiso an inner content which in symbol pointed to the idea of continuous and active spirit. The virtues of the dead were transmissible to the survivors through sacrament.</p>

REV. DR. HENDERSON’S CELTIC LECTURES. Rev. Dr. Henderson, in the fifth of his present course of Celtic lectures, delivered in the Greek Class-room at Glasgow University, on Saturday afternoon, continued the discussion of the death and funeral rites among the Celts. He pointed out in regard to the custom of sineating, that those practices were not confined to the Highlands. They existed in ancient Greece, and at the present day in Macedonia, of old in the south of Scotland, and especially in Wales and parts of England and Ireland. At the present day the custom did not exist in the Highlands, but the survivals still existed there. He read a series of extracts from a work on “ Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme,” published by Aubrey, an English writer, who lived in the seventeenth century. In that work the curious custom of the sin-eater, formerly observed in Wales, was referred to in speaking of offertories at funerals. At a meeting of the Cambrian Archaological Association at Ludlow in 1852, Llandebie, near Swansea, was specified as a place where<br />
THE CUSTOM HAD SURVIVED<br />
to within a recent period. It was stated that when a person died the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon thesalt a picce of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received a feo of half a crown, and vanished as quickly as possible from the public gaze ; for, as it was believed that he had really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom ho performed the ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood, regarded as a mere Pariah—as one irredeemably lost. The custom as practised among the Lowland Scots was known as dishaloof. Dr. Henderson cited instances of the custom as once practised in Yorkshire, in Bavaria, and in Turkestan. One might think, he said, that such a rite as of sin-eating would soon pass away. But a case had been observed in England as recently as 1893.</p>

<p>Dr. Henderson concluded his lecture by briefly referring to the ritual of sacrifice, and stated that in the next lecture he would give some instances of propitiation.</p>

THE “SIN EATER” AT CELTIC FUNERALS. In his fifth Celtic lecture at Glasgow University on Saturday, the Rev. Dr Henderson continued the discussion of the death and funeral rites of the Celts. He mentioned the curious custom of the “sin-eater,” traces of which, though not the rite itself, lingered in the Highlands. At a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Ludlow in 1852, Llandebie, near Swansea, was specified as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period. When a person died the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received a fee of half a crown, and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze; for as it was believed that he had really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood, regarded as a mere Pariah—as one irredeemably lost. The custom as practised among the Lowland Scots was known as dishaloof. Dr Henderson cited instances of the custom as once practised in Yorkshire, in Bavaria, and in Turkestan. One might think, he said, that such a rite as that of sin-eating would soon pass away. But a case had been observed in England as recently as 1893.</p>

<p>Several years later, the sin-eater then made a re-appearance in the pages of “Precious Bane”, a novel by Mary Webb that appeared in 1924.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Review of “Precious Bane”, Daily News, 1924</p>
<p><em>Daily News</em> (London) — <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0003212/19240814/117/0006">Thursday 14 August 1924, p6</a></p>
<p>LIFE IN SHROPSHIRE, MRS WEBB’S NEW NOVEL By ROSE MACAULAY,</p>
<p>” Precious Bane.” By Mary Webb. Cape. 7s. 6d.</p>
<p>Mrs. Webb’s new novel is a romance of Shropshire farm life of a century ago. The story is told by Prudence Sam, a farmer’s daughter, who, besides being unfortunate in her appearance (she has a hare lip, and is never allowed to forget it), is unlucky indeed in her male relatives. Her father, whose custom it was on Sunday evenings to flog his children for forgetting the sermon, dies a violent death early in the story at the hands of his son, who inherits the farm, drives his mother and sister to labour like serfs in the field, and himself toils unceasingly to get rich. It is a tragic tale, for Gideon’s pursuit of gold leads to the sacrifice of all he has held dear (including his sweetheart, whom he seduces and jilts, and his old mother, whom he poisons with foxglove tea) and finally to his own ruin.</p>
<p>The attraction of the story lies, however, not in Gideon’s tragedy, nor in the love story of Prudence, but in its characteristically beautiful telling, and in its pictures of old country customsthe hiring fair, the harvest home, the midnight funeral, with its ancient rite of sin-eating, the rosemary and flaming torches flung into the grave, the tankard full of elderberry wine set on the coffin at the grave-side. ‘Parson came forward and took it up, saying, ‘I drink to the peace of him that’s gone.’ Then everybody came in turn, and drank good health to father’s spirit.”</p>
<p>Whether the funerals of Shropshire farmers in the early years of the 19th century were really like this, we do not know, and do not greatly care. Nor do we know if yokels of any period talked or wrote letters quite as these do; but this is a doubt inspired by the conversation of practically all yokels in fiction. And in this case all improbabilities are made natural by the fact that they are narrated as the memories of her youth by an old lady of small education. No one who has ever heard such old ladies relate past conversations will be surprised at Prue Barn’s no doubt romantic embroiderings. In any case. all fiction about peasants is, for some reason, romantic. Mrs. Webb accepts this convention, but makes of it, as might be expected, a very poetic and charming book.</p>
</div>
<p>Most notable for the purposes of our tale is one chapter in particular (<em>Chapter 4: Torches and Rosemary</em>), where a funeral scene recounting the activities of a sin-eater is described. The phrase used by the sin-eater in taking on the souls of deceased in this purely fictional account is given as: <em>‘I give easement and rest now to the, dear man. Come not down the lanes nor in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen.’</em> Echoes of <em>“the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul”</em> and of being <em>“freed from walking after they were dead”</em> are both clear to see.</p>

TH: lots of clour in this, also:
Rather surprisingly, the practice of sin-eating seems to have persisted into relatively modern times, only dying out in the nineteenth century. In 1825, a Professor Evans of the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen, Wales, described a sin-eater he had met as follows: “Abhorred by the superstitious villagers as a thing unclean, the sin-eater cut himself off from all social intercourse with his fellow creatures by reason of the life he had chosen; he lived as a rule in a remote place by himself, and those who chanced to meet him avoided him as they would a leper. This unfortunate was held to be the associate of evil spirits, and given to witchcraft, incantations and unholy practices; only when a death took place did they seek him out, and when his purpose was accomplished they burned the wooden bowl and platter from which he had eaten the food handed across, or placed on the corpse for his consumption.”</p>

<div><p>THE WENDY HUT
INTRODUCING THE HUT FOLK</p>
<p>HELLO MY DEARS! Want to know a little about the Wendy Hut and its inhabitants—the folk who are going to amuse you in your own special corner of the paper?</p>
<p>So, you shall ! I’ll introduce us.</p>
<p>The Wendy Hut is in the “Land-of-I-Dunno-Where.” It Is a jolly little hut, with a big garden all around, woods in the background, and a gentle tinkling stream running through it.</p>
<p>Inside the Hut is a big room called “Happy Hall,” where we all meet together, and where our friends are always welcome. Each one the Hut folk has a little separate room opening out of “Happy Hall,” and at the back is our Cookle’s own domain— the kitchen.</p>
<p>I’m telling you about the Hut because I want you to picture it when you write to us, and send in entries for all the Competitions we’re going to organise for you.</p>

<p>Turning to the children’s section of the paper, on page 4 of the edition of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002076/19340911/095/0004">Tuesday, September 11th, 1934</a>, we find the following rather saccharine tale:</p>
<p>Thus far, I haven’t been able to find any other reference to “Simon the Missionary”, and the tale does rather take the form of a parable that might be used as the basis for a children’s sermon. For example, Simon as a child seems unconcerned that the sins could actually be transferred to him, although the rest of society <em>does</em> start treat him as a pariah. On reaching adulthood, he stops the practice that so offended his peers, accepting, perhaps, that he had been transgressing in some way, and seeing fit to then redeem himself by the proxy of atone for the sins of others that he had taken on himself. Do we read this as Simon falling in with a bad lot, being led by others, believing “but *I’m” not doing anything wrong”, then perhaps realising his bad ways and deciding to help others less fortunate than himself — <em>“there but for the grace of God go I?”</em> — redeeming not what he perceived as his own indiscretions, necessarily, presumably believing himself to be essentially good at heart, but those who had led him astray?</p>
<p>In recent years, the sin-eater tradition has appeared in several literary works, including and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.megancampisi.com/sin-eater">“The Sin Eater”</a> by Megan Campisi, 2022 [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/fiction/megan-campisi-on-the-sin-eater">interview</a>]</p>
