Previous to a funeral, it was customary, when 
the corpse was brought out of the house and laid

upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mo- 
ther, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) 
to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, 
in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a 
piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. 
After that they presented, in the same manner, a 
cup of drink, and required the person to drink a 
little of it immediately. When that was done, they 
kneeled down; and the minister, if present, said 
the Lord's Prayer: after which, they proceeded 
with the corpse; and at every cross-way, between 
the house and the church, they layed down the 
bier, knelt, and again repeated the Lord's Prayer; 
and did the same when fchey first entered the 
church-yard. It is also customary, in many places, 
to sing psalms on the way; by which the still- 
ness of rural life is often broken into, in a manner 
finely productive of religious reflections. 

To this hour, the bier is carried by the next of 
kin; a custom considered as the highest respect 
that filial piety can pay to the deceased. This 
was a usage frequent among the Romans of high 
rank; and it was thought a great continuance of 
the good fortune which had attended Metellus 
Macedonicus through his whole being, that when he 
had, in the fulness of years, passed out of life by a 
gentle decay, amidst the kisses and embraces of his 
nearest connections, he was carried to the funeral

me add, that each of them had enjoyed the greatest 
offices of the commonwealth 1 . 

Among the Welsh it was reckoned fortunate 
for the deceased if it should rain while they were 
carrying him to church, that his bier might be wet 
with the dew of heaven. 

In some places it was customary for the friends 
of the dead to kneel, and say the Lord's Prayer 
over the grave, for several Sundays after the inter- 
ment; and then to dress the grave with flowers.
