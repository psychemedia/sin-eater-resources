There is a strange superstition concerning the “sin-eater.”
which remains in some secluded places, perhaps the echo of the
idea of substitution for sin in the Jewish scapegoat. He presents
himself, professionally, at the moment of death, puts a plate con-
taining bread and salt on the breast of the corpse, mutters an
incantation, and proceeds to eat the bread, thereby “eating up
the sins of the dead,” and especially preventing him, or her,
from “walking” after death. The man who exercises this tre-
mendous power is a sort of pariah, detested in the neighbourhood,
and does his work for half-a-crown, and sometimes even goes as
low as sixpence in his demands. -
Another instance of the extraordinary power which, it is sup-
posed, can be exerted by very ordinary individuals, is accomplished
by throwing oneself on one's knees and repeating the Cursing
Psalms, when the dreadful wishes of David for his enemies are
made to cling to the person thus prayed against. “The devil can
quote Scripture” indeed. This Pagan and devilish use of the
Bible, and the change of name, not of nature, which has taken
place in many an ancient local deity, may still be met with in
Brittany, where there was a Celtic goddess of Hate, now trans-
mogrified into “Notre Dame dela Haine.” If three Ares are uttered
at nightfall in her chapel near Treguier, winged with the proper
directions against the hated person, “death happens irrevocably
within the year to him or her.”
