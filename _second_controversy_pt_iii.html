<h1>Second Controversy, 1896, Part III<a class="headerlink" href="#second-controversy-1896-part-iii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As 1895 rolled into 1896, Peter Ditchfield published a work on <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/studentshistoryo00gardrich/page/202/mode/2up?q=%22sin+eater%22">Old English customs extant at the present time; an account of local observances</a>. At p202, he described various burial customs, such as those that could be found in the county of Yorkshire:</p>
<blockquote id="oecdf">
<div><p>Burial Customs</p>
<p>In Yorkshire it is customary after a death to send to the friends of the family a bag of biscuits, together with a card bearing the name of the deceased. Sometimes these “funeral biscuits” are small round sponge-cakes, and were formerly known as arvel bread- arvel or arval being the ale or feast of the heir when he succeeds to his father’s property. [Cf. ” Forty Years in a Moorland Parish,” Canon Atkinson, p. 228. 2O2 ] This is a relic of the old pagan funeral feasts, and is not unknown in other parts of England. It is probably connected with the curious custom of the Sin-eater, formerly observed in Wales. A poor person was hired (one of them is described as “a long, lean, ugly, lamentable rascal”) to perform the duties of Sin-eater. Bread and beer were passed to the man over the corpse, or laid on it ; these he consumed, and by this process was supposed to take on him all the sins of the deceased, and free the defunct person from walking after death. The eaters of funeral biscuits in modern times little reflect upon the extraordinary superstition of which these dainties are a relic.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also described the Market Drayton tradition described by Gertrude Hope in her <span class="xref myst">letter</span> to <em>Folklore</em> in 1892 and corrected by Hartland in his <a class="reference internal" href="_second_controversy_pt_ii.html#secondcontrov-academy-hartland-firstreply"><span class="std std-ref">first reply</span></a> in the <em>Academy</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At a funeral near Market Drayton in 1893, the body was brought downstairs, a short service was performed, and then glasses of wine and funeral biscuits were handed to each bearer across the coffin. The clergy-man, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed, and that he had put an end to it in his former cure. Mr. E. Sydney Hartland has recently maintained in <em>The Times</em> that the custom of the Sin-eater still exists in Wales, and mentions the current belief in Derbyshire that every drop of wine drunk at a funeral is a sin committed by the deceased. Hence wine is drunk at the funerals in order to release the soul of the dead from the burden of sin. At Padiham, wine and funeral biscuits are always given before the funeral, and the clergyman is always expected to go to the house, and hold a service before the funeral party goes to church. Arval bread is eaten at funerals at Accrington, and there the guests are expected to put one shilling on the plate used for handing round the funeral biscuits.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the end of January, in the <em>Merthyr Times and Dowlais Times and Aberdare Echo</em>, a paragraph in the <em>By The Way</em> column, <a class="reference external" href="https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3099107/3099112/44/">p5</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>BY THE WAY.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The controversy about the Sin-eater in Wales is still going on merrily in the columns of the Academy. In the last number Mr. Hartland, metaphorically speaking, pulls Mr. J. P. Owen to pieces.</p>
<p>…</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="the-correspondence-moves-to-notes-queries">
<h2>The Correspondence Moves to Notes &amp; Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#the-correspondence-moves-to-notes-queries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The correspondents in the <em>Academy</em> now appeared to take a break, perhaps as a result of Owen licking his wounds following Hartland’s response in the second half of January, 1896. However, what at first looks like a new front of attack then opened up in <em>Notes &amp; Queries</em>. A question had been raised back in the <a class="reference internal" href="_triggering_second_controversy.html#nandq-oct95"><span class="std std-ref">October 10th, 1895</span></a> issue by a certain Mr Jonas, presumably in response to reports of the British Association meeting, but there had been no response at the time, other than an answer referring interested readers to earlier mentions in <em>Notes &amp; Queries</em>, until the issue of February 8th, 1896, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1896-02-08_9_215/page/108/mode/2up?q=sin+eater">Vol 9 Iss 215 ; 8th. S. ix, p109-111</a>.</p>
<p>However, several other replies appear to have been languishing in the in-tray for some time, the most comprehensive of which was penned by a familiar name, Mr. J. P. Owen. A postscript to the answer notes that the letter had been <em>“sent for publication to ‘N. &amp; Q.’ before the appearance of Mr. Sidney Hartland’s first letter in the Academy (Nov., 1895), and that that gentleman had it before him, in the form of a letter from me to Prof. Rhys, in October, 1895.”</em>. Hartland had also referred to it in his <a class="reference internal" href="_second_controversy_pt_ii.html#secondcontrov-hartland-2ndletter"><span class="std std-ref">second letter</span></a> to the <em>Academy</em>.</p>
<blockquote id="nandq-owen-oct95-letter">
<div><p>SIN-EATER.</p>
<p>(8th S. viii. 288, 332.)</p>
<p>There appeared in the <em>Times</em> of 18 Sept., 1895, a very interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of Oswestry, on the above subject. Armed with that letter, I spent half a day at the British Museum, and looked through everything that Mr. Thomas refers to as bearing on the matter. I was already familiar with Joseph Downes’s tale in the ‘Mountain Decameron,’ but as I am no folklorist, that was about the extent of my own knowledge. It seems that the “authorities” for the alleged custom are (1) Aubrey ; (2) Mr. Matthew Moggridge, of Swansea ; and (3) Pennant.</p>
<p>The important statement as affecting South Wales is Mr. Moggridge’s, made at the sixth meeting of the Cambrian Archeological Society at Ludlow on 28 August, 1852.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>An extract is then provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After describing the custom Mr. Moggridge said that—</p>
<p>“in Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, there was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the practice was said to have pre-vailed to a recent period…… He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred a few yeara ago, but he believed it was extinct now.”</p>
<p>Mr. E. A. Freeman inquired whether “sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed?” Mr. Moggridge “answered in the affirmative.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The correspondent notes, as did Owen, that this was accepted apparently without further comment.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>That statement seems to have passed unchallenged, although there were Welshmen actually present—the late Mr. Wynne, of Peniarth, for instance, and the present Bishop of St. David’s.</p>
<p>It is greatly to Freeman’s credit that his scent for “facts” was keener than the Welshmen’s, even on their own ground. “Sin-eater” has never been adopted into the Welsh language, nor is there an equivalent term known in that language. And yet Mr. Moggridge must have had some ground for his assertion. On the supposition that he was acquainted with the Rev. John Williams, who was vicar of Llandebie and Bettws from 1804 to 1850, I think I can give a possible explanation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The correspondent then refers to the <em>Drych</em> and quotes the section we <a class="reference internal" href="_second_controversy_pt_i.html#drych-y-cymro-diodles"><span class="std std-ref">might recall</span></a> from its appeaarance in <em>Y Cymro</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When, after Williams’s death in 1850, there was a sale of his effects at the vicarage, my father bought a large quantity of Welsh periodicals and books. Among these was <em>Drych yr Amseroedd</em> (<em>Mirror of the Times</em>), by the Rev. Robert Jones, of Rhoslan, Carnarvonshire. That little work was a great favourite of mine when I was a boy. Let me translate a short passage :—</p>
<p>“<em>Inquirer</em>: I remember my grandfather mentioning something called Diodlas or Diodles. Can you tell me what that was?</p>
<p>“<em>Observer</em>: When some one happened to die in a household, some poor person chosen by the family would be the recipient of that precious (lit. happy) dole the Diodles. The manner of bestowing it was as follows: the family would send a cup to the coffin-maker, to be painted of the same colour as the coffin (two colours were used in those times—black for married folk, white for the single); and when the day of the funeral arrived, after the body had been placed on the bier, the head of the family gave the alms to the poor person selected, that is to say, a big loaf of good bread, and a large chunk of cheese with a piece of silver stuck in it, and the painted cup full of ale (if ale there happened to be), otherwisr of milk, presenting them across the corpse to the poor person. The latter would utter devout and fervent blessings and prayers for (lit. along with) the soul of the dead. It was customary for the entire household, on the first Sunday after the funeral, to go and kneel on the grave, each saying the Lord’s Prayer (Pader). And they would never mention any deceased member or relation of the family without saying very devoutly ‘Heaven be his portion’ (<em>Nefoedd iddo!</em>),”— p43.</p>

<p>The resemblance to Pennant, but with the addition of the Welsh term, is noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This custom will be familiar to the reader already, no doubt, from Pennant’s ‘Tour’ (ii. p. 338, London, 1784) ; but the Welsh name, and several graphic touches besides, are not to be found in Pennant’s description, which, by the way, is evidently derived from the same source as the account in the British Magazine for 1835 (vol. vii. p. 399), said there to be taken “from a MS. book of a bishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>We note also the manuscript <a class="reference internal" href="_through_1880s.html#archc-manuscript"><span class="std std-ref">republished</span></a> in Archaeologia Cambrensis.</em></p>
<p>The correspondent then delves further into the etymology of possibly related terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I venture to suggest that it is this by no means repulsive old North Walian custom that has given rise to the myth of the sin-eater. The only Welsh terms for the alleged custom that Mr. Moggridge could possibly have heard are <em>diodles</em> and <em>cwpan y meirw</em> —both of them unknown in South Wales.</p>
<p>Owen Pughe’s ‘Welsh Dictionary’ (Gee, 1832) has, under <em>Diawdlesir</em> :—</p>
<p>“A drinking cup; also a cup-full of drink, so called superstitiously, given for the dead, which in some places is called <em>diawdlyst</em>, and <em>cwpan y meire</em> (i.e., the cup of the dead).</p>
<p>“<em>Diawdlyst</em>=the give-ale.”</p>
<p>Canon Silvan Evans’s great ‘Welsh Dictionary,’ now in course of publication, has not yet, I believe, reached D. It does not mention <em>cwpan y meirw</em>.</p>
<p>I was very well acquainted, when a boy, with a small farmer from what I must call the “incriminated district,” who used to be in great request as a <em>post mortem</em> barber. He would most certainly have informed me of such a practice had it ever existed within his personal or traditional knowledge.</p>
<p>I may add that the opening of the “lawless” valley mentioned lies between the two parishes of Liandebie and Bettws, and that Swansea is only some ten or twelve miles off. It is not only possible, but highly probable that the aged vicar of those two parishes had often dwelt on the “Popish” superstition described so graphically in Jones of Rhoslan’s little book.</p>
<p>At any rate, that is the only explanation I can suggest of the Cambrian Archaeologists’ amusing “comedy of errors.” Mr, Sidney Hartland must search somewhere else than in Lilandebie and Cwmamman for evidence in support of his “cannibal” theory. J. P. Owen.</p>

<p>P.S.—Perhaps I may be allowed to add that the above was sent for publication to ‘N. &amp; Q.’ before the appearance of Mr. Sidney Hartland’s first letter in the Academy (Nov., 1895), and that that gentleman had it before him, in the form of a letter from me to Prof. Rhys, in October, 1895.</p>

<p>Several other answers also appeared in the same issue of <em>Notes &amp; Queries</em>. The first makes a general comment regarding the supposed transferrance of various personal charactersistics from the deceased following their death:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The two customs mentioned under the above heading are, in reality, quite reconcilable. According to a widely disseminated folk-belief, when a man dies his essential principles, moral or otherwise, may be taken over by some one else, the matter being managed in various ways in different parts of the world. Thus, among certain savage peoples a successful warrior banquets on the body of the enemy he has killed, in order to absorb his bravery and his other enviable characteristics. It is said that in ancient Mexico the captor was under obligation to offer up his captive at one of the solemn sacrificial feasts— an important reason for the custom being, probably, that the prisoner’s virtues as a man should be transmitted to the conqueror, though, from another point of view, no doubt the unfortunate sufferer was an earthly representative of the god to whom he was sacrificed.</p>
<p>In most cases where transference of moral or vital powers is supposed to take place, the recipient is thought to benefit ; but this is not a necessary part of the belief. He may occupy the place of a scapegoat, as does the Welsh sin-eater, and take upon himself all responsibility for the misdeeds of the deceased, although he more usually appropriates the good qualities of the dead. The idea of freeing the defunct from his imperfections can scarcely be so ancient as the more selfish notion of seizing his virtues. It would seem to be an outgrowth from the more egotistical belief, aided to some degree in development by the influence of religious or quasi-religious environment.</p>

<div><p>The ceremony of sin-eating as it was formerly practised in Scotland is described at p. 60 of Mr. Phiselton Dyer’s ‘Domestic Folk-lore.’ If my memory serves me, there is a good deal of information on this subject in ‘The Golden Bough,’ by Mr. Frazer.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Mr. Elton, in ‘Origins of English History,’ 1882, pp. 181, 182, has some interesting observations on sin-eating. He says, “The superstition certainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may be doubful whether it extended to the neighbouring parts of Wales.” He quotes Aubrey’s ‘Remains of Gentilisme’ (as every one writing on the subject does), and refers also to Sikes’s ‘British Goblins,’ 325, and Hone’s ‘Year Book,’ 858. A quotation from Mr. Wirt Sikes shows that the custom prevails in Turkestan. I doubt if the custom survives anywhere in Great Britain or Ireland.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Sin-eating pure and simple has, I think, been obsolete in these islands now for some considerable period. An excellent article dealing with the whole matter appears in Folk-Lore, 1892, pp. 144-157, by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. He states, at p. 156, that the custom (of sin-eating in one form or another) was existent, or quite recently existed, among the Greeks and Scots, and possibly among the Dyaks and Gipsies. He quotes the incident which occurred in 1851 or 1852, when the custom was still prevalent in Wales, and gives a reference to the <em>Archaeologia Cambrensis</em>, N.S., iii. (1852), 330. A curious variant of the custom is mentioned as surviving in Shropshire in 1892 (<em>Folk-Lore</em>, iv. pp. 392, 393).</p>
