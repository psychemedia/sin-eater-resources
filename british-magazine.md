ANCIENT USAGES AND CUSTOMS IN NORTH WALES. 
( Froma MS, book of a Bp.of St. Asaph, written about a century ago. ) 


In the church there is a general spitting; they usually spit at the 
name of the devil or any of his synonyma, and smite their breasts ‘at 
the name of Judas. In their ordinary conversation éhaé name gives 
them no salivation, but is too familiar in their mouths. 

If there be a fynnon vair (well of our lady or other saint in the 
parish) the water for baptism in the font is fetched thence. Old women 
are very fond of washing their eyes with the water after baptism. 

At the delivery of the bread and wine at the sacrament, several, 
before they receive the bread or cup, though held out to them, will 
flourish a little with their thumb to their faces, something like making 
the figure of across. They (the women mostly), say their prayers on 
their first coming to church, 

The Sunday after a marriage they come to church with their friends 
and relations with splendid appearance, disturbing the church, and 
striving who shall place the groom and bride in the most honourable 
seat. After church is over, with the fidlers before them, they run to 
all the ale-houses in the town. 

When they bless another, they are very apt to add to the blessing of 
God, the blessing of White Mary. 

The night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neigh- 
bours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, each 
ing with him some small present of meat, bread, or drink, (if the 
family be something poor,) but more especially candles, whatever the 
family is; and this night is called wl nos, whereby the coun corer 
seem to mean a at night. Their going to such @ they 
say is i wilio corph, i.e., to watch the corpse; but wélo signifies to

Hy by some still are given on these occasions,) are 

sant sea haa th to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house 
of the..dead before the.corpse is brought out. When the corpse. is 
brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, and covered before 
it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, 
daughter, or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives cross over the 
corpse to one of the poorest neighbours two or three white loaves) of 
bread.and.a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new 
wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor body that re- 
ceives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the 
minister (if present) saith the Lord’s prayer, and then they set forward 
towards church. And all along, from the house to the church-yard, 
at every cross way, the bier is laid down, and the Lord’s prayer re- 
newed ; and so when they come first into the church-yard, and before 
any of the verses appointed in the service to be said. 

n’some places there is a custom of ringing a little bell before the 
corpse from the house to the church-yard. If it should happen. to 
rain while the corpse is carried to church, ’tis reckoned to bode well 
for the deceased, whose bier is wet with the dew of heaven. Whena 
corpse is carried to church from any part of the town the bearers 
take care to carry it so that the cross may be on their right hand, nor 
will they bring the corpse to the church-yard any other way but 
through the south gate. There is also a custom of singing psalms on 
the way as the corpse is carried to church. 

At church nothing is done but as directed by the rubric, besides 
that, evening service is read with the office of burial. At those words, 
“we commit this body to the ground,” the minister holds the spade 
and throws in the earth first. 

The minister goes to the altar and there saith the Lord’s prayer, 
with one-of:the prayers appointed to be read at the grave; after 
which, the congregation offer upon the altar, or on a little board for 
that purpose fixed to the rails of the altar, their benevolence to the 
officiating minister. A friend of the deceased is appointed to stand at 
the altar, observing who gives, and how much. When all] have given,

the fire is almost quite extinguished every one throweth a white stone

Upon Christmas day in the morning, about three of the clock, most 
of the parishioners meet in the church, and, after prayers and a sermon, 
they continue there singing psalms and Welsh hymns with great devo.

infirmity are disabled coming to church, they never fail to have prayers 
and carols on our Saviour’s nativity at home.
