WAS the ancient custom of Sin-eating ever pre- valent in Wales ? The Sin-eater was one who ate the sins of a dead man, and so delivered his soul from purgatory. The practice seems to have varied in its details. Mr. Matthew Mogg- lidgc, in 1852, described to the Cambrian Archaeological Society what he alleged to be done within the memory of people then living in the neighbourhood of Llandebie, in Carmarthenshire. The Sin-eater, he says, placed a quantity of salt on the bosom of the dead man, and a small piece of bread on the salt. Then, with loud lamentations, lie ate the piece of bread, and so took into himself, as it were, all the sins of the deceased. The sum of half-a-crown was given him by the mourning relatives, and he ran away as soon as he could out of sight, for he was hated by all, and looked upon as a lost man. Is Moggridge's story to be relied upon ? At the recent meetings of the British Association it was recounted by Mr. Sidney Hartland, who based upon it his statement as to the prevalence of the custom in parts of Wales within the present cen- tury. The Cymro, in an erudite and interesting article on the question, adduces some facts to show that Moggridge was wrong. There was published in Carmarthen, some dozen miles from Llandebie, in the year 1823, a book containing a collection of Welsh superstitions. This book, called Hynafion Cymreig," has not a word about Sin-eating. Had the custom, as Moggridge alleged, been in existence it would certainly have been mentioned in the Hynafion." It is almost impossible to escape the conclusion that Moggridge was misinformed, and that Hartland's theory therefore falls to the ground. Then we have this further fact the custom is not mentioned in any Welsh literature that is extant. The poets do not refer to it, nor is there a syllable about it in any text-book of antiquities or collections of superstitions and folk-lore. This unbroken silence can only be explained by the absence of the practice in the country.

(Immediately follows related previous item in the same column)

Miss Fiona Macleod's new book, The Sin-eater, published this week, doubtless contains curious and interesting facts about this practice in the Celtic portions of northern Scotland. At any rate, her former books, "The Mountain Lovers and Pharais," deal with cognate subjects, and throw much valuable light on the daily life, character- istics, and superstitions of our kinsmen, the Gaels of the Scotch Highlands.

BY THE WAY.
...
The controversy about the Sin-eater in Wales is still going on merrily in the columns of the Academy. In tho last number Mr. Hartland, metaphorically speaking, pulls Mr. J. P. Owen to .pieces.
