Preface

...

There is in fact, and literally, no Reading Public in Wales, but the better educated part of the more secluded Welsh peasantry. The gentry of Wales dispute this, but they had better disprove it. Let them do so by attaching some importance to so invaluable a resource, one so innocent, so exalting, so vital to good morals as reading. Vermin hunting might stiU be the grand resource. Facts are stubborn things. Seventeen Welsh periodicals circulate well among the humbler classes ! One, conducted with ability — and with great sacrifice by the spirited patrons of it, to the honour of their country — one acknowledged as worthy of support, by high critical authorities not Welsh — has at last ceased to circulate for want of that support from the gentry. Other orders, seventeen — the gentry not one : verbum sat. ...

Finally, in extenuation of what will perhaps be deemed presumptuous ambition thus announced, the writer begs it may be remembered, that he is pleading for no novelty in composition, which he conceits himself the inventor of, but merely a bona fide return to th?it honest, hear tfelty fearless tone of expression, which distinguished our glorious old dramatists — for a little indulgence to those flowers, even in prose, which Jeremy Taylor did not deem unworthy of even divinity, nor 18 THE MOUNTAIN-DECAMERON. Bacon disdain to strew, even copiously, over philosophy's rugged path. ... Resigning the auctorial pompous periphrasis of the third person I shall entreat, '"beloved reader," your indulgence for much quaintness, perhaps obscurity, certainly much ignorance of the outer world at least, which I feel assured that you will discover in these pages. Doubtless, if I be as ignorant of the heart and human character, as I am of the world and the worldly character, my authorship will be a woful failure. Something, I hope, is to be allowed for the self-delusions of an almost Hteral hermit. Shut up or wandering among mountains for these PREFACE. 19 many years past, conversing with few but the rudest people, I have not the advantage of literary or other refined society, to freshen my stagnating thoughts, or correct my erroneous ones ; to tell me where those thoughts are not duly elicited, or where it were more graceful to suppress them. I am my own adviser and my own critic, my own '' pensive public," and hence, perhaps, ought to be less-severely quizzed if I become, as in the previous lines — my " own trumpeter.'^ Nor do mountains alone constitute my solitude, but the misfortune of antedating old age by the loss of friends. The splendid streets of your huge metropolis, with their immense throngs of people, are to some' few bosom-aliens among them, more deeply solitary than mountain-avenues, with their multitude of trees and moving flocks. For myself, I can say that the mighty " hum '^ of those crowds no more disturbs me, who neither share in the chase of their many interests nor swell the cry, than does the constant roar of the cataracts of my home country. Nor do I state this without a latent conceit that possibly such a recluse, addressing such an audience as the " Reading Public/^ may be regarded as a curious kind of monster. In such solitude, it is natural for the unguided mind (especially if in 20 THE MOUNTAIN-DECAMERON. old time enthusiastic) both to hope and despond to excess. I have however reached that stage of '^ Ufe's poor play '^ when a writer (and still more if he be a parent) has a darker fear than that of the critic "before his eyes^' — Death. ...



Now, as to the travelling part of my Diary, distinct from the story-telling — I can truly assure thee that there is matter in abundance for rational curiosity, left in Wales, and, what is better, strong vestiges of what we may surely characterise as patriarchal life, if life as rudely simple, yet happy, as that recorded of very early times may be so designated. The se- cluded Welsh breeder of sheep and tender of cattle, leads a life of solitary wildness truly cu- rious to the curious in man^s nature — one of pastoral peace, if not pastoral vagrancy, that leaves little to the imagination to fill up for that of an ancient man of woolly wealth, or a modern one among the Bedouin Arabs. When you read of the picture of primitive modes of even Cambrian life being now wholly lost, of MacAdam and the schoolmaster having swept both Ignorance and Pastoral in their pri- 30 THE MOUNTAIN-DECAMERON. mitive character out of Britain^ you may, I am very sorry and happy to say^ suspend your belief. Tourists — bookmakers I mean^ — follow the routes of predecessors^ and see with their eyes, and nothing beyond ; thence I believe it is that so little is known of the domestic lives and characters of the direct descendants of the Britons, our fellow countrymen. ...

PREFACE. 33 Such then being the kind of entertainment which for ten days T propose to provide for thee, I shall first ask, Art thou willing to take a cup of tea and a tale with us under some ^^ ro- mantic mountain forest-crowned '' ? To sit at our tent's mouth on some sunshiny sod, be- twixt a hanging wood and water, " far from the haunts of men " (yet peradventure busier with man than ever), sung to by the woodlark or cuckoo, or plained to by the owl, possibly ? for our odd amateur-gypsy the Doctor, is fond of reading on into the night, by a very bright moon, or his little lamp when the night is sultry and still. If possible I will make you our guest, without endangering you by night air, or bivouac, or dewy greensward, by remitting you the very feeling of the hour, at the hour, by putting forth my writing tools, even by that lamp if day's be "burned out/' (My own health has vastly improved under this novel regimen.) Although weeks or months may elapse before you receive these my dispatches, " written on the field " — of flowers, not of blood — still I pre- fer penning them on the spur of the occasion — (the spur of the scenic and pictorial beauty of landscape) to writing from mere cold recollec- tion when the glow of the moment is gone for ever.

...


Owing to this mode of life, he has acquired the habits of the mountaineers, men who hav- ing nothing to cloak, and no part to act, throw themselves open to a stranger at once, and expect the same from him. Hence he often startles a worldly man by questions such as children only ask, but men in a less artificial state of society might rationally ask also. '^ How old are you, sir?" or, "Did you retire from the world for pleasure; or from disap- pointment, embarrassment, or" — These may serve to exemplify this species of oddity in him.

The Mountain Decameron
by Downes, Joseph
1836 Volume III
p 232-6

But a yet further introduction is needful, (ere entering on their story,) touching a curious superstitious practice not very long obsolete in Wales.

THE MOUNTAIN-DECAMERON

THE LAST "SIN-EATER" OF WALES.

So late as the earlier part of the last century that strange character of a stranger superstition, known by the name of "The Sin-Eater" was not unknown in Wales. This was some desperate being, who, (unless we suppose him an unbeliever) being past redemption, lost to all hope of salvation, did for a slight reward, or to gratify the relatives of one lying dead, take on his own soul all the sins of the deceased by a formal act, sometimes receiving confessions during life, and bargaining for the burthens thus to be imposed on his already laden soul.

Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom, (but I have an idea by Mr. Kyrle, the "Man of Ross,") which describes a "Sin-Eater," who "lived by Ross highway," and is described as a "gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor rascal."

If we consider these persons as probably not less believers than those who employed them, it is not easy to imagine a condition of the mind more terrific, desolate, and desperate,
than theirs; thus more and more removed from the hope of mercy with every death, and assurance of perdition doubly sure.

A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete, gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last "Sin-Eater of Wales."

"I got lost," says he, "near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey, on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was to gain that between Penyboat village and Machyulleth town. I was cautioned to ride far round this pitchy morass, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits — the whole being a quaking morass. In truth its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse. It forms a great brown-black triangle of land, without a tree, or any vegetation but patches of gorse. Yet the piles of *mawn* (all fetched away by persons on foot) diversified the dismalness with a sort of low walls, and between was gleaming of some water, from the many holes whence it is dug. Till the moon went down, which lit me a space. I could just distinguish these dismal pools and cuts like canals, by its glimmer. I never saw ought so dismal in my own country as this great turbary of hollow ground looked, a huge green-roofed pit, the pitchy mud thus betraying itself every where, as the large moon, looking red as blood in a foul fog stagnating all over it, took leave of it, and its brown grew browner, and that browner black, till the last to be seen was one horrid blackness, where nothing lived, and nothing was heard but the low roar of the sea washing it on two sides, like the hum of some great city. That deepvoiced murmur of the sea so sounding like a thousand voices, made it more shocking to look upon, the space between, as dumb as a great grave. More than once I thought a light glimmered in the very midst, but I took it for the Jack-a-lantern, if not something worse, for I had heard of Wreckers, and there had been a shipwreck, the weather wild, and even the day had been hardly light.

"At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse's hoof, and I saw a pleasant cottage taper instead of that will-o'-wisp of the black bog, which was as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, the corpse-candle, carried by a figure of one (as these Welsh say) whose own burial will soon take place, in the spot it vanishes at. The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground. Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread, placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office — that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man's on his own, after making a sign of the Cross, and then praying for a transfer of whatever pains or penances in fire or "thick-ribbed ice," or molten lead, or what beside monastic belief attached to the perdition of tormented souls, from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and for ever."

This is the traveller's account of this incident.

He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled on the high road's point, the straw of her husband's late bed — the usual signal of a death in the house.

The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck, and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dared by night; whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse. One curious belief was current, that he was no other than "The Wandering Jew" — the man who spit on his Saviour, and cannot die — that fable familiar to so many countries.

Now as this traveller and the wretched being he stood in the dark and wind expecting, will be hereafter returned to, to avoid double description, this sketch may conclude, whose only purpose was to explain the character of a Sin-Eater of Wales, and the habits of one.
