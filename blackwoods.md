We have heard it asserted that
the premonitory token of a death, known as
corpse - candles," is
known only to the diocese of St David's
But in the interest-ing publication 'Bygones' already
alluded to [Bygones, 1871-3, p. 36. The account has been somewhat shortened and altered
qua language, to suit the limits of our article.]  we find a remarkable
 account of their incidence at Crig-ion, in the county of Montgo-
mery and diocese of Hereford, and
we have little doubt that the super-
stition has small regard for distinc-tions of North and South Wales.
The statement of an old inhabitant
 will explain its nature and pecu-
  liarities. “During a heavy snow,
  when he was a boy, his mother, as
  she went up-stairs to bed, pointed
   out to him a light proceeding slowly
   from a neighbouring farm-house to-
    wards the church. A servant com-
     ing up-stairs at the time was also
      witness to it. The light traversed a
       line where there was no road or gate
       into the churchyard, and in a mo-
     ment or two all the windows of the
     Church were lighted up, and then
     gradually the light went back by
      the course it had come, and van-
       ished at the farm-house. Its ten-
        ant, they knew, was unwell, but, as
        the snow was so deep, it was not till
         the second day that they heard he

had died at the very time they saw
the light. The snow continued,
and the roads became more and
more blocked up, so that, on the
day of the funeral, it was found im 
possible to take the procession by
the usual route, and a portion of 
the church-wall had to be taken 
down, to admit the entrance of the
bier. That portion of the wall was
the exact spot which the deponent
saw the light cross on the evening
of the death." [According to Borrow, Wild Wales, vol. iii. p. 223, these corpse-candles are dan-
gerous to those who casually meet them. Men die from contact with them, then
the candle is abroad on another errand,] Of all the many
death-tokens we are acquainted with
—such as the “hooting of owls,” 
“the solitary crow at the tree," “ the
howling of dogs," “the crowing 
hen," the sudden stopping of the 
family clock-none is so weird and
impressive as this of the corpse-
candles, none less soluble by na 
tural causes, or even by the freaks
of human credulity. Among death- 
bed customs prevalent in the Prin- 
cipality, it is not easy to explain
that which removes from under
the dying head a pillow that has
pigeon's feathers in it; nor is it by 
any means a sufficient reason for 
the custom, widely prevalent, of 
placing a deep pewter plate filled 
with salt upon the chest of the 
corpse immediately after “laying
out," that it is done to prevent the
body swelling. Salt is rather, as is 
explained by the learned and curious 
Brand, the emblem of eternity and
immortality, and as such a sort of 
“satan-fuge,” for “the devil loveth 
no salt in his meat," and the righte-
ous are “the salt of the earth.” 
As Herrick writes-
“The body's salt the soul is, which, when 
gone, The flesh soone sucks in putrefaction.”
It is a darker and narrower super- 
stitution, still surviving in North 
and South Wales, and the Border,

which at a funeral hands over to a
 hireling, who lives by such ser-
 vices, a loaf of bread, a maple bowl
 full of beer or milk, and a sixpence,
in consideration of which he takes
 upon him all the sins of the de-
funct, and frees him or her from
walking after death. It is hard to
 say which is most degraded, the
 employers or the employed, in such
 a transaction. The scapegoat in
 this case is currently called a "Sin-
 eater." Of such it would be no
 stretch of imagination to believe
that, like Sion-y-Cint, the Welsh
 Faust, they had sold themselves to
the devil. Amidst odd grave-
yard etiquette, we may notice that
 in some parishes of Montgomery-
 shire it is all-important to rest the
corpse under the shade of the moun-
 tain-ash, whose magical virtue lies in
the belief that it was the wood of
the Saviour's Cross. More common
 is the usage of mourners and others
 who attend a Welsh funeral, carry-
 ing a sprig of rosemary and drop-
ping it into the grave with the last
words of the service. These floral
rites are very pretty, and we hope
not soon likely to die out. Who
that has any acquaintance with
 Monmouthshire can easily forget
 Flowering Sunday? Or who would
wish to see discontinued the linger-
ing Shropshire custom of hanging
 garlands in the churches at the
death of a maiden? Our notice of
superstitions in the nature
 must be confined to two, which are
commemorated in the folk-lore of
Llansantfraed-yn-Mechain, in Mont-
gomeryshire—the ordeal of the key,

and the ordeal of the sieve. The
 methodus of the former was on
this wise : If an Achan was to be
detected, the family gathered in a
 semicircle round its head, with the
