# Initial Observations

As eight o’clock struck on the evening of Monday, August 23rd, 1852, in the New Buildings at Ludlow, the Vice President of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., M.P., called the sixth annual meeting of that learned association to order.

On behalf of the absent President, the Right. Hon. the Earl Cawdor, the Vice-President resigned the chair to the President elect, the Hon. R. H. Clive, M.P., who then presented his inaugural address.

The meeting as a whole was programmed through to Saturday morning, with daily excursions and meetings each evening. (The short excursion on Wednesday also allowed for a "morning" meeting starting at one o'clock that afternoon which included a paper "On the Deposit of Gold and Silver Coins in Wales" by Edward Rogers, Esq., Vice- President, who read a paper, followed by a short paper on Ludlow Church by R. Kyrke Penson, Esq.. The scene duly set, *"[t]he Society proceeded to the Church, where the principal architectural details were pointed out by Mr. Penson. They afterwards proceeded to the Castle, and spent some time in the examination of the magnificent ruins."*

On the penultimate day of the meeting, the members gathered at the Feathers Inn at half-past nine in the morning for the Friday excursion. *The half-timbered building, a 17th century coaching inn, remains there still, with its original studded plank front door and bay windows moulded with curved mullions and transoms and cast diamond glazing. A [class 1 listed building [1282026]](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1282026?section=official-listing), it is now known as the [The Feathers Hotel](https://www.feathersatludlow.co.uk/) and looks well worth a visit.*

```

Their first stop was the Priory Church at Leominster, whence they arrived shortly after eleven o'clock. This is well over a 10 mile trip, so they must have had transport of some sort.

According to the [Hereford Journal of Wednesday, September 1st, 1852](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000398/18520901/013/0002), after Leominster, Kingsland and Aymestrey Churches were next visited, and from thence the party proceeded to Wigmore Castle and Church, which excited no little admiration. The excursionists then resumed their seats, and returned to Ludlow, via Aston Church, where the Rev. J. Burleigh James, the respected local secretary, directed attention to the tympanum in the Norman arch.  The whole circular trip covered a 30 mile journey or so.

The evening programme that day convened at half-past seven o'clock, with the President, the Hon R. H. Clive, M.P., in the chair. It commenced with the reading of a paper on the *History of the Parish of Carno, Montgomeryshire* by T. O. Morgan, Esq., of Aberystwyth. Following a vote of thanks to Mr. Morgan, "enthusiastically accorded by the meeting", and a short discussion on *Municipal records of Ludlow*," Matthew Moggridge, Esq. then proceeded to make some observations the "Custom of the Sin Eater in Cwm Ammon Valley".

```{admonition} Cwm Ammon
:class: tip
Literally, "Amman valley", in Carmarthenshire, about 12 miles north of Swansea, at the foot of the Black Mountain, the western most peak of the Brecon Beacons.
```

The [Shrewsbury Chronicle of Friday 03 September 1852](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000401/18520903/060/0005) reported Mr. Moggridge's oration as follows:

> The custom was this— formerly, when a party died in the district named, a person known by the name of the "Sin-eater” was called in, who placed upon the corpse a plate, with salt in it, and some bread over the salt; the "Sin-eater" then eat the bread, and was believed, by so doing, to have taken to himself all the sins of the deceased, and for which act he received fee of two shillings and sixpence. When he had accomplished his task he hurried off as fast as he could. The "sin-eater" was regarded as a man totally and irretrievably lost.

This, then, is one view of the tradition. It shares several of the elements of the tale told by Ceri Phillips: the location is the same (the foot of the Black Mountain, just north of Swansea); the period of the story is around the time of the Cambrian Archaeological Association meeting, befitting the end of the tradition. The ritual is similar, although the detail differs: no mention of any beer in Moggridge's account, and with the soup replaced by bread and salt. And whilst there is no mention of a fee in Phillips' scene setting, that the sin-eater was paid is evident in the story he went on to tell.

As our journey continues, we will see how some more of the detail included in Phillips' tale does start appear in the folkloric research record, demonstrating not least how the art of the storyteller can weave in elements that make the story a more evocative one.

But for now, let us continue to hear what Mr. Moggridge Esq. has to say, at least according to the Shrewsbury Chronicle:

> He had the authority of a clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy [*Shropshire*] for stating that portion of this custom had prevailed in that district until within very recent years. It did not go to the lamentable length practised Cwm Ammon, but merely comprised the plate and the salt. The custom prevailed not long ago Oxfordshire, and in Cwm Ammon it had existed until very lately. He found that about twenty years ago the plate, the salt, and the bread, were placed upon the dead at the latter place, but the "sin-eater" was not sent for ; and as they advanced towards Swansea the "sin-eater" and the bread were dispensed with, and the plate and salt only remained.

It is not clear who the "clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy" was, but it does suggest that the tradition also existed in Shropshire. And as we shall in the later controversies, such eyewitness evidence, if such it was, may well have proved invaluable in helping settle debates about the existence of the sin-eater in that area.

```{admonition} A Tale of Stanton Lacy
:class: seealso
Whilst we do not know what stories the "clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy" might have told, a tale of another clergyman of Stanton Lacy is recorded.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Foulkes
```

Another clergyman, also unnamed, appears to offer evidence of a related ritual a little further to the south, and still in current practice:

> In Monmouthshire they had not only the plate and the salt, but also introduced the singular practice of making the figure of cross in the salt; and they frequently cut an onion or apple into four quarters, and placed one quarter each comer of the cross. He had recently received letter from a clergyman who resided in the neighbourhood, in which it was stated that the custom existed in that form even to the present day. He thought he had established the fact of this horrible custom having been in operation in this island, and they ought to thankful it was not now, for if there was one thing more disgusting than another it was this custom.

So now as well as the ingredients, we have a ritual action. And more varied foodstuffs, although the contrasting of the *onion or apple* does seem rather unusual. As to what else the recent correspondence may have revealed, we have no idea.

According to Moggridge, then, whilst the sin-eating practice was perhaps no longer taking place, he seems to claim that there is no doubt that it had once occurred, but that only vestiges of the ritual still now remained in the 1850s.

There then seems to have followed some discussion of the subject, as appears to be the norm from the other meetings and presented papers:

> Thomas Allen, Esq. observed, that in reference to this custom he was able bear witness of it another county (Pembroke), at which their association met last year. When a poor person died, a plate with a heap of salt on it was placed on the body, and in the salt was stuck a lighted candle. He should like to ask Mr. Moggridge if there was any necessary connection between the custom he (Mr. Moggridge) had mentioned and the one just named by himself.

The role of the candle in Welsh funeral customs is now introduced as a perhaps part of a separate ritual. It is something we will surely further encounter, later in the tale...

The report then continues to elaborate on Mr. Allen's (we presume) comments:

> He could not exactly see it, but he did not deny it. Some persons might think it was rather Romish in its nature. He really did not quite see that there was any necessary connection between this custom and the introduction of the "sin-eater." It was quite clear in the instances mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, that he had shown only a very slight connection between the two ; he did not feel sure to whether it was necessary to connect them. The popular notion in Pembrokeshire, with reference to the placing of salt on the bodies of the dead, was that it kept away the evil spirit. It was usual, after the candle had been lighted, for the friends of the deceased to watch through the night over the body, in order that they might, by their presence, keep off the evil spirit.

Here, Mr. Allen has introduced two further elements into the discussion. Firstly, the notion of watching over the body through the night; and secondly, the idea this might be some sort of "Romish" (which is to say, Roman Catholic) ritual.

He then returns to the possible role of the salt:

> As regarded the salt, he thought it might be explained in this way — as an emblem of purification ; it might that the salt was for purification, and the candle for keeping the evil spirits away. This really was a subject, if any person took delight it, on which further light might be thrown; for those meetings were not only for the purpose of stating what they knew, but also to provoke discussion. He did not mean to discuss the subject now, but at a future time.

Whether or not Mr. Allen *did* return at a later date to the purifying role of salt, I haven't (yet!) attempted to discover.

Another possible origin story for the role of the sin-eater is then introduced:

> Rev. I. Burleigh James.— I think the originator of the custom is the scapegoat.

As well as the pressing consideration of whether the tradition is still extant:

> Jelinger C. Symonds, Esq. would like to know whether or not this custom of sin-eating was extinct. If not, to send missionaries abroad would be a farce, while they had customs so disgusting at home.

As in many casual asides in the correspondence of he time, the missionary zeal, and colonial outlook, of many of the discussants, is plainly evident.

At this points, as befitted a society convened to study *archaeology*, and as such, relics of *the past*, the chairman felt the need to step in and remind the members of the historical focus of their discussions, whilst at the same time adding his own opinions as to *current* funeral customs into the debate:

> The President hoped they were not entering into the history of present customs, but into the history of past events. It struck him that even at the present day when that melancholy event took place, the death of an individual, there was always a certain respect paid to the corpse : it was not closed in the coffin, but was left for a certain time for the inspection of friends ; the room was hung, the candles were lighted, and there was always a person in the room who remained during the time that exhibition took place. It was out of respect to the deceased that much ceremony took place, he could not regard it in any other light. It had been continued from time immemorial, and with every degree of respect he should entertain towards that custom there was nothing in it that he could exclaim against.

Mr. Symons, Esq., reassured the President as the focus of his attention, whilst also acknowledging the contemporary view of the President:

> JELINGER C. Symons, Esq.- -Of course my impression was as to the custom of the sin-eater. Some part the custom appears arise out of respect for the dead.

Mr Moggridge then tried to regain control of the discussion:

> Matthew Moggridge, Esq. said the Duke of Marlborough was the person he had alluded to. He sent for Dr. Bowles during his sickness, and when the Dr. arrived he found that the Duke was already dead, and the plate and the salt was placed on the body. Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished was to get at the truth.

From the context, we might assume that Dr Bowles was a medical man. As to the [*Duke of Marlborough*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Marlborough_(title)), George Spencer-Churchill, the 5th Duke of Marlborough, collector of antiquities and books, as well as peer and politician, is a possible candidate, dying on March 5th, 1840, at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.

Moggridge then attempted to address certain of the questions raised:

> He thought that the jist of what fell from his friend (Mr. Allen) was that there was no immediate and direct connection between the custom of the sin-eater and the plate and the salt.

(At this point in this particular telling, I can quite easily imagine Mr. Symons looking around to those sat beside him, spluttering silently to himself, and with his arms raised in despair, "but it was *you* who mentioned the salt in the first place!")

> Starting from the Cwm Amman Valley he found that the most horrible portion of the custom dropped, and the rest still remained; and as he advanced still further he found that less remained.

So for Moggridge, it is the *eating over the body* that is presumably at the heart of the tradition his is attempting to describe.

The next part of the report then reveals a gap in the earlier part of account in the Shrewsbury Chronicle:

> Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, told them that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire.

As we shall shortly see, "Aubrey", his reputation, and the account ascribed to him plays a foundational part in the folklore of the Welsh sin-eater, at least as far as the Victorian correspondents drew their evidence.

> Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire where he saw a man whom he described as the sin-eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found in the very district where Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection — that the more odious part of the custom has been removed, but the plate and the salt remained. He thought the plate and the salt was of eastern origin.

It is not clear what Moggridge's findings were. If they were the findings of the "clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy", that is in Shropshire (or *Salop*) rather than Herefordshire.

Mr. Moggridge's final comments addressed the question that was surely on everyone's mind:

> There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice now; one case occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct in the Cwm Amman Valley.

So then, apparently the practice was extinct, and had, to Mr Moggridge's knowledge at least, last been carried out around about 1845. However, it is not clear from this report at least where, or by what evidence, he might make this claim.

> E. A. Freeman, Esq. enquired whether sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed ?

Again, this question is one that we shall return to: if the tradition was a South Walian one, then might we not expect to find vestiges of it in the language (as well as the folklore) of the Principlaity?

> We understand Mr. Moggridge to reply in the affirmative.

So the phrase, at least in its English form, was claimed to be a recognised one.

> After some few observations from H. Hodges Hughes, Esq., and W. W. E Wynne Esq.

Whatever those observations were, they were seemingly not thought substantive enough to be reporteed by the Shrewsbury Chronicle.

> The President moved a vote of thanks to Mr Moggridge, which was warmly accorded by the meeting.

And so we have it, the first part of tale. But already there are some pieces missing from that report: who were Moggridge's clerical correspondents, what evidence did he have of sin-eating in the 1840s, and what was the account given by "Aubrey"?

To answer at least one of those questions, we need to look to another report of the meeting, this time on [Volume 3, Issue 12, page 332, of *Archaeologia Cambrensis*](https://archive.org/details/sim_archaeologia-cambrensis_1852-10_3_12/page/332/mode/2up), the Cambrian Archaeological Association, dated October, 1852).

## Other News Reports

As well as the Shrewsbury Chronicle, reports of the "The Cambrian Archaelogical Association at Ludlow" also appeared in the [Hereford Journal of Wednesday, September 1st, 1852](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000398/18520901/013/0002) and

The *Hereford Journal* description of the first part of Friday evening's meeting introduces the notion that the age of Christian enlightment was extinguishing the practise of sin-eating

> T. O. Morgan, Esq., of Aberystwith, read paper upon "The Parish of Carno, Montgomeryshire," which was followed by some remarks by the Rev. Basil Jones; after which W. Moggridge, Esq. delivered a very interesting discourse upon a custom which formerly existed in Wales, in connection with deceased persons, and which he had recently discovered was noticed in an old work, as being prevalent in the neighbourhood of Ross, in Herefordshire. The custom was this— when a party died, a person known by the name of "the sin-eater" was called in, who placed upon the corpse a platter containing a loaf of bread and some salt; the sin-eater afterwards ate the bread, and in doing so was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the deceased person. Happily, however, the light of a Christian age was rapidly banishing superstition from the minds of the people, and that custom had, he believed, now disappeared.
>
> Thomas Allen, Esq. stated that there still existed custom in Wales of placing candle in salt, and burning it in the chamber of a deceased person, and made some very interesting remarks upon it, as connected with the custom of the sin-eater.

The Hereford Times, in its [Saturday, September 4th, 1852](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000396/18520904/030/0007) edition only gave scant mention of the J. O. Morgan's paper on "The History of the Parish of Carno, Montogomeryshore", but described at length the discussion on "The Municipal Records of Ludlow", presumably based on local interest. For the most part, its report on the sin-eater discussion closely followed the one previously described:

> M. MOGGRIDGE Esq., made some remarks upon a singular custom which formerly existed in Wales, in connection with deceased persons, and which he had recently discovered was noticed in old work, as being prevalent in the neighbourhood of Ross, in Herefordshire. The custom was this—when party died, a person known by the name of "the sin-eater was called in, who placed upon the corpse a platter containing a loaf of bread and some salt; the sin-eater afterwards ate the bread, and in doing so was supposed to take upon himself the sins of the deceased person. Happily, however, the light of Christian age was rapidly banishing superstition from the minds of the people, and that custom had, he believed, now disappeared.
>
> Mr. Allen remarked that there still existed a cu»tom in Wales of placing a candle in salt, and burning it in the chamber of deceased person. Was this in any way connected with the custom just described? It was a popular notion that the candle stuck in salt would scare away the evil spirit, and it was usual for the friends of the deceased to watch the corpse for a certain period.
>
> The Rev. J. B. James reminded the meeting of the of this custom—the scape goat.
>
> Mr. Symons wished to understand distinctly whether this custom still prevailed, and if so, what extent. It was to be hoped that, for the credit of religion in this country, the custom was extinct. To send missionaries abroad to convert the heathen when a state of things disgusting and abhorrent existed at home, was perfect farce. The mere practice of putting salt on the bodies of corpses to prevent decomposition was a distinct custom, and totally irrelevant to the subject of this discussion.
> The President considered that the object of the inquiry was that we might understand the and practices of the past. When a corpse lay state, there was always person appointed to remain with it during that exhibition. He viewed that only a mark respect to the deceased. He apprehended that, so far as explanation could now be given, may some way have arisen from practice.
>
> Mr. Moggridge considered it to be an eastern custom, which he believed was now extinct. Mr. Freeman made some brief observations on the word "sin-eater" as used by Mr. Moggridge.

However, the report also includes the comments, not previously report, by Messrs. Hodges and Wynne:

> Mr. Hodges, of Ludlow, surgeon, said that it was a common practice to place a pewter filled with salt upon a corpse. Pewter was known good conductor of heat, and the salt had cooling effect.
>
> Mr. Wynne said believed it was used in Merionethshire to prevent decomposition of the body.

As we later try to ascertain the development, and provenance, of the development of the sin-eater history, this additional fragments may help us identify by what source various authors came to their conclusions.

## Tha Account According to *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, 1852

In many respects, the official record of the meeting in the journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association follows that of Shrewsbury Chronicle, down to an exact match in some of the phrases, although it must be said, with some occasional omission.

So let us retrace our steps, and see what the official record in the following month's [*Archaeologia Cambrensis*, October 1852, Vol 3, Issue 12, p330-332](https://archive.org/details/sim_archaeologia-cambrensis_1852-10_3_12/page/332/mode/2up) has to say on the matter and return to the start of the discussion. (We shall not tend use such an exhaustive approach *in general*, but it may well prove instructive in this case.) Mr. Morgan has been enthusiastically accorded a vote of thanks by the meeting for his paper on the *History of the Parish of Carno, Montgomeryshire*, there has been a short discussion on *Municipal records of Ludlow*, and Mr. Moggridge has taken the floor.

> Mr. Moggridge then proceeded to make some observations on the custom of the sin-eater and said,— The custom of employing the *sin-eater* probably obtained in ancient times throughout a large portion of Wales and its Marches. When a person died, the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate—thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done he received his fee of 2s. 6d., and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze; for, as it was believed that he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood— regarded as a mere Pariah— as one irremediably lost.

In many respects, this is the same as the report in the Shrewsbury Chronicle, but with two notable differences: first, the report of "the muttering of an incantation over the bread"; and second, the description of the sin-eater as "utterly detested in the neighbourhood— regarded as a mere Pariah— as one irremediably lost" rather than just as "a man totally and irretrievably lost".

Let's see what other points of difference we can find in the accounts...

> In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained.

Here we have mention of a particular place, *Llandebie*, midway between Dinefwr and Ystalyfera, as mentioned by Ceri Phillips in his story,

> Thus near Llanon `[there is a Llanon just down the coast from Aberystwyth]`, within twenty years, the plate, salt and bread were retained, —near Swansea (and indeed very generally) only the plate and salt. In a parish near Chepstow `[in the county of Monmouthshire, on the Welsh borders]` it was usual to make the figure of a cross on the salt, and cutting an apple or an orange into quarters, to put one piece at each termination of the lines.

Ah, this seems a little less unusual: *an apple or an orange*. Perhaps the Shrewsbury Chronicler misread their own handwriting? We might also note that there has also been no mention of a certain "clergyman residing at Stanton Lacy".

The "official" report then goes on to describe some of the other differences noted by Mr. Moggridge, including the evidence of the mysterious "Aubrey" mentioned, but not quoted, in the Shrewsbury Chronicle account:

> There were other slight variations in those parts of the custom still extant, as indeed variations existed in old times when it prevailed in all its profane absurdity, an instance of which might be found-in the adjoining county, as mentioned by Aubrey in the Lansdowne MSS. at the British Museum. (See *Hone’s Year Book*, p. 858.)

Here, then, we have a citation, of a sort, for Aubrey – in the Lansdowne manuscripts — and a reference to chase: *Hone’s Year Book, p.858.*

```{admonition} On the hunt...
:class: seealso
At this point, we must surely make a note to ourselves to try to track down *Hone’s Year Book* in general, and `page 858` of that tome in particular.
```

So how did Mr. Moggridge quote "Aubrey"?

> "In the county of Hereford," he says, "was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money ; in consideration whereof he took upon him *ipso facto* all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead."

Despite being only a short paragraph, this brings in much new evidence that is also often called upon in the later controversies. In the first case, we have the personage of an actual sin-eater descrbed as *"a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal"*. We also have an adddress, of sorts: *"a cottage on Rosse highway"*. The process of the ritual is described, along with some of the implements: *"a mazard bowl of maple"*, and a first mention of *beer*, which we recall from Phillips' story framing. The sin-eater's fee is also reduced, to *sixpence*. And finally, a rather strange line: that the sin eater's actions *freed him or her ["the defunct"] from __walking__ after they were dead*. Does this invoke some other belief, that after death souls "walk" the Earth, as ghosts perhaps? Or does it relate to some sort of purgatory? To understand this better, we perhaps need to know a little more about "Aubrey", and the times in which he was writing...

Some of Mr. Moggridge's observations upon this quotation then follow:

> Here the same end was sought to be attained by a slightly different form. The difference in the fee was somewhat striking, from whence it might be argued that a Caermarthenshire soul was worth five times as much as that of a Herefordshire man—unless indeed it was not rather to be accounted for by supposing that the stout Marcher had fewer sins to get rid of.

In respect of Mr. Allen's comments regarding salt, we get a difference in tone regarding the extent to which Mr. Allen and Mr. Moggridge may appear to have differed in emphasis or opinion. Specifically, the Chronicle reports that *'He [Mr. Allen] really did not quite see that there was any necessary connection between this custom and the introduction of the "sin-eater."  It was quite clear in the instances mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, that he had shown only a very slight connection between the two ; he did not feel sure to whether it was necessary to connect them.'* versus *'He could not exactly see, but did not deny it'* in the formal record.

> Mr. Allen observed that in reference to the custom of placing salt on a corpse he was able to bear testimony to its existence in another county (Pembroke), in which their Association met last year. When a poor person died, a plate with a heap of salt on it was placed on the body, and in the salt was stuck a lighted candle. He should like to ask Mr. Moggridge if there was any necessary connexion between the custom he had mentioned of the sin-eater, and the one just named by himself. He could not exactly see, but did not deny it. Some persons might think it was rather Romish in its nature. He did not see that there was any connexion between this custom and the introduction of the "sin-eater." The popular notion, in Pembrokeshire, with reference to the placing of salt on the bodies of the dead, was that it kept away the evil spirit. It was usual, after the candle had been lighted, for the friends of the deceased to watch through the night over the body, in order that they might, by their — keep off the evil spirit. As regarded the salt, he thought it might be explained in this way—as an emblem of purification; it might be that the salt was for purification, and the candle for keeping evil spirits away. This was a subject, if any person took delight in it, on which further light may be thrown; for those meetings were not only for the purpose of stating what they knew, but also to induce a search for further information.

In the closing line, we also note a difference in the texts: *but also to provoke discussion. He did not mean to discuss the subject now, but at a future time.* in the Chronicle vs *but also to induce a search for further information.* in the (*Archaeologia Cambrensis* report.

The following comment appears in much the same form as it does in the Shrewsbury Chronicle account, except for the qualification that the *scapegoat* is as "mentioned in the Bible":

> The Rev. I. Burleigh James suggested as the origin of the custom the scapegoat mentioned in the Bible.
>
> Mr. Jelinger C. Symons would like to know whether this custom of sin-eating was extinct. If not, to send missionaries abroad would be a farce, while they had customs so disgusting at home.

The President's call to order and personal aside, as well as Symon's response, are exactly as they appeared in the Chronicle report with one slight difference, minor punctuation changes aside: "*such* ceremony" rather than "*much* ceremony".

> The President hoped they were not entering into the history of present customs, but into the history of past events. It struck him that even at the present day when that melancholy event took place, the death of an individual, there was always a certain respect paid to the corpse; it was not closed in the coffin, but was left open for a certain time for the inspection of friends; the room was hung, the candles were lighted, and there was always a person in the room who remained during the time that exhibition took place. It was out of respect to the deceased that such ceremony took place,—he could not regard it in any other light; it had been continued from time immemorial; and, with every degree of respect he should entertain towards that custom, there was nothing in it that he could exclaim against.
>
> Mr. Jelinger C. Symons said, of course his impression was as to the custom of the "sin-eater.”" Some part of the custom appears to arise out of respect to the dead.

The official report then turns to back to Moggridge's response but __omits__ the comments regarding the Duke of Marlborough (`"the Duke of Marlborough was the person he had alluded to. He sent for Dr. Bowles during his sickness, and when the Dr. arrived he found that the Duke was already dead, and the plate and the salt was placed on the body."`). Was this to protect the reputation a former peer of the realm?

Moggridge's response in the official record, as well as the final remarks, then largely follow the text presented in the Chronicle, with just a few minor differences in spelling (*gist* rather than *jist*, *connexion* rathe than *connection*, turn of phrase (*no immediate connexion* rather than *no immediate and direct connection*) and formaility (Mr. Allen as not qualified as a "friend").

The only possibly substantive difference was in the currency of the pratice which he believed *"was extinct now"* rather than *"extinct in the Cwm Amman Valley"*.

> Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of sin-eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped, and the rest still retained; and as he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the sin-eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now.

The last point to note is that in the official report, there was no mention of the vote of thanks. Whether this was by omission, or by design on grounds of formality, we might never know...

## Following the Meeting

In the aftermath of the meeting, it seems that one of the questioners at least was not satisifed with the evidence provided by Mr. Moggridge. For in the October 23rd, 1852 edition of [*Notes and Queries* (Vol 6 Iss 156, p.390)](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1852-10-23_6_156/page/390/mode/2up?q=sin) the following letter appears in the *Minor Queries Answered* section from a certain Jelinger C. Symons:

> Sin-eater. — Can any of your readers explain the origin of "the sin-eater," and give instances of that horrid practice still subsisting in parts of England or Wales, as I am assured it does? It consists in the supposed transfer of the sins of a person recently dead to a man of reprobate character, who eats a piece of bread laid on the chest of the corpse, whereby he is believed to have released the dead man from the responsibility of his sins, and to have taken it on himself; he then receives half-a-crown for his services, and is driven or pursued from the house with execration.

> This practice was the subject of an interesting paper by Mr. Muggridge (*sic*) of Swansea, at the last annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association ; but its origin was not satisfactorily traced. The scapegoat, and the sacrifice of criminals in the arena at Athens, &c., have been suggested. Jelinger C. Symons.

The answer provided offers a biblical interpretation, yet also references the Lansdowne manuscripts referenced by Moggridge as the original source of his quote from Aubrey:

> [The custom is generally supposed to have been taken from the scapegoat in Leviticus xvi. 21, 22. See a curious passage from the Lansdowne MSS. concerning a sin-eater who lived in a cottage on the Rosse highway in Herefordshire, quoted in Brand's Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 247., edit. 1849.]

As was, and still is, customary, the question was picked up and reprinted from Notes and Queries, by several local newspapers, including the [Shrewsbury Chronicle, Friday, November 5th, 1852, p. 3](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000401/18521105/040/0003) (although it gives the page reference as *p.237*, not *p.247*), and [The Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian of 30th October, 1852, p.3](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3090385/3090388/36/), which uses the correct spelling of Mr M*o*ggridge's name, and sticks with the original reference to page 2*4*7.

If there were any replies made direclty to the papers that reprinted the question, I haven't yet found them. But there were two replies I found in [Notes & Queries, December 4th, 1852,Vol 6 Iss 162, p541](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1852-12-04_6_162/page/540/mode/2up?q=sin). The first takes an even harder biblical line than the originally offered answer:

> In addition to your reference to the scape-goat, asaccounting for the custom to which JELINGER C. SYMONS refers, it occurs to me that Hosea iv. 8. might be also quoted: "They *eat up the sin* of my people." "They eat up," that is, "the sin-offering of my people." As the priest of old, by eating the sin-offering, declared in the clearest way that the sins of the guilty offerer *had* been transferred to the victim that was offered, so in some sort it came to be believed by superstitious persons, that the eating a piece of bread which had been taken off the body of a dead man, and offered to another in his behalf, transferred the sins of the deceased to the eater of the bread. Perhaps indeed the practice referred to may be rather traced up to the one great sin-offering of Him who was "made sin" for us, and who "took *bread*," the night He was betrayed at the institution of the Eucharist. "The *bread*" became the representative of the victim on Calvary ; and from the *sin-offering-eater*, or "sin-eater," being a regularly ordained priest — who might, for a consideration, say a mass for the *dead*, —laymen of "reprobate character" usurped his priestly functions, and took that honour to themselves. Some notion at least of the *feast upon a sacrifice* seems to be implied by the proceeding ” referred to by your correspondent.

The second also provides a biblical reference, as well as resorting to classics:

> In Whitby and Doddridge there is a note on 1 Cor. iv. 13. which gives some information on this subject. Whitby, from *Phavorinus*, states the custom referred to to be an Athenian one; but I see, in Pole’s *Synopsis*, that Grotius, in a note on the above passage, refers to Caesar, lib. vi., in proof that a custom of the same kind prevailed among the Gauls. See also Bos, *Exercit. Philolog.*, p. 125., to whom Doddridge refers.

At this point, I suspect my classical languages will fail me if I try to pursue some of those references much further!
