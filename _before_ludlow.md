# Before Ludlow

From *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the official proceedings of the sixth annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Ludlow in 1852, we might reasonably assume that Mr. Matthew Moggridge, Esq., himself learned of the tradition from "Aubrey", writing in the Lansdowne manuscripts, as held by the British Museum, via *Hone’s Year Book*, p. 858.*

A query raised following the meeting by one of those in attendance, Mr. Jelinger C. Symons in *Notes & Queries* also revealed by way of response to perhaps the same in quote appearing in *Brand's Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 247., edit. 1849*.

So in our attempt to track down the origins of the story of the *sin-eater*, let us begin with those two sources before broadening our search to other possible references to the tradition in the years prior to 1852.

Sin Eaters.

Sin-eating is the only that can be used to signify a practice which prevailed with our ancestors. Lawrence Howell, mentioned above, wrote a "History of the Pontificate, in which he mentions a decretal epistle, attributed to a pope Alexander, in the second century, which, by an exposition of "They eat up the sin of my people," *Hosea* iv. 8, implies that this passage signifies "the dignity of priests, who, by their prayers and offerings, eat up the sins of the people." An usage called sin-eating undoubtedly arose in catholic times, and, however it may have been limited to the clergy in early ages, was afterwards continued and practised as a profession, by certain persons called sin-eaters.

In a letter from John Bagford, dated 1715, printed in "Leland's Collectanea," there is the following account of a sin-eater. — "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him,) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool), on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; and a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught." After this, he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, 'the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.' This" says Bagford, "I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, esq., who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen."

Among the Lansdowne MSS., in the British Museum, are statements in Aubrey's own hand writing, to this purport. — "In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin-eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl, of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money : in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead." Aubrey adds, "This custom, though rarely used in our days, yet, by some people, was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian government ; as, at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman, deceased there, had this ceremony punctually performed, according to her will : and, also, the like was done at the city of Hereford, in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowl for the sin-eater; and the like in other places in this county ; as also in Brecon : e. g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom. I believe," says Aubrey, "this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." He states further, "A. D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales."

Bishop White Kennet, who appears to have possessed Aubrey's MS., has added this note. "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford ; where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake and one flaggon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church porch."

SIN EATERS.

The following is extracted from Bagford's letter relating to the antiquities of London, printed in Leland’s Collectanea, i. 76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket ; a crust of bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient heathens ?"

Aubrey's collection, here mentioned, was most probably the Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism, still preserved among the Lansdowne MSS., whence the following remarks on this subject, in Mr. Aubrey’s own hand, have been extracted : "In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. 'And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the goat goe into the wilderness.' This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman de- ceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed, according to her will : and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. ["E.g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome."]  I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." [MS.  Lansd. 226, fol. 116. In another page Aubrey says : "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to  this day in  North Wales;" where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer.]

Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey's MS. : "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church-porch."

DOLES AND INVITATIONS AT FUNERALS.

Doles were used at funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostom, to procure rest to the soul of the deceased, that he might find his judge propitious. [Greek quotation in footnote.]

The giving of a dole, and the inviting of the poor ["Preteria convocabantur et invitabantur necdum sacerdotes et religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." Durand. Had our famous poet, Mr. Pope, an eye to this in ordering, by will, poor men to support his pall ? By the will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, executed April 29, 1397, he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his body at the conventual church of Bustlesham, in which it was to he deposited." See Warner’s Topographical Remarks, relating to the Southwestern parts of Hampshire, ii. 73.] on this occasion, are synonymous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durand. Speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says : “The poor also shed their tears ; precious and fruitful tears, that washed away the sins of the deceased. They let fall floods of redeeming tears.” From such passages as the above in the first Christian writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead.

Strutt, in his English AEra, tells us that Sir Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of Henry IV., died at his manor in Norfolk, and his dead body was brought in a litter to London with great pomp and much torchlight, and it was buried in the White Friars' church, "where was done for him a solemn obsequie, with a great feast and *lyberal dole* to the poore." This custom, says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners, was universally practised all over the kingdom, as well as giving alms to the poor, in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased. Manners and Customs, ii. 209. See a curious account of doles in Dr. Ducarel's Tour through Normandy, fol. ed. p. 81.

Among the articles of expense at the funeral of Sir John Rudstone, Mayor of London, 1531, given by Strutt, iii. 169, from MS. Harl. 1231, we find the following charges : "Item, to the priests at his ennelling, [Anointing with holy oil. See Halliwell’s Dict., p. 61.] 9s. ; to poor folke in almys, 5s. ; 22 days to 6 poor folke, 2s. ; 26 days to a poor folke, 8d." Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, i. 579, speaking of Eskdale chapeiry, says: “Wakes and doles are customary ; and weddings, christenings, and funerals are always attended by the neighbours, sometimes to the amount of a hundred people. The popular diversions are hunting and cock-fighting.” Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, ii. part i. p. 357, speaking of Stathern in Framland hundred, says : "In 1790 there were 432 inhabitants, the number taken by the last person who carried about bread, which was given for *dole* at a funeral ; a custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse. The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by will ; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was sel-dom omitted. On such occasions a small loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect. [Mr, Lysons, in his Environs of London, iii. 341, speaking of some lands said to have been given by two maiden gentlewomen to the parish of Paddington, for the purpose of distributing bread, cheese, and beer among the inhabitants on the Sunday before Christmasday, tells us that they are now let at £21 per annum, and that "the bread was formerly thrown from the church-steeple to be scrambled for, and part of it is still distributed in that way."]

Pennant, in his History of Whiteford Parish, p. 99, says : "Offerings at funerals are kept up here, and, I believe, in all the Welsh churches." He also says : "In North Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of little rolls of bread), which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, laid upon the bier, and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives, over the corpse, to one of the poorest neighbours, three 2d. or four 3d. white loaves of bread, or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister, if present, says the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward for church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor body are brought upon a large dish over the corpse, and the poor body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his friend and neighbour deceased.” This custom is evidently a remain of the *Sin-Eating*, q. v.

It appears from the Statistical Account of Scotland, v. 523, that at Glasgow large donations at funerals are made to the poor, "which are never less than five pounds, and never exceed ten guineas, in which case the bells of the city are tolled."

In Dives and Pauper, First Precept, chap. 63, we read :
"*Dives.* What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoven to the pore folke blynde and lame? — *Pauper*. Comonly in such prive buriynges ben *ful smalle doles and lytel almes yoven, and in solemne buriynges been grete doles and moche almesse [Alms. See examples in nalliwell’s Dict., p. 47. ] yoven, for moche pore people come thanne to seke almesse*. But whanne it is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and fewe come to axe almesse ! for they wote nat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that summe fals executoures that wolde kepe alle to themself biganne firste this errour and this folye, that wolden make themself riche with ded mennys godes, and nat dele to the pore after dedes wylle, as noweall false executoures use by custome." ["The auncient fathers, being veri desirous to move their audience unto charitye and almose dedes, did exhorte them to refresh the poore and to give almoses in the funeralles, and yeares myndes of their frendes and kynnesfolkes, in stedde of the bankettes that the paynymes  and heathen were wont to make at suche doinges, and in stedde of the meates that they did bring to their  sepulchres and graves." The Huntyng of Purgatory, by Veron, 1561, f. 106]

Preface

Letter from John Bagford

Within the memory of our Fathers in Shropshire, in those Villages adjoyning to Wales when a Person dyed, there was notice given to an old Sire, (for so they call'd him,) who presently repair'd to the Place where the deceased lay, and stood before the Door of the House, when some of the Family came out and furnished him with a Cricket, on which he sat down facing the Door. Then they gave him a Groat, which he put in his Pocket, a Crust of Bread which he eat, and a full Bowle of Ale which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the Cricket, and pronounced with a composed Gesture, *The safe and rest of the Soul departed, for which he would pawn his own Soul". This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey Esq; who made a Collectìon of curious Observations, which I bave seen, and is now remaining in the Hands of Mr. Churchill the Bookseller. How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient Heathens?
