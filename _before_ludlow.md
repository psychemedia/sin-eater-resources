# The Road to Ludlow

From *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the official proceedings of the sixth annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Ludlow in 1852, we might reasonably assume that Mr. Matthew Moggridge, Esq., himself learned of the tradition from "Aubrey", writing in the Lansdowne manuscripts, as held by the British Museum, via *Hone’s Year Book*, p. 858.*

A query raised following the meeting by one of those in attendance, Mr. Jelinger C. Symons in *Notes & Queries* also revealed by way of response a reference to the same quote appearing in *Brand's Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 247., edit. 1849*.

So in our attempt to track down the origins of the story of the *sin-eater*, let us begin with those two sources before broadening our search to other possible references to the tradition in the years prior to 1852.

## Hone's Year Book

[*The year book of daily recreation and information*](https://archive.org/details/cu31924029752791)] by William Hone, originally published weekly from January 1831 to January 1832, in 52 numbers was published in a single volume in 1832.

The full title of the book is more correctly recorded as *The year book of daily recreation and information concerning remarkable men and manners, times and seasons, solemnities and merry-makings, antiquities and novelties: on the plan of the Every-Day Book and Table Book, or everlasting calendar of popular amusements, sports, pastimes, ceremonies, customs, and events incident to each of the three hundered and sixty-five days in past and present times; forming a complete history of the year; and a perpetual key to the Almanac; with 114 engravings.*

This work drew on Hone's previous works, [*The Every-Day Book*](https://archive.org/details/everydaybookorgu01hone) and the [*Table Book*](https://archive.org/details/cu31924103708214).

```{admonition} Hone's Every-Day Book
:class: dropdown
*The every day book : or, A guide to the year : describing the popular amusements, sports, ceremonies, manners, customs, and events, incident to the three hundred and sixty-five days, in past and present times* was originally published weekly from Jan. 1825 to Dec. 1826 (105 numbers including indexes).

In the *Explanatory Address to the Readers of The Every-Day Book*, which was originally published in serialised form, Hone describes the publishing model:

> A number, or sheet of thirty-two columns, price threepence, will be published every Saturday till the undertaking is completed, which will be in about a year— a few weeks more or less. The Engravings in each will vary as to number: in some there may be only one or two ; in others, three, or four, or five — according to the subject.
> 45, Ludgate-hill, 31st December, 1824. W. HONE.

See for example this edition of [1878](https://archive.org/details/everydaybookorgu01hone) which includes facsimiles of the title pages from the 1825, 1826, and 1827 editions. The list of topics, again without a corresponding entry, also includes mention of *Sin eaters* in either [volume I](https://archive.org/details/b29326072_0001/page/n8/mode/2up?q=sin) or [Volume II](https://archive.org/details/b29326072_0002/page/n8/mode/2up?q=sin) of the 1826 edition.

The address mentions a variety of topics to be covered by the work including *corpse candles* and *sin eaters*. However, no mention of the sin-eater appears in the work as published.

The yearbook is a daily form of 


It complements the idea of a "commonplace book", a book for recording items of interest: observations, quotes, fragments of correspondence, and so on.

To a certain extent, we might view *Notes & Queries* as a "social commonplace book".
```

In the entry for [July 19th, 1831](https://archive.org/details/cu31924029752791/page/n443/mode/2up?q=sin), on pages 858-9 of *The Year-Book*, we find the following reference to *"Sin Eaters"*.

> Sin-eating is the only that can be used to signify a practice which prevailed with our ancestors. Lawrence Howell, mentioned above, wrote a "History of the Pontificate", in which he mentions a decretal epistle, attributed to a pope Alexander, in the second century, which, by an exposition of "They eat up the sin of my people," *Hosea* iv. 8, implies that this passage signifies "the dignity of priests, who, by their prayers and offerings, eat up the sins of the people." An usage called sin-eating undoubtedly arose in catholic times, and, however it may have been limited to the clergy in early ages, was afterwards continued and practised as a profession, by certain persons called sin-eaters.

This reference to *Hosea* iv. 8 was presumably picked up by the person responding to Symons' letter to *Notes & Queries*; we also have an indication suggestive of catholic origins to the practise.

We then get a more direct statement regarding the folkloric character we are pursuing:

> In a letter from John Bagford, dated 1715, printed in "Leland's Collectanea," there is the following account of a sin-eater. — "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him,) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool), on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; and a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught." After this, he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, 'the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul.' This" says Bagford, "I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, esq., who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen."

Here, then, it would appear that we have new evidence for a visitor in the Shropshire area in the last quarter of the 17th century ("within memory of our fathers", from a basis in 1715) who arrives when a death is announced; who is paid groat (four pence); who sits on a small stool facing the door, eats some bread and drinks a "full bowl" of ale in one go; and who then stands, and with a particular gesture (though what sort of gesture we don't know), makes a ritual pronouncement. Bagford claims this account comes from Aubrey, perhaps as a personal communication, who was collecting and writing in the latter quarter of the seventeenth century.

We are also provided with more information as regards the provenance of the story of the sin-eater, with the account being ascribed to one *John Bagford*, who himself learned of it from "Aubrey".

```

The Year Book then quotes a written description of the sin-eater as provided by Aubrey:

> Among the Lansdowne MSS., in the British Museum, are statements in Aubrey's own hand writing, to this purport. — "In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway.

Which "Rosse highway" is not clear: is it the road out to Hereford, or to Monmouth?

Aubrey then describes the ritual:

> The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin-eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl, of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money : in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead."

Aubrey then reviews other places where the practice is said to occur:

> Aubrey adds, "This custom, though rarely used in our days, yet, by some people, was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian government ; as, at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman, deceased there, had this ceremony punctually performed, according to her will : and, also, the like was done at the city of Hereford, in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowl for the sin-eater; and the like in other places in this county ; as also in Brecon : e. g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom. I believe," says Aubrey, "this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." He states further, "A. D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales."

A reference is then made to what appears to be a commentary on, or attached to, the manuscript itself by Bishop White Kennett:

> Bishop White Kennet, who appears to have possessed Aubrey's MS., has added this note. "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford ; where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake and one flaggon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church porch."

```{admonition} Bishop White Kennet
:class: dropdown
[Bishop White Kennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Kennett) (10 August 1660 – 19 December 1728) was a bishop and antiquarian who lived at the end of the 17th and start of the 18th century. He appears to have held possession of Aubrey's papers relating to the sin-eater that now form part of the Lansdowne manuscripts.

Among his achievements, White Kennet was author of the *Parochial Antiquities attempted in the History of Ambrosden, Burcester, and other adjacent parts in the counties of Oxford and Bucks, with a Glossary of Obsolete Terms* published in Oxford, 1695. Is *Ambrosden* perhaps the same place as "Amersden", where he came upon this ritual whilst preparing his own work? That said, I have found no description of such a ritual (so far!) in my reading of Parochial Antiquities.

https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Kennett,_White  "Many of Kennett's manuscripts, which once formed part of the library of James West, president of the Royal Society, were purchased in 1773 by the Earl of Shelburne (afterwards Marquis of Lansdowne), with whose collection they passed, in 1807, to the British Museum. They are now numbered 935–1041 in the Lansdowne collection."


1818 edition of Parochial Antiquites has a footnote added by the editor that quotes Aubrey but not Kennett's comments?

> SIN EATERS.
>
> The following is extracted from Bagford's letter relating to the antiquities of London, printed in Leland’s Collectanea, i. 76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket ; a crust of bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations, which I have seen, and is now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded from the ancient heathens ?"
>
> Aubrey's collection, here mentioned, was most probably the Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism, still preserved among the Lansdowne MSS., whence the following remarks on this subject, in Mr. Aubrey’s own hand, have been extracted : "In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. 'And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the goat goe into the wilderness.' This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman de- ceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed, according to her will : and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. ["E.g. at Llanggors, where Mr. Gwin, the minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome."] I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." [MS. Lansd. 226, fol. 116. In another page Aubrey says : "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales;" where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer.]
>
> Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey's MS. : "It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the interment, were brought to the minister in the church-porch."

Actually also a second reference in relation to *Doles*

pp. 288-9

> DOLES AND INVITATIONS AT FUNERALS.
>
> Doles were used at funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostom, to procure rest to the soul of the deceased, that he might find his judge propitious. [Greek quotation in footnote.]
>
> The giving of a dole, and the inviting of the poor ["Preteria convocabantur et invitabantur necdum sacerdotes et religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." Durand. Had our famous poet, Mr. Pope, an eye to this in ordering, by will, poor men to support his pall ? By the will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, executed April 29, 1397, he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his body at the conventual church of Bustlesham, in which it was to he deposited." See Warner’s Topographical Remarks, relating to the Southwestern parts of Hampshire, ii. 73.] on this occasion, are synonymous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durand. Speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says : “The poor also shed their tears ; precious and fruitful tears, that washed away the sins of the deceased. They let fall floods of redeeming tears.” From such passages as the above in the first Christian writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead.
>
> Strutt, in his English AEra, tells us that Sir Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of Henry IV., died at his manor in Norfolk, and his dead body was brought in a litter to London with great pomp and much torchlight, and it was buried in the White Friars' church, "where was done for him a solemn obsequie, with a great feast and *lyberal dole* to the poore." This custom, says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners, was universally practised all over the kingdom, as well as giving alms to the poor, in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased. Manners and Customs, ii. 209. See a curious account of doles in Dr. Ducarel's Tour through Normandy, fol. ed. p. 81.
>
> Among the articles of expense at the funeral of Sir John Rudstone, Mayor of London, 1531, given by Strutt, iii. 169, from MS. Harl. 1231, we find the following charges : "Item, to the priests at his ennelling, [Anointing with holy oil. See Halliwell’s Dict., p. 61.] 9s. ; to poor folke in almys, 5s. ; 22 days to 6 poor folke, 2s. ; 26 days to a poor folke, 8d." Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, i. 579, speaking of Eskdale chapeiry, says: “Wakes and doles are customary ; and weddings, christenings, and funerals are always attended by the neighbours, sometimes to the amount of a hundred people. The popular diversions are hunting and cock-fighting.” Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, ii. part i. p. 357, speaking of Stathern in Framland hundred, says : "In 1790 there were 432 inhabitants, the number taken by the last person who carried about bread, which was given for *dole* at a funeral ; a custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse. The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by will ; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was sel-dom omitted. On such occasions a small loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect. [Mr, Lysons, in his Environs of London, iii. 341, speaking of some lands said to have been given by two maiden gentlewomen to the parish of Paddington, for the purpose of distributing bread, cheese, and beer among the inhabitants on the Sunday before Christmasday, tells us that they are now let at £21 per annum, and that "the bread was formerly thrown from the church-steeple to be scrambled for, and part of it is still distributed in that way."]
>
> Pennant, in his History of Whiteford Parish, p. 99, says : "Offerings at funerals are kept up here, and, I believe, in all the Welsh churches." He also says : "In North Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of little rolls of bread), which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, laid upon the bier, and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives, over the corpse, to one of the poorest neighbours, three 2d. or four 3d. white loaves of bread, or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister, if present, says the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward for church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor body are brought upon a large dish over the corpse, and the poor body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his friend and neighbour deceased.” This custom is evidently a remain of the *Sin-Eating*, q. v.
>
> It appears from the Statistical Account of Scotland, v. 523, that at Glasgow large donations at funerals are made to the poor, "which are never less than five pounds, and never exceed ten guineas, in which case the bells of the city are tolled."
>
> In Dives and Pauper, First Precept, chap. 63, we read :
> "*Dives.* What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoven to the pore folke blynde and lame? — *Pauper*.
