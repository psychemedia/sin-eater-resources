"SIN-EATERS.”—In the county of Hereford was 
an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who 
were to take upon them all the sins of the party 
deceased, and were called ‘‘sin-eaters.” One of 
them, I remember, liv’d in a cottage on Rosse high- 
way. The manner was thus: ‘‘ When the corps was 
brought out of the hous, and laid on the biere, a 
loaf of bread was delivered to the sinne eater over 
the corps, as allso a mazar bowle (a gossips bowl of 
maple) full of beer, which he was to drink up, and 
six pence in mony, in consideration whereof he took 
upon him 7so facto all the sinns of the defunct, and 
freed him or her from walking after they were dead. 
In North Wales the sinne eaters are frequently made 
use of ; but there, instead of a bowl of beer, they have 
a,bowl of milk. This custom was by some people ob- 
served even in the strictest time of the presbyterian 
government. As at Dyndar volens nolens the parson 
of the parish, the relations of a woman deceased there 
had this ceremony punctually performed according 
to her will. The like was done in the City of Here- 
ford in those times, where a woman kept, many years 
before her death, a mazar bowl for the sinne-eater ; 
and in other places in the county, as allso at Brecon, 
at Llangors, where Mr. Govin, the minister, about 
1640, could not hinder this superstition. Methinks 
doles to poor people, with mony at funerals, have 
some resemblance of the sinne-eating. Doles at 
funerals were continued at gentlemen’s funerals in the 
west of England till the civil warrs; and so in 
Germany, at rich men’s funerals, doles are in use, and 
to every one a quart of strong and good beer.”
