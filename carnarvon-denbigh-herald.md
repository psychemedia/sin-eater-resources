Mr Elton n. Ede writes to the "Times" from Eden hurst, Heene, Worthing: — "Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice—viz., smok-'ng In church, which I remember niy mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. The Communion table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without anv idea of irreverence."

"THE SIN-EATER IN WALES." if r Y S M. Thomas, writing 011 Mon- ? the "Times" on this subject, baling with" the evidence for 6a.iJ re<;ellt existence of the sin-eater," I should explain, did space ^erlc&I do not regard analogical evi- ^0-) veiy satisfactory for two reasons AUlY.e,:¡r dkiv have misinterpreted a Us Ollv which he saw (he does not tell ft0 name sin-eater was used, I Hot u the sin-eater, if he existed, may of ^asonably be regarded as the result J\!isundie1:standing of othier customs. ^Va]esevi^nce for tlie recenit existence in ■Mf J, r •his personage is the evidence of WlL, °6gtidge—a story related by him, at j and derived no one knows where, fifth Seccnfi hand, perhaps, third, fourth, (,e'Cf hand. Against this we have the evi- ^"oixn of the vicar, the schoolmaster, and the ^iin^rmist nnni^ter—no doubt such a '>Uj. °tlun is enough to damn any cause must remember tliat the schoolmaster ^r° at folk-lore, he had collected a^id customs for Sir Thomas Phil- sPiv-{(, Veri a clergyman and a diocesan in- ^I'is1' r 03,11 e^°it ffho&t stories in a strange Vi .Much more can a local sdiocJiniister 11 ,sin-ea.ter. Secondly, no Welsh writer \Vp]s|Ver mentioned the sin-eater, and no iio 0*1 ^°rd for the name is known. Thirdly, sii;0 ^as ever been produced who saw a ^hcr ?' or heard of him in the localities I Avas to have lived. Even if I fs!l0 Y? Hartland's eanon of evidence fth],. not think that probability lay on liis f?vi,je folding th;»t folk-Jore requiras stricter ^ioij!106 customs, which an eye-witness J^si'ti' misinterpret, I hold to ^my 0ri. that the sin-eater has not existed in 8 xn reeent times."
