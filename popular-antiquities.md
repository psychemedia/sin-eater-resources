SIN EATERS. 

The following is extracted from Bagford’s letter relating to 
the antiquities of London, printed in Leland's Collectanea, i. 
76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: “Within the memory 
of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to 
Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old 
sire (for so tBfey called him), who presently repaired to the 
place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the 
house, when some of the family came out and furnished him 
^ith a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then 

' [It was the practice among the Romans to lay the dead body in the 
porch of their houses, near the threshold, that passengers might inspect 
it, and be satisfied whether there were any signs of a violent death. For 
the benefit of a clearer view, the corpse was set in the position here men- 
tioned, the feet towards the door ; which custom Perseus thus alludes to 
in his third Satire : 

“ See now the trumpets and the torches ! — see 
Our spark laid out in sad solemnity ! 

Stretch’d on the bier, bedaub’d with unguents o’er, 

^ While his stiff heels lie pointed to the door.” 

This mode of placing the dead was likewise in use among the Greeks, 
Horn. 11. xix. V. 212.]

they gave him a groat, wJiich he put in his pocket ; a crust of 
bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank 
off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and 
jironounccd, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of 
the sold departed for which he would pawn his own soul. 
This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made 
a collection of curious observations, which 1 have seen, and is 
now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. 
How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded 
from they ancient heathens?” ^ 

Aubrey’s collection, here mentioned, was most probably the 
Remaines of Gentilisrae and J udaism,iPtiU preserved among 
the Lansdowne MS8., whence the following remarks on this 
subject, in Mr. Aubrey’s own hand, have been extracted : “In 
the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to 
hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of 
the party deceased. One of them (he w^as a long, leane,*ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on 
Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread 
w as brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, 
as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to 
drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof 
he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and 
freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This cus- 
tome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old 
lawc, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. ‘And Aaron shall lay both his hands 
on the head of the live goate, and coufesse over him all the ini- 
quities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions 
in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the^oat, and 
shall send him aw ay by the hand of a fit man into the wilder- 
ness; And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities 
unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the goat goe into 
the wilderness.’ This custome, though rarely used in our 
dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest 
time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens 
nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman de- 
ceased there had this ccremonie punctually performed, accord- 
ing to her will : and also the like was done at tl^ city of 
Hereford in those times, where a womaii kept, many yeares 
before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater ; and the

like in^otber places in this countie; as also in Brecon.* I 
believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. 

Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey’s MS. : “It 
seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at 
Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of 
every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the 
interment, were brought to the minister in the church -porch.”
