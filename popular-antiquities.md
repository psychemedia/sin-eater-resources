p155-6

The  following  is  extracted  from  Mr.  Bagford's  Letter  relating  to  the  Antiqui- ties of  London,  printed  in  the  first  volume  of  Leland's  Collectanea,  p.  Ixxvi. It  is  dated  Feb.  1,  1714-5.
"  Within  the  memory  of  our  Fathers,  in  Shropshire,  in  those  villages  adjoyn- ing  to  Wales,  when  a  person  dyed,  there  was  notice  given  to  an  old  Sire,  (for so  they  called  him,)  who  presently  repaired  to  the  place  where  the  deceased  lay, and  stood  before  the  door  of  the  house,  when  some  of  the  Family  came  out  and furnished  him  with  a  Cricket,  on  which  he  sat  down  facing  the  door.  Then they  gave  him  a  Groat,  which  he  put  in  his  pocket;  a  Crust  of  Bread,  which  he eat;  and  a  full  bowle  of  Ale,  which  he  drank  off  at  a  draught.  After  this,  he got  up  from  the  Cricket  and  pronounced,  with  a  composed  gesture,  the  ease and  rest  of  the  Soul  departed,  for  which  he  would  pawn  his  own  Soul.  This I  had  from  the  ingenious  John  Aubrey,  Esq.  who  made  a  Collection  of  curious Observations,  which  I  have  seen,  and  is  now  remaining  in  the  hands  of  Mr. Churchill,  the  bookseller.  How  can  a  Man  think  otherwise  of  this,  than  that it  proceeded  from  the  ancient  Heathens  ?"
[Aubrey's  Collection,  here  mentioned,  was  most  probably  the  "  Rernaines  of Gentilisme  and  Judaism,"  still  preserved  among  the  Lansdowne  Manuscripts  in the  British  Museum  ;  whence  the  following  remarks  on  this  subject,  in  Mr.  Au^ brey's  own  hand,  have  been  extracted.
See  the  Tragique  Historic  of  the  faire  Valeria  of  London,  1598.  "  His  Corpes  was  with  funeral! pompe  conveyed  to  the  Church  and  there  solemnly  enterred,  nothing  omitted  which  necessitie  or custom  could  claime:  a  Sermon,  a  Banquet,  and  like  observations."
Again,  in  the  old  Romance  of  Syr  Degore,  6.  1.  no  date  ;
"  A  great  Feaste  would  he  holds
Upon  his  Queue's  Mornynge  Day,
That  was  buryed  in  an  Abbay."
See  also  Hayward'i  Life  and  Relgne  of  King  Henry  the  fourth,  4to.  1599.  p.  135.  "  Then  he^ (King  Richard  II.)  was  conveyed  to  Langley  Abby  in  Buckinghamshire,  and  there  obscurely  in- terred, without  the  charge  of  a  Dinner  for  celebrating  the  Funeral."


"  In  the  County  of  Hereford  was  an  old  Custome  at  Funeralls  to  hire  poor People,  who  were  to  take  upon  them  the  Sinnes  of  the  Party  deceased.  One of  them,  (he  was  a  long,  leane,  ugly,  lamentable  poor  Raskal,)  I  remember  lived in  a  Cottage  on  Rosse  high-way.  The  manner  was,  that  when  the  Corps  was brought  out  of  the  House,  and  layd  on  the  Biere,  a  Loafe  of  Bread  was  brought out,  and  delivered  to  the  Sinne  Eater,  over  the  Corps,  as  also  a  Mazar  Bowie, of  Maple,  full  of  Beer,  (which  he  was  to  drink  up,)  and  Sixpence  in  money ; in  consideration  whereof  he  took  upon  him,  ipso  facto,  all  the  Sinnes  of  the  de- funct, and  freed  him  or  her  from  walking  after  they  were  dead.  This  custome alludes,  methinks,  something  to  the  Scape-Goate  in  the  old  Lawe,  Levit.  chap, xvi.  v.  21,  22.  '.And  Aaron  shall  lay  both  his  hands  on  the  head  of  the  live Goate,  and  confesse  over  him  all  the  iniquities  of  the  Children  of  Israel,  and all  their  transgressions  in  all  their  sins,  putting  them  upon  the  head  of  the  Goat, and  shall  send  him  away  by  the  hand  of  a  fit  man  into  the  Wilderness.  And the  Goat  shall  bear  upon  him  all  their  iniquities  unto  a  Land  not  inhabited  :  and he  shall  let  the  Goat  goe  into  the  Wilderness.'
"  This  Custome,  (though  rarely  used  in  our  dayes )  yet  by  some  people  was observed  even  in  the  strictest  time  of  the  Presbyterian  Government,  as  at  Dyn- der,  (volens  nolens  the  Parson  of  the  Parish,)  the  kindred  of  a  Woman  deceased there  had  this  Ceremonie  punctually  performed,  according  to  her  Will :  and, also,  the  like  was  done  at  the  City  of  Hereford  in  those  times,  where  a  Woman kept,  many  yeares  before  her  death,  a  Mazard  Bowie  for  the  Sinne-Eater;  and the  like  in  other  places  in  this  Countie  :  as  also  in  Brecon1.  I  believe  this  Cus- tom was  heretofore  used  all  over  Wales  b.]
1  ["E.g.  at  Llanggors,  where  Mr.  Gwin,  the  Minister,  about  1640.  could  not  hinder  the  per- formance of  this  ancient  Custome."
b  MS.  Lansd.  2<26.  fol.  116.  In  another  page,  Mr.  Aubrey  says  :  "  A.  D.  1CS6.  This  Custom  is used  to  this  day  in  North  Wales  :"  where  Milk  seems  to  have  been  the  substitute  for  Beer.
Bishop  Kennet,  in  whose  possession  Aubrey's  Manuscript  appears  to  have  been,  has  added  this Note.  "  It  seems  a  remainder  of  this  Custom  which  lately  obtained  at  Amersden  in  the  County  of Oxford,  where  at  the  burial  of  every  Corpse,  one  Cake  and  one  Flaggon  of  Ale,  just  after  the interment,  were  brought  to  the  Minister  in  the  Church  Porch."]

Mr.  Pennant's  MS.  relative  to  North  Wales,  says  :  "  In  North  Wales,  pence  and  half-pence,  (in 
lieu  of  little  rolls  of  Bread)  which  were  heretofore,  and  by  some  still  are,  given  on  these  occasions,

f  Mr.  Lysons,  in  his  Environs  of  London,  vol.  iii.  p.  341.  speaking  of  some  lands  said  to  have  been  given  by 
two  maiden  gentlewomen,  to  the  parish  of  Paddington,  for  the  purpose  of  distributing  Bread,  Cheese,  and  Beer, 
among  the  inhabitants  on  the  Sunday  before  Christmas  Day,  tells  us  that  they  are  now  let  at  21i.  per  annum, 
and  that  "  the  bread  was  formerly  thrown  from  the  Church  steeple  to  be  scrambled  for,  and  part  of  it  is  still  dis- 
tributed in  that  way."

who  mourned  on  the  occasion,  he  says  :  "The  poor  also  shed  their  Tears  ;  pre-~> 
cious  and  fruitful  Tears,  that  washed  away  the  Sins  of  the  deceased.     They  let 
fall  floods  of  redeeming  Teares."     From  such  passages  as  the  above  in  the  first  / 
Christian  Writers0,  literally  understood,  the  Romanists  may  have  derived  their  | 
superstitious  doctrine  of  praying  for  the  dead. 

corpse  is  brought  out.  When  the  corpse  is  brought  out  of  the  house,  layd  upon  the  bier  and  co- 
vered, before  it  be  taken  up,  the  next  of  kin  to  the  deceased,  widow,  mother,  daughter  or  cousin, 
(never  done  by  a  man)  gives  over  the  corps  to  one  of  the  poorest  Neighbours  three  Zd.  or  four  3d. 
white  Loaves  of  Bread,  or  a  Cheese  with  a  piece  of  money  stuck  in  it,  and  then  a  new  wooden  Cup  of 
Drink,  which  some  will  require  the  poor  person  who  receives  it  immediately  to  drink  a  little  of. 
When  this  is  done,  the  Minister,  if  present,  says  the  Lord's  Prayer,  and  then  they  set  forward  for 
Church.  The  things  mentioned  above  as  given  to  a  poor  Body,  are  brought  upon  a  large  Dish, 
over  the  Corpse,  and  the  poor  Body  returns  thanks  for  them,  and  blesses  God  for  the  happiness  of 
his  Friend  and  Neighbour  deceased."  [This  custom  is  evidently  a  remain  of  the  Sin-Eating, 
see  pp.155.  156.]

SIN EATERS. 

The following is extracted from Bagford’s letter relating to 
the antiquities of London, printed in Leland's Collectanea, i. 
76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: “Within the memory 
of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to 
Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old 
sire (for so tBfey called him), who presently repaired to the 
place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the 
house, when some of the family came out and furnished him 
^ith a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then 

' [It was the practice among the Romans to lay the dead body in the 
porch of their houses, near the threshold, that passengers might inspect 
it, and be satisfied whether there were any signs of a violent death. For 
the benefit of a clearer view, the corpse was set in the position here men- 
tioned, the feet towards the door ; which custom Perseus thus alludes to 
in his third Satire : 

“ See now the trumpets and the torches ! — see 
Our spark laid out in sad solemnity ! 

Stretch’d on the bier, bedaub’d with unguents o’er, 

^ While his stiff heels lie pointed to the door.” 

This mode of placing the dead was likewise in use among the Greeks, 
Horn. 11. xix. V. 212.] 



SIN EATERS.

they gave him a groat, wJiich he put in his pocket ; a crust of 
bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank 
off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and 
jironounccd, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of 
the sold departed for which he would pawn his own soul. 
This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made 
a collection of curious observations, which 1 have seen, and is 
now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. 
How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded 
from they ancient heathens?” ^ 

Aubrey’s collection, here mentioned, was most probably the 
Remaines of Gentilisrae and J udaism,iPtiU preserved among 
the Lansdowne MS8., whence the following remarks on this 
subject, in Mr. Aubrey’s own hand, have been extracted : “In 
the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to 
hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of 
the party deceased. One of them (he w^as a long, leane,*ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on 
Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread 
w as brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, 
as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to 
drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof 
he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and 
freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This cus- 
tome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old 
lawc, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. ‘And Aaron shall lay both his hands 
on the head of the live goate, and coufesse over him all the ini- 
quities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions 
in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the^oat, and 
shall send him aw ay by the hand of a fit man into the wilder- 
ness; And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities 
unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the goat goe into 
the wilderness.’ This custome, though rarely used in our 
dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest 
time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens 
nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman de- 
ceased there had this ccremonie punctually performed, accord- 
ing to her will : and also the like was done at tl^ city of 
Hereford in those times, where a womaii kept, many yeares 
before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater ; and the

like in^otber places in this countie; as also in Brecon.* I 
believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. 

Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey’s MS. : “It 
seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at 
Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of 
every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the 
interment, were brought to the minister in the church -porch.”

dole. — The giving of a dole, and the 
inviting of the poor on this occasion, are 
synonynious terms. There are some strong 
figurative expressions on this subject in 
St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration ou Satyrus, 
cited by Durandus. Speaking of those 
who mourned on the occasion, he says: — 
"The poor also shed their tears; precious 
and fruitful tears, that washed away the 
sins of the deceased. They let fall Hoods 
of redeeming tears." Krom such passages 
as the above in the first Christian writers, 
literally understood, the Romanists may 
have derived their superstitious doctrine 
of praying for the dead. " Preterea con- 
Tocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacer- 
dotes et Religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." 
Durandus. Had Pope an eye to this in 
ordering by will poor men to support his 

fiallp Doles were used at funerals, as we 
earn from St, Chrvsostom, to procure rest 
to the soul of the deceased, that he might 
find his judge propitious. Homilia in 
Matthei cap. i). 

In"Dives and Pauper," H93, we read: 
" Dives. What seyst thou of them that 
wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, 
but be putt in erthe anon, and that that 
shukle be spent aboute the buriyng they 
bj-dde that it shukle be yoven to the pore 
folke blynde and lame.'' — I'auper. Comonly 
in such pri\e buriyuges bene ful smalfe 
doles and lytel nimes yoven, and in solemne 
buriynges been grete doles and moche 
almesse yoven, for moche pore people come 
thanne to seke almesse. But whanne it 
is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and 
fewe come to axe almesse 1 for they wote 
oat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde 
axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that 
summe fals executoures that wolde kepe 
all to themself biganne firste this errour 
and this fovle, that wolden make themself 
richo with ded mennys gojjes, and nat dele 
to the pore after dedes wylle, as nowe all 
false executoures use bv custome," By 
the will of William de M^ontacute, Earl of 
Salisbury (1397), he directs " that twenty- 
five shillings should be daily distributed 
among three hundred poor people from the 
time of his death to the arrival of his body 
at the Conventual Church of Bustle- 
ham [Bustlcton] in which it was to 
be deposited." Warner's Hampshire, 
11, 73. Strutt tells ua that Sir 
Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of 
Henry IV. died at his Manor in Norfolk, 
and his dead body was brought in a litter 
to London with great pump, and much 



torch-light, and it was buried in the Wliite 
Friars Church, " where was done for him a 
solemn obsequie, with a great feaste and 
lyberal dole to the poore." This custom, 
says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the 
chief mourners, was universally practised 
all over the kingdom, as well as giving 
alms to the poor, in proportion to the 
quality and finances of the deceased. 
Manners and Customs, ii., 109. Nichols, 
speaking of Stathorn in Framland Hun- 
dred, says : "In 1790, there were 432 in- 
habitants ; the number taken by the last 
person who carried about bread, which 
was given for dote at a, funeral; a custom 
formerly common throughout this part 
of England, though now fallen much 
into disuse. The practice was some- 
times to bequeath it by will ; but, 
wiiether so specified or not, the cere- 
mony was seldom omitted. On such 
occasions a small loaf was sent to 
every person, without anv distinction of 
age or circumstances, and, not to receive 
it was a mark of particular disrespect." 
Leicestershire J vol. ii., part i., p. 3o7. Ly- 
sons's Env., lii., 341. Pennant says; — 
" Offerings at funerals are kept up here 
(Whiteford), and I believe, in all the 
Welsh Churches." Hist, of Whiteford, p. 
99. The same writer observes : " In North 
Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of 
little rolls of bread) which were hereto- 
fore, and by some still are, given on these- 
occasions, are now distributed to the poor, 
who flock in great numbers to the house of 
the dead before the corpse is brought out. 
When the corpse is brought out of the 
house, layd upon the bier and covered, be- 
fore it be taken up, the next of kin to the 
dctceased, widow, mother, daughter, or 
cousin (never done by a man), gives over 
the corps to one of the poorest neighbours 
three 2d. or four 3d. whit« loaves of bread, 
or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in 
it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, 
wliich some will require the poor person 
who receives it immediately to drink a 
little of. When this is done, the minister, 
if present, says the Lord's Prayer, and 
then they set forward for church. Th» 
things mentioned above as given to a poor 
body, are brought upon a large dish, over 
the corpse, and the poor body returns 
thanks for them, and blesses God for the 
happiness of his friend and neighbour de- 
ceased." Compare Sin-Eater and Ditch- 
field, chap. 18. In the 18th century, it ap- 
pears that at Glasgow large donations at 
funerals were made to the poor, "which 
are never less than £5, and never exceeded 
ten guineas, in which case the bells of th» 
city are tolled." Stat. Ace. of Scotland, 
V. 523. It was formerly customary for » 
sum of money to be given to certain rer- 
sons or institutions, with whom or which 
the deceased had been connected. This 



i86 



NATIONAL FAITHS 



usage is illustrated by a. document inserted 
among the " Kgertoii Papers," being tlie 
meuionitida relating to tlio will of one of 
the Rokeby family, who died in ICiOO. 
Among the items are gifts of sums of 
money to the principals of Liucoln's Inn, 
Furnival's Jim, and I'liavis' Jnii, for drink 
to be supplied to the members of tlioKo 
societies in honour of the occasion. This 
custom of funeral libations is still not un- 
common in the country. By his will made 
in lt)3'J, Francis Pyuner, of Bury St. Ed- 
munds, directed that out of certain rents 
and revenues accruing from his propertv, 
from and after the Michaelmas following 
his decease, forty poor parishioners of St. 
Mary's, Bury, should, on coming to the 
church, be entitled to a twopenny wheaten 
loaf on the Inst Friday in every moutji 
throughout the year, for ever. See a curi- 
-ous account of doles in Ducarel's Tour 
through Normandy.
