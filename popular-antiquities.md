SIN EATERS. 

The following is extracted from Bagford’s letter relating to 
the antiquities of London, printed in Leland's Collectanea, i. 
76. It is dated February 1, 1714-5: “Within the memory 
of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to 
Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old 
sire (for so tBfey called him), who presently repaired to the 
place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the 
house, when some of the family came out and furnished him 
^ith a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then 

' [It was the practice among the Romans to lay the dead body in the 
porch of their houses, near the threshold, that passengers might inspect 
it, and be satisfied whether there were any signs of a violent death. For 
the benefit of a clearer view, the corpse was set in the position here men- 
tioned, the feet towards the door ; which custom Perseus thus alludes to 
in his third Satire : 

“ See now the trumpets and the torches ! — see 
Our spark laid out in sad solemnity ! 

Stretch’d on the bier, bedaub’d with unguents o’er, 

^ While his stiff heels lie pointed to the door.” 

This mode of placing the dead was likewise in use among the Greeks, 
Horn. 11. xix. V. 212.]

they gave him a groat, wJiich he put in his pocket ; a crust of 
bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank 
off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and 
jironounccd, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of 
the sold departed for which he would pawn his own soul. 
This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made 
a collection of curious observations, which 1 have seen, and is 
now remaining in the hands of Mr. Churchill, the bookseller. 
How can a man think otherwise of this, than that it proceeded 
from they ancient heathens?” ^ 

Aubrey’s collection, here mentioned, was most probably the 
Remaines of Gentilisrae and J udaism,iPtiU preserved among 
the Lansdowne MS8., whence the following remarks on this 
subject, in Mr. Aubrey’s own hand, have been extracted : “In 
the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to 
hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of 
the party deceased. One of them (he w^as a long, leane,*ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on 
Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread 
w as brought out and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, 
as also a mazar bowle, of maple, full of beer (which he was to 
drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof 
he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and 
freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This cus- 
tome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old 
lawc, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. ‘And Aaron shall lay both his hands 
on the head of the live goate, and coufesse over him all the ini- 
quities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions 
in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the^oat, and 
shall send him aw ay by the hand of a fit man into the wilder- 
ness; And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities 
unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the goat goe into 
the wilderness.’ This custome, though rarely used in our 
dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest 
time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens 
nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman de- 
ceased there had this ccremonie punctually performed, accord- 
ing to her will : and also the like was done at tl^ city of 
Hereford in those times, where a womaii kept, many yeares 
before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater ; and the

like in^otber places in this countie; as also in Brecon.* I 
believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. 

Bishop Kennett has added this note to Aubrey’s MS. : “It 
seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at 
Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where, at the burial of 
every corpse, one cake and one flagon of ale, just after the 
interment, were brought to the minister in the church -porch.”

dole. — The giving of a dole, and the 
inviting of the poor on this occasion, are 
synonynious terms. There are some strong 
figurative expressions on this subject in 
St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration ou Satyrus, 
cited by Durandus. Speaking of those 
who mourned on the occasion, he says: — 
"The poor also shed their tears; precious 
and fruitful tears, that washed away the 
sins of the deceased. They let fall Hoods 
of redeeming tears." Krom such passages 
as the above in the first Christian writers, 
literally understood, the Romanists may 
have derived their superstitious doctrine 
of praying for the dead. " Preterea con- 
Tocabantur et invitabantur necdum Sacer- 
dotes et Religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." 
Durandus. Had Pope an eye to this in 
ordering by will poor men to support his 

fiallp Doles were used at funerals, as we 
earn from St, Chrvsostom, to procure rest 
to the soul of the deceased, that he might 
find his judge propitious. Homilia in 
Matthei cap. i). 

In"Dives and Pauper," H93, we read: 
" Dives. What seyst thou of them that 
wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, 
but be putt in erthe anon, and that that 
shukle be spent aboute the buriyng they 
bj-dde that it shukle be yoven to the pore 
folke blynde and lame.'' — I'auper. Comonly 
in such pri\e buriyuges bene ful smalfe 
doles and lytel nimes yoven, and in solemne 
buriynges been grete doles and moche 
almesse yoven, for moche pore people come 
thanne to seke almesse. But whanne it 
is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and 
fewe come to axe almesse 1 for they wote 
oat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde 
axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that 
summe fals executoures that wolde kepe 
all to themself biganne firste this errour 
and this fovle, that wolden make themself 
richo with ded mennys gojjes, and nat dele 
to the pore after dedes wylle, as nowe all 
false executoures use bv custome," By 
the will of William de M^ontacute, Earl of 
Salisbury (1397), he directs " that twenty- 
five shillings should be daily distributed 
among three hundred poor people from the 
time of his death to the arrival of his body 
at the Conventual Church of Bustle- 
ham [Bustlcton] in which it was to 
be deposited." Warner's Hampshire, 
11, 73. Strutt tells ua that Sir 
Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of 
Henry IV. died at his Manor in Norfolk, 
and his dead body was brought in a litter 
to London with great pump, and much 



torch-light, and it was buried in the Wliite 
Friars Church, " where was done for him a 
solemn obsequie, with a great feaste and 
lyberal dole to the poore." This custom, 
says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the 
chief mourners, was universally practised 
all over the kingdom, as well as giving 
alms to the poor, in proportion to the 
quality and finances of the deceased. 
Manners and Customs, ii., 109. Nichols, 
speaking of Stathorn in Framland Hun- 
dred, says : "In 1790, there were 432 in- 
habitants ; the number taken by the last 
person who carried about bread, which 
was given for dote at a, funeral; a custom 
formerly common throughout this part 
of England, though now fallen much 
into disuse. The practice was some- 
times to bequeath it by will ; but, 
wiiether so specified or not, the cere- 
mony was seldom omitted. On such 
occasions a small loaf was sent to 
every person, without anv distinction of 
age or circumstances, and, not to receive 
it was a mark of particular disrespect." 
Leicestershire J vol. ii., part i., p. 3o7. Ly- 
sons's Env., lii., 341. Pennant says; — 
" Offerings at funerals are kept up here 
(Whiteford), and I believe, in all the 
Welsh Churches." Hist, of Whiteford, p. 
99. The same writer observes : " In North 
Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of 
little rolls of bread) which were hereto- 
fore, and by some still are, given on these- 
occasions, are now distributed to the poor, 
who flock in great numbers to the house of 
the dead before the corpse is brought out. 
When the corpse is brought out of the 
house, layd upon the bier and covered, be- 
fore it be taken up, the next of kin to the 
dctceased, widow, mother, daughter, or 
cousin (never done by a man), gives over 
the corps to one of the poorest neighbours 
three 2d. or four 3d. whit« loaves of bread, 
or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in 
it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, 
wliich some will require the poor person 
who receives it immediately to drink a 
little of. When this is done, the minister, 
if present, says the Lord's Prayer, and 
then they set forward for church. Th» 
things mentioned above as given to a poor 
body, are brought upon a large dish, over 
the corpse, and the poor body returns 
thanks for them, and blesses God for the 
happiness of his friend and neighbour de- 
ceased." Compare Sin-Eater and Ditch- 
field, chap. 18. In the 18th century, it ap- 
pears that at Glasgow large donations at 
funerals were made to the poor, "which 
are never less than £5, and never exceeded 
ten guineas, in which case the bells of th» 
city are tolled." Stat. Ace. of Scotland, 
V. 523. It was formerly customary for » 
sum of money to be given to certain rer- 
sons or institutions, with whom or which 
the deceased had been connected. This

usage is illustrated by a. document inserted 
among the " Kgertoii Papers," being tlie 
meuionitida relating to tlio will of one of 
the Rokeby family, who died in ICiOO. 
Among the items are gifts of sums of 
money to the principals of Liucoln's Inn, 
Furnival's Jim, and I'liavis' Jnii, for drink 
to be supplied to the members of tlioKo 
societies in honour of the occasion. This 
custom of funeral libations is still not un- 
common in the country. By his will made 
in lt)3'J, Francis Pyuner, of Bury St. Ed- 
munds, directed that out of certain rents 
and revenues accruing from his propertv, 
from and after the Michaelmas following 
his decease, forty poor parishioners of St. 
Mary's, Bury, should, on coming to the 
church, be entitled to a twopenny wheaten 
loaf on the Inst Friday in every moutji 
throughout the year, for ever. See a curi- 
-ous account of doles in Ducarel's Tour 
through Normandy.
