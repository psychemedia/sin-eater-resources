Welsh Morality
WELSBL MORALITY, [: i AN ENGLISH PHYSICIAN ON WELSH BUNDLING." THE "BRITISH MEDICAL jouRwAL,,p ANQ ITS CORRESPONDENTS. From time to t'ime astounding instances reach US of English ignorance with regard to Welsh national habits and customs. Not many months ago itnoto in the Red Drajton calling attention to a sillystato ment anent" The Sin Eater by the Rev. Paxtoii Hood in his book on Christmas Evans vmg UK I means of eliciting from Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P., 40 accomplished antiquarian, of Oswestry, a racist abl 1 paper, in which the whole myth was so triumph1 antly demolished that many a warm Welshman must have felt tempted to apply to its prowaulgatoi the words used by Giffard to another equally ew-er- ticial observer, old John Aubrey. Perhaps ft too much to expect strict accuracy on Welsh matters of a writer like Mr. Paxton Hood, who once do, scribed Llanidloes as the home of the really great poet, John Dyer," and, mirabile dictu! spoke of Grongar Hill as a delicious spo £ in ti-t neigh, bourhood." Mr. Hood, with the usual lightness of a professional bookmaker, appears to have hashed up the story of The Sin Eater" from Murray's ( Handbook to South Wales," withouttroubliog hinv self to alter much of the phraseology, still less W inquire into the existence of the revolting custouf either now or at any time past. It becomes our duty to call attention to u even worse example of ignorance, because exhi- bited by a person accustomed by his ordinarj pursuits to greater accuracy, both of investigation. and of thought, than a mere raconteur like Mr. Hood. In the British lIfrlicéd Jcrarnal of April 14 this year appeared the third of the Gulstoniftn Lectures on The Sterility of Women," delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in February, 1883, by J. Matthews Duncan, M.D., LL.D., Stet Physician-Accoucheur and Lecturer on Midwifery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of the heads of the lecture deals with the sterility alleged to be dependent on some inscrutable incompatibility of the parties, as in Augustus and Livia, Napoleon and Josephine," after which follow certain observa- tions which, however proper to a professional journal, would be decidedly out of place in one likr our own. These directly lead up to a statement that religion, morals, and law continue to inter- dict the cure that might result" from the adoption of a natural method indicated by the lecturer. And immediately afterwards comes the following asser- tion, infamous in its purport and astonishing in the information it conveys, which we have reluc- tantly felt compelled to reproduce in full:- Unfortunately, however, among large classes -chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of I-e-ustoiii permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice wh; jh produces many illustra- tions of this mutual incompatability. The practicf is called bundling, or keeping company, and con- sists in parents permitting daughters to cohabit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage tie is made. A woman proving sterile may be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is1 different." Now, we do not wish to characterise this as 1\ wicked invention from first to last, because we are perfectly well aware that there have been some absurd notions afloat with respect to the Welsla custom of bundling," which may have had some slight substratum of fact. But what we do say, and say most emphatically, is that the custom, when- ever and wherever it might have prevailed, was not the infamous thing here described. If the facts were investigated we unhesitatingly assert that they would disclose no more harmful a state of affairs than is witnessed in every day courtship in English or Scotch life. Indeed, if the. decision were left to us, we should say that, as com- pared with the blue-china and stained-glass window attitudes of those languishing youths and maidenf with whom Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan have made us acquainted, those adopted by the Bundlers (whom we admit, for the sake of our illustration, to exist) are much the more whole- some of the two. That such an infamous imputa- tion against the morals of Welsh parents and Welsh children shouldhave been uttered orprinted without careful inquiry into the facts is almost inconceiv- able. That such an abominable accusation should have been allowed to pass unchallenged woulo have been less conceivable still. We were there- fore pleased to find the cudgels taken up with som-r warmth on behalf of the Welsh people by Mr. E Rice Morgan, Morriston, who, in a letter to th, editor of the British Medical Journal, printed io its issue of May 5, says WELSH MORALITY. SIR,—On page 702 of your journal for the 14th instant, Dr. Matthews Duncan states thus■ Unfoiiuostoly, bow«v«r, umoag lax&a plneaoir chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scot. land—custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illus, trations of this mutual incompatability. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohabit with an eligible man on the understand- ing that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage is made. A woman proving sterile may be deserted j by her follower, and gets another with whom tbw result is different." I know the habits of the Welsh well, and; though they arc far from what could be wished; there is no such practice as Dr. Duncan alludes to To make such a statement and allow it to be printed is a gross moral blunder. I would suggest to Dr. Duncan to examine more closely into the morals of his own country. Let him examine and compare the statistics of illegitimacy there and here. I should be glad to see them printed.- Yours obediently, E. RICE MORGAN. This communication attracted the notice of Dr Dd. Thomas, Ystalvfera, who, thinking the charge made by Dr. Matthews Duncan should not W allowed to remain without a further attempt at refutation, also wrote the editor a letter on thf subject, but beyond an acknowledgment of its receipt no further notice was taken of it in tlte columns of the British Medical Journal. Through the courtesy of Dr. Thomas we are enabled tc publish a copy of this letter. It is as follows :— TO THE EDITOR OF THE" BRITISH MKDJCALJOUtKAL.* SIR,—I am glad to find my friend, Mr. E. Ricf Morgan, has entered nis protest against tne oaiouf and unwarrantable statement made by Dr. Matthews Duncan as to Welsh morality in his ad- dress on "Steritity," as published recently in your journal (vide page 702, April 14). I have lived nearly all my life in Wales, and from what I know of the habits of the people I am glad of this opportunity to endorse every worcl that Mr. Morgan says. Between the Judge-Advocate-General (who claims to represent in Parliament the opinion ot the Welsh Principality) saying "that the Welsh people hated tests more than they hated Atheists and Dr. Duncan's infamous accusation as to tho existence of "bundling" in Wales, I fear our friends beyond Offi. Dyke will credit us with a less degree of civilisation than what they have hitherto done. True, nearly all the Welsh members voted for tho Bradlaugh Relief Bill; but I an* satisfied that many did so more for the sake of fol- lowing their leader than of representing the voice of their constituents. And I fear Dr. Duncan niadri his i-ockless statement more with the view of writing a sensational paper than of putting before the public a plain statement of facts. On reading over Dr. Duncan's address, and particularly that part of it with reference to "bundling," I could not but be struck with the recollection of a little pamphlet which appeared in Edinburgh some twenty years or more g called The Mysteries of the Temple," By a.n Acolyte." This production was supposed to he » take-off on the then practice of the late Sir Jarne! Simpson but. as it was written with little or nc regard for truth, it was suppressed after but a short existence. For my own part, and for thtf sake of the reputation of my countrymen ane i countrywomen, I would be glad to find a similar fate befall Dr. Duncan's address rather than it should be the means of disseminating broadcast such erroneous statements as it contains, and' thereby branding a whole nation with gross im. morality.—I remain, sir, your obedient servant, DD. THOMAS, M.D. Ystalvfera, 7th May, 1833. This letter was not a whit too scathing itt view of the aggravated character of t.h< charge to which it was intended as a reply. That it was refused insertion may not impossibly be taken as only another instance of how very much more ready the owners of some English minds are to give currency to any scandalous rumour, no mtttet how flimsy and untrustworthy, concerning their Welsh neighbours than to afford the latter a full and fair opportunity of self-justification. Whatever the editor of the British Medical Journal may have thought of Br. Thomas's letter, we are quite sure that all Welsh people, and all right-minded English people as well, will ,feel thankful to the Doctor fop having written it. The Duncans and the Paxton Hoods of the country are people *rho must taught that they cannot malign their neighbours* whenever it pleases them, with impunity.

THe Week 
The interesting- discussion which followed Captain Hinde's paper on cannibali-m before the -anthropological section of the British Association at Ipswich on Saturday brought to light one or two facts connected with Welsh social life which are entitled to a passing notice. Mr. Hartland, of Gloucester, referred1 in, the course of his comments to an old custom which obtained in Wales in times gone by, and which was called "sin-eating." As late as 1851 traces of it still survived in the Swansea Valley, and it would be worth while inquiring whether they have com- pletely disappeared. The "sin-eater" wa.s the individual who literally "took the cake" at the death of a neighbour, and in oorisum- Jhg it was supposed to "eat" the sins of the deceased. The custom was a relic of bar- barism, and shows with what tena- city old beliefs and institutions hold on. The student of man and his ways must feel regret that so many ancient customs and usages have been relegated to oblivion. beyond any possibility of re-call. But it was hardly expected that they should have survived in a country like Wailies, which has given itself over to the Sunday ociiool and the Bible. It is a mistaken policy, however, to drive out ancient customs, for they form links between the present and the past, and relieve modern social life of much of the monotony which enters into its very texture.

Notes
...
It was stated by Professor Rhye, in the course of the controversy respects ing the so-called Welsh "Sineater" in the Academy (Nov., 1895). that the earliest dic- tionary form of "Diodlys" he had seen is "Diodlifft." At the time I attached no im- portance to the variant, thinking it a mis- print for the old long "s," but, in face of the above quotation from Chambers's Miscel- lany," I now half suspect that "lifft" may have been right, and that the Welsh word • "Diodlys" and the Scottish "Dishyloof" are corrupted variants of the same term, what- ever that may have been.

ere he learnt from his father, who showed him the utmost kindness and sympathy and acted throughout like a born gentleman, notwith- standing the wild escapades of his younger days, that his youngest son had completely lost his reason while in gaol, owing, so the physician asserted, to the dog-bites he suffered from when he entered. As he would be a harmless witling for the rest of bis life, the authorities gave him bis freedom, "whioh," he added with a sigh, "he has enjoyed by roaming about the country, a perfect ghost of his former self, living the life of a nomad, and performing the horrible functions of a Sin-eater, in which some Papist fools have encouraged him." Thus Hywel found himself after many weeks of feverish activity and terrible anxiety, his. body worn to a shadow, his mind harassed with the most unbearable uncer- tainty, his life-work at a standstill, and thou- sands of his fellow-countrymen crying for the light which he felt God had commissioned him to spread in every direction.

"They obeyed t.he Church, and only the Ohurch, and they argued tha,t, a.s a faithful son of the Church, its appointed Sin-Eater in the district, had practically sacrificed his earthy happiness to his zeal to win a convert, and had brought her to the Priory without using any force- in fact, without even touching her person- she was there for and they had no power to restore her to the world even if they wished."

Of course, my head was not always right until the dog's bite, and the prison doctor and the priest put it. But it is right now: I am atoning for ail my sins and my father's sinS and my grandfather's sins as a Sin-Eater. The people are begin- ning to know me, and they send for lie, though they are terribly afraid of me. I sit at a little stool by their doors, when they bring out their dMtd. and all eyes are on me. and everyone holds his breath in terror when I take the bread, off the breast of the corpse and eat it and drink the beer in the bowl they place on the bieT by its side, and their hairs sta.nd on tlid when I take the groait from the dead one's nearest relative. and say, with my face close to that of the corpse: 'I take thy sin8 upon my own soul; let thine rest at ease f°r ever, and let mine suffer its penalty.' And when the gipsy Prinoess dies, and when you, beautiful Nell. die, I shall take all your sins, and neither of your spirits will have to walk-" Oíh, Shon," she cried out, "you frighten me terribly! I do not understand you. Did you say that you came to take me home?" "Home? Oh, yea. Awd you must be there in safety until you die. Then I -wall come and eat your sins "Shon! I don't understand you; let me go home. No, no, I must take you. And I forgot; 1 mustn't torooh you, though I think I did just now. No, no. I must not touch yQu-at least, not urrtoil you are dead, than- I can go home quite well now, if you wÜI let me." N,L, no, follow me; I have a house and two horses over yonder. You will ride one botee and I the otther. And I will take you home. Yes, yes, home. But I mugt not touch you. Follow me, beautiful Nell." She was now perfoctAy aware that the poor fellow was thoroughly off his head. But, -though some of the strange things he said made her flesh creep, she w.as no longer afraid of him. She felt quite oecrtain he was not acting a part, and she made up her mind to humour him and follow him, so that by his aid she might get home and be out of clanger
