CHAP. III. 

Of following the Corps to the Grave , what it is an Emblem of: Of carry¬ng Greens in our Hand, what it signifies, what Use it may be of: Of Psalmody , its Antiquity , the Advantage and Use of it.

It hath been observed among all Nations, both in the Heathen and the Christian World, as a becoming and profitable Ceremony, to follow the Corps to the Grave. The Heathens observed it, [Precedenti pompa funebri, vivi fequuntur, tanquam haudmulto port morituri. *Al. ab. Alex. Lib. 3. P. 67.* Et *Pol. Vir, Lib. 6 . C. 10. P. 405.] because it presented to them, what would shortly follow, how they themselves should be so carried out, and laid down in the Grave. The going of the Corps before, shewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death ; and their following after, was as much as to say, that they must also in a short Time follow him thither. For this Reason the Chriftian also observes the Custom, and may, if he pleases, as he follows the Body to the Grave, entertain himself with a pious Meditation upon it, in such like Thoughts as these of the Pfalmift. 
*Thou art GOD from Everlasting , and World without End; Thou turnest Man to Destruction; again, Thou sayest , Come again ye Children of Men. For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday , seeing that is past as a Watch in the Night. As soon as thou scatterest them , they are even as a Sleep, and fade away suddenly like the Grass. In the Morning it is green and groweth up, but in the Evening it is cut down , dried up and withered. Do thou therefore , O LORD , let me know my End , and the Number of my Days , that I may be certified how long I have to live. Behold thou hast made my Days , as it were a Span long, and mine Age is nothing in respect of Thee;  and verily every Man living is altogether Vanity . And now, LORD, what is my Hope? Truly my Hope is even in Thee . Deliver me from all mine Offences, and O spare me a little that, I may recover my Strength, before I go hence and be no more seen*. Such Thoughts as these of our Friends, and of our own Mortality, would excite us to prepare for our own Change.

And as this Form of Procession is an Emblem of our dying shortly after our Friend, fo the carrying of Ivy, or Laurel, or Rosemary, or some of those Ever-Greens, is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality. It is as much as to say, That tho’ the Body be dead, yet the Soul is Ever-Green and always in Life: It is not like the Body, and those other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seafons, no *Autumn* nor *Winter* can make a Change in it, but it is unalterably the same, perpetually in Life, and never dying.

The *Romans*, and other Heathens upon this Occasion, made Use of Cypress, which being once cut, will never flourish nor grow any more, as an Emblem of their dying for ever, and being no more in Life. But instead of that, the ancient Christians used the Things before mentioned; they laid them under the Corps in the Grave, to signifie, that they who die in CHRIST, do not cease to live. For tho', as to the Body they die to the World ; yet, as to their Souls, they live to God.

And as the carrying of these Ever-Greens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality, so it is also of the Resurrection of the Body: for as these Herbs are not entirely pluck’d up, but only cut down, and will, at the returning Season, revive and spring up again; so the Body, like them, is but cut down for a while, and will rise and shoot up again at the Resurrection. For, as the Prophet *Isaiah* says, *Our Bones shall flourish like an Herb*.

* Haedera quoque vel laurus & hujufmodi, quse Temper fervant virorem, in iarchophago corpori fubiternuntur, ad fignificandum quod qui moriuntur in Chrifto, vivere nec ddinunt. Nam licet mundo moriantur fecundum corpus, tamen fecundum animam vivunt & revivifcimt Deo. Du¬ rand. Rit. Lib. 7. C. 35. de Ojfc . Mart* f Ifa. lxiii. 14. 

It was customary among the ancient *Jews*, as they returned from the Grave, to pluck up the Grass two or three Times, and then throw it behind them saying these Words of the Psalmist, *They shall flourish out of the City like Grass upon the Earth* : Which they did, to shew, that the Body, tho’ dead, should spring up again as the Grass. Thus by these two ancient Ceremonies, we have placed before our Eyes, our Mortality and Immortality; the one speaks the Death of the Body, the other the Life of the Soul, nay, and the Life of the Body too ) for like that Herb we carry, it is not quite pluck’d up, but fliall one Day be alive again. When it hath laid in the Earth the Whiter Season, the Continuance of this World, and the Warmth and Influence of the Spring is come, the joyful Spring of the Refurrection, it fliall be enliven’d, and shoot up, and eternally flourish. *For this Corruptible must put on Incorruption , and this Mortal must put on Immortality . O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave , where is thy Victory ! Thanks be to GOD, who giveth us the Victory through our LORD JESUS CHRIST.

There is another Custom used in Some Places, at the Procession of Funerals, which pays a due Honour to the Dead, and gives Comfort and Consolation to the Living and that is, the carrying out the Dead with Psalmody. This was an ancient Custom of the Church. For in fome of the earliest Ages, they carried out their Dead to the Grave with singing of Psalms and Hymns. Thus *Socrates* tells us, That when the Body of *Babylas* the Martyr was removed by the Order of *Julian* the Apostate, the Christians with their Women and Children, rejoyced and sung Psalms all the Way, as they bore the Corps from Dauphne to Antioch : Thus was *Paula* buried at *Bethlehem*, thus did St. *Anthony* bury *Paul* the Hermite; and thus were the Generality of Men buried after the three first Centuries, when Persecution ceased. In Imitation of this, it is still customary in several Parts of this Nation, to carry out the Dead with singing of Psalms and Hymns of Triumph to shew that they have ended their spiritual Warfare, that they have finished their Course with joy, and are become Conquerors which surely is a Matter of no little Consolation for the loosing of our Friend. And how becoming is it to pay such Honour to the Body! How is it imitating the blessed Angels, who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul, and carrying it to Heaven. For as they rejoyce *at her Conversion on Earth*, so most certainly they rejoyce at her going to Heaven. And as they rejoyce at the carrying of the Soul thither, so we, in Imitation of them, at the carrying out the Body to the Grave. They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin, we that the Body out of a World of Trouble; they that the Soul can sin no more, we that the Body can no more suffer; they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Happiness, we that the Body rests from its Labours.

When therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation, and this decent Ceremony is perform’d, let it also have a Share of our Thoughts, and excite in us Joy and Comfort, and Thanksgiving and Praise. And when these Customs are so observed, 'they will be of great Advantage to us, making us still fitter for the Heavenly Life. And surely a Thing of this Good and Profit, is much to be preferred to what hath in it nothing but Undecency and Irreverence sich is our laughing and jesting, and telling of News, when we accompany a Neighbour to the Grave. There is indeed a Mean to be observed, as in all other Things, so in this we must neither be too sad, nor too merry; we must not be so merry as to throw off all the Signs of Affection and Love, all the Tokens of Esteem and Humanity' nor must we *sorrow even as others , which have no Hope. But we must be so merry as to be able to sing Psalms , and so afflicted as to be excited to pray.
