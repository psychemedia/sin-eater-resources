# Missed Opportunities, Prior to 1830

Our story to date has tracked back through the sources originally identified from Mr. Matthew Moggridge's observations to the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, as well as the reports and queries that arose directly from that event.

These references include Hone's Year Book, 1831-32, the second edition of Leland's *Collectanea*, edited by Thomas Hearne and published in 1774, and various edition's of Brand's *Observations on the popular antiquities* as edited by Henry Ellis in a version dating back to 1813. All these sources draw ultimately on John Aubrey's manuscript, as well, perhaps as conversation with him, that can be found as part of the Lansdowne manuscripts held by the British Library.

In this chapter, we'll see whether there were any other popular, or at least, published sources that Moggridge might have overlooked, or been unaware of, that were published prior to his talk in September, 1852.

## Pennant's *Tours in Wales*

The first item worthy of note is [part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20141026214727/http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/text/5179.html) of *A Tour in Wales* by Thomas Pennant, first published i 1783 but recalling a tour from several years previously. The "Advertisement" at the front of the book is signed off by Downing on March 1st, 1781.

On page 338, we find the following reference to a funeral custom involving a food offering, drink and a payment made to a poor visitor:

> PREVIOUS to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they present, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and require the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that is done, all present kneel down; and the minister, if present, says the Lord's Prayer: after which, they proceed with the corpse; and at every cross-way, between the house and the church, they lay down the bier, kneel, and again repeat the Lord's Prayer; and do the same when they first enter the church-yard. It is also customary, in many places, to sing psalms on the way; by which the stillness of rural life is often broken into, in a manner finely productive of religious reflections.

This appears to be the offering of a dole, for there is no implication of the poor persons taking the sins of the deceased unto themselves.

On the previous page, page 337, is another custom that is worthy of remark:

> THE well of St. Aelian, a parish not far from Llandrillo in Caernarvonshire, has been in great repute for the cures of all diseases, by means of the intercession of the saint; who was first invoked by earnest prayers in the neighboring church. He was also applied to on less worthy occasions, and made the instrument of discovering thieves, and of recovering stolen goods. Some repair to him to imprecate their neighbors, and to request the saint to afflict with sudden death, or with some great misfortune, any persons who may have offended them. The belief in this is still strong; for three years have not elapsed since I was threatened by a fellow (who imagined I had injured him) with the vengeance of St. Aelian, and a journey to his well to curse me with effect.

In this case, it seems that prayers at to a holy well associated with St Aelian can be used to call forth a curse on one who has wronged the person uttering the imprecation. It's not clear what the process for "discovering thieves" is, but I am intrigued to find out.

## Bingley's *North Wales*

Next up comes William Bingley's *North Wales; including its scenery, antiquities, customs, and some sketches of its natural history, delineated from two excursions through all the interesting parts of that country, during the summers of 1798 and 1801.*, and published, in two volumes, in 1804.

In the [second volume](https://archive.org/details/northwalesinclud02bing/page/278/mode/2up), p279, as part of a section on the *The Manners and Customs of the Welsh*, Bingley also picks up on the ritual identified by Pennant of a wronged person calling on St Aeilian to curse someone who has wronged them:

> A strange custom prevails in some obscure parts of North Wales, which, however, the clergy have now almost abolished. This is termed the "offering of an enemy." When a person supposes himself highly injured by any one, he repairs to some church dedicated to a celebrated saint, or one who is believed to have great power over the affairs of men ; here kneeling on his bare knees before the altar, and offering a piece of money to the saint, he utters the most virulent and dreadful imprecations, calling down curses and misfortunes on the offender and his family even for generations to come. Sometimes the offended persons repair for the same purpose to some sacred well, dedicated to a saint. Mr. Pennant was threatened by a man, who fancied he had been injured by him, "with the vengeance of St. Elian, and a journey to his well, to curse him with effect." [Tour in Wales, ii. 337.]

```{admonition} A Tale of Saint Elian, Who Banned Greyhounds

So who was St Elian, and why was his well so potent?

According to [Celtic Remains](https://archive.org/details/celticremains00evangoog/page/162/mode/2up?q=elian) by Morris, Lewis, (*"transcribed from the original MSS. by me Richard Morris, son of the author's Brother, in the year of our Lord 1778"*), edited by D Silvan Evans, 1878, ([history](https://archive.org/details/sim_archaeologia-cambrensis_1872-01_3_9/page/36/mode/2up?q=celtic)), p161-2:

> By oral tradition. Elian had a young doe which he brought up tame, and the lord of that country gave his as much land to his church as the doe would encompass in a day. The tradition doth not say how the doe was drove to compass the ground; but it happened in her marking out her lord's ground that the greyhound of some rich man of the neighbourhood disturbed or killed the doe, upon which St. Elian in great wrath pronounced it a judgement on the inhabitants of the parich, that none of them should keep a greyhound to the end of the world; and his sentence is come to pass, for none of the parishioners are able to keep a greyhound — they areso very poor, the ground is so very rocky.

> " At a period when wolves were so formidable and numerous in Wales, Llewelyn the Great came to reside here for the hunting season, with his princess and children ; but while the family were one day absent, a wolf entered into the house and attempted to kill an infant that was left asleep in the cradle. The prince's favourite greyhound, called Gelert (given him by King John in 1205), that was watching by the side,, seized the rapacious animal and killed it, but in the struggle the cradle was overturned, and lay upon the wolf and child. On the prince's return, missing the infant, and observing the dog's mouth stained with blood, he immediately concluded Gelert had murdered the child, and in a paroxysm of rage drew his sword and ran the faithful animal through the heart ; but how great was his astonish- ment when, on replacing the cradle, he found the wolf dead and his child alive. He, however, caused the grateful creature to be honour- ably interred, and, as a monument to his memory, erected a church on the spot, as a grateful offering to God for the preservation of his child."

```

We note that Pennant's *Tour in Wales* is cited, but it is not clear from where the detail of the additional information, such as the phrase the "offering of the enemy", the kneeling ritual, and the monetary payment are sourced from.

On the previous page, a reference is made to a seemingly deep-seated belief that does not bear directly on the tradition of the "sin eater" as we have this far seen it described, but that does often appear in descriptions of Welsh folklore relating to funerals and death, *the corpse candle*:

> It is an opinion very prevalent within the diocese of St. David's in Pembrokeshire, that a short time previous to the death of a person, a light is some-times seen to proceed from the house, and even from the bed, and to pursue its way to the church where the body is to be interred, precisely in the same track that the funeral will afterwards follow. This light is call *canwyll corph*, or "the corpse candle."

A little further on, on p. 285-6, we see some more ingredients that resemble the sin-eater tradition, *almost*:

> A custom prevails in this country of each individual of the congregation making some *offering* in money on these occasions, which, if done in the church, is paid as a mark of respect to the clergyman. This custom, which is at present confined to North Wales, has doubtless been retained from the Romish religion, where the money was intended as a recompence to the priests for their trouble in singing mass for the soul of the deceased. In some cases, where the clergyman is not respected by his parishioners, the *offerings* are made on the coffin at the door of the house where the deceased resided, and are distributed amongst the poor relatives.

The tradition is associated with *North* Wales, and involves a payment supposedly made to a priest recalling payments made to "Romish" priests for services rendered in saying mass for a departed soul. However, where the disliked, the offering may be given to the poor, although again there seems to be no expectation of them taken the sins of the departed upon themselves. 

On the following pages, p287-8, we hear of another North Walian tradition:

> It is usual in several parts of North Wales, for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person, of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment ; and in some instances for weeding and adorning it, on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals, for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called *Diodlys*, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where at the same time the body is standing on a bier.

So here we have a payment to a poor person for a service rendered in terms of paying respects to the grave for the week following an interment. It is not clear from this fragment what the role played by the offerings — `yew, box, or other evergreens` – actually is.

The custom identified by Pennant then makes an appearance:

> It had its name from the custom, which is now discontinued, of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. — When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord's prayer ; after which they proceed with the body to the church. Four of the next of kin take the bier upon their shoulders ; a custom which is considered as expressive of the highest mark that even filial piety can pay to the deceased. If the distance from the house to the church be considerable, they are relieved by some of the congregation ; but they always take it again before they arrive at the church. — I have been informed that in some parts of the country it is usual to set the bier down at every cross-way, and again when they enter the church-yard, and at each of these places to repeat the Lord's prayer.

What we should take away from this, perhaps, is the word *Diodlys* as somehow referencing or describing elements of this tradition; and the apparent confusion over whether this tradition is to be found in North or South Wales.

## Jorevin's "Description of England and Ireland" in *The Antiquarian Repertory*

In [Volume II](https://archive.org/details/antiquarianreper02gros/page/n321/mode/2up?q=jorevin) of a "new edition" of *The Antiquarian repertory : a miscellaneous assemblage of topography, history, biography, customs, and manners ; intended to illustrate and preserve several valuable remains of old times* by Francis Grose and Thomas Astle, published in 1775, the authors quote widely from an account Mosnsieur Jorevin de Rocheford's 17th century travels in England, Ireland and Scotland.

On [p100-102](https://archive.org/details/antiquarianreper02gros/page/102/mode/2up?q=SCHROSBERY), Jorevin describes his travels through Shrewsbury, which includes an account of a funeral there. The account opens with a description of his intial thoughts on entering Shrewsbury:

> SCHROSBERY.
>
> The Severn is navigable to Schrosbery, I passed it over a large stone bridge,
at the entrance there is a suburb, the church of which appears to me to have formerly belonged to some fine abbey. I ascended from thence to the town, which is mounted on the platform of a rock, scarped on almost every side, which renders its situation naturally strong; besides which, the wall that encloses it made it difficult to be scaled ; the environs consist of large woods and high mountains, nevertheless this town is filled with people and rich shop-keepers, who dwell in two large streets, one leading to the market, place, and the other turning from this place towards the left. Near which are the Great Church, the Exchange, and Town-hall, they are in a street called Aystrit [High Street], which is so broad that it seems a long market-place, terminating at one of the ends of the town, where stands the Castle and commands it, being more elevated, and by so much the stronger as it is environed on one side by broad ditches, closed with good walls, and on the other there is no approach to it, on account of the steepness of the rock, but it has been ruined by the late wars, in so much that excepting a few towers and some lodgings within, I see nothing remarkable.

The account then describes a funeral ceremony he encountered; there is no particular mention of the pre-funereal rite, such as the sin-eating ceremony, although there does appear to be a tradition of placing jug of wine on the coffin from which everyone in attendance can drink the health of the deceased:

>I met nothing more pleasing to me than the funeral ceremonies at the interment of a My Lord, which mine host procured me the fight of. The relations and friends being assembled in the house of the defunct, the minister advanced into the middle of the chamber, where, before the company, he made a funeral oration, representing the great actions of the deceased, his virtues, his qualities, his titles of nobility, and those of the whole family, so that nothing more could be said towards consoling every one of the company for the great loss they had sustained in this man, and principally the relations who were seated round the dead body, and whom he assured that he was gone to heaven, the seat of all sorts of happiness, whereas the world that he had just left was replete with misery. It is to be remarked, that during this oration there stood upon the coffin a large pot of wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased, hoping that he might surmount the difficulties he had to encounter in his road to Paradise, where, by the mercy of God, he was about to enter, on which mercy they founded all their hope, without considering their evil life, their wicked religion, and that God is just.

The account then describes the funeral procession and interment:

> This being finished, six men took up the corps and carried it on their shoulders to the church ; it was covered with a large cloth, which the four nearest relations held each by a corner with one hand, and in the other carried a bough; the other relations and friends had in one hand a flambeau, and in the other a bough, marching thus through the street, without singing, or saying any prayer, till they came to the church, where having placed the body on tressels and taken off the cloth from the coffin, which is ordinarily made of fine walnut-tree, handsomely worked and ornamented with iron bandages, chafed in the manner of a buffet. The minister then ascended his pulpit, and every one being seated round about the coffin, which is placed in a kind of parade in the middle of the church, he read a portion of the Holy Scripture concerning the resurrection of the dead, and afterwards sang some psalms, to which all the company answered. After this he descended, having his bough in his hand like the rest of the congregation ; this he threw on the dead body when it was put into the grave, as did all the relations, extinguishing their flambeaus in the earth with which the corps was to be covered. This finished, every one retired to his home without farther ceremony, and I departed from Schrosbury for Chester, and having passed over a large desart plain, I reached Addar, Morton, and a Castle. The country here is barren ; passed a river near a windmill ; from thence to Pries and Vitechurch on a river. Here is a manufactory of woollen cloth. The road lies afterwards over some mountains, where are several good inns all alone ; Empost is one. Came to Anlai, and some small woods, having the river on the right, which runs to Chester.

## *Archaeological sketches of Ross and Archenfield*, 1821

If there is further evidence or anecdotes surrounding the existence of the sin-eater on the "Rosse highway", then an 1821 work entitled *Ariconensia, or, Archaeological sketches of Ross and Archenfield : illustrative of the campaigns of Caractacus, the station Ariconium, &c, with other matters never before published* by Thomas Dudley Fosbroke, is perhaps a good place to look, particularly if it includes *"other matters never before published"*.

Unfortunately, there is no new information, just a restatement of Aubrey's comments from the Lansdowne manuscripts via Popular Antiquities.

```{admonition} Aubrey Quoted via *Popular Antiq.* in *Archaological Sketches*
:class: dropdown
The quotation appears at [p72-4](https://archive.org/details/cu31924104094986/page/n89/mode/2up?q=singular).

> The following are matters which the author ascribes to the middle ages, at least he can assign no earlier date.
>
> The first is the singular custom, now obsolete, of *Sin-eating*.
>
> It appears, that so late as the seventeenth century, there was in the villages, adjoining to Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed; Ellis, the editor of the Popular Antiquities has extracted the following curious passage from the Lansdowne Manuscripts, concerning a *Sin-eater*, who "lived in a cottage, on Rosse highway."
>
> "In the county of Hereford was an old custom at Funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the house, and layd in the Biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the Corps, as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up] and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof lie took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old lawe, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22. " And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their: transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goate, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the Goate shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the Goate goe into the wilderness,"
>
> This custome (though rarely used in our day,) yet by some people was observed, even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the Parish) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her will; and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. [Popular Antiq. ii. 156.]

```

The fragment regarding sin-eating also appears on pp.222-3 of [*The Gentleman's Magazine 1822-03: Vol 92](https://archive.org/details/sim_gentlemans-magazine_1822-03_92/page/222/mode/2up), in a column on *Popular Customs and Superstitions in Herefordshore. [From Mr. Fosbroke's "Ariconensia."]*, p220-223, continued from earlier in that volume.

Although probably relevant to our story, there is also mention, again via Popular Antiquities, of a custom involving the casting of half-eater bread in the path of wedding party by a "deserted female":

> Formerly flowers were strewed before young couples, in their way to church. The author once saw a malicious caricature of this custom. Nosegays of rue enclosing a piece of half-eaten bread and butter were dropt in the church-path and porch by a deserted female, in order to denote an unhappy wedding. Stephens, in his plaine Country Bridegroom, p. 353, says "He shews neere affinity betwixt Marriage and Hanging ; and to that purpose, he provides a great Nosegay, and shakes hands with every one he meets, as if he were now preparing for a condemned man's voyage. [Popular Antiq. ii. 48]

In the hands of a storyteller, however, we might be able to weave a story that develops the notion of "half-eaten" bread, perhaps suggesting that not even a sin-eater would absolve the groom of the sin of spurning a woman he was perhaps previously betrothed to!

## Further Channelling of *Popular Antiquities*

In both the [*Morning Herald (London)*](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002408/18221102/016/0003) and the [*English Chronicle and Whitehall Evening Post*](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002631/18221102/018/0003) on Saturday, November 2nd, 1822, in a column on *"CUSTOMS AT DEATHS."*, several traditions are cited as coming from "*The Vulgar Errors* of Browne, with the interesting notes and additions of Mr. Ellis, recently published" but the text appears more correctly to come from Ellis' edited version of *Popular Antiquities*.

> The "Vulgar Errors" of Browne, with the interesting notes and additions of Mr. Ellis, recently published, furnish us with a curious detail of the various customs formerly observed at deaths, and several of which are yet retained in different parts of England. The article, as given in the work, is prolix, and contains some extraneous matter, which we think might have been omitted with advantage. In the following extracts we have selected only the parts most entertaining: they are ranged under several heads, as— "The Passing-Bell," "Watching The Dead," "Setting Salt or Candles on the Body," "The carrying of Torches and Lights," "Funeral Sermons," &c.

This sections all appear under the same name, and in related form, in *Popular Antiquities*.

```{admonition} The Passing Bell (or "Soul Bell")
:class: dropdown

> The PASSING BELL, so called from its denoting the passing or departing of any one from life to death, was originally intended to invite the prayers of the faithful for the person who was dying, but was not yet dead ; and though in some instances superstitiously used, has its meaning clearly pointed out in a clause in the "Advertisements for Due Order," &c. in the seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, which enjoins "that when anye Christian bode is *in passing*, that the *bell be toled*, and that the Curate be speciallie called for to comfort the sicke person ; and *after the time of his passing*, to ring no more but one short peale; and one before the buriall, and another short peale after the buriail." Grose, referring to the old Catholic belief on this subject, treats it rather ludicrously, though its intention, as just duscribed, was evidently serious. "The Passing Bell," says he, "was anciently rung for two purposes; one to bespeak the prayers of all good Christians for a soul just departing ; the other, to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the bed's foot, and about the house ready to seize their prey, or at least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage ; but by the ringing of that bell (for Durandus, a writer of the twelfth century, inform us evil spirits are much afraid of bells) they were kept aloof; and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start, or had what is; by sportsmen, called law."
>
> In the diary of Robert Birrel, preserved in "Fragments of Scottish History," &c. is the following curious entry :- "1566, the 25 of October, word came to the towne of Edinburghe, from the Queine, yat hir Majestie was deadly seike, and desirit ye bells to be runge, and all ye peopile to resort to ye Kirk to pray for her, for she was so seike that none lepsied her life" (expected her to live.) Bourne supposes, that from the saying mentioned by Bede, "Lord have mercy on my soul," which St. Oswald uttered when he fell to the earth, has been derived the distich so often introduced in ballads on the melancholy occasion of a coming execution:–
>
> "When the bell begins to toll, 
> LORD have mercy on my soul!"
> 
> In a very rare book entitled "Wits, Fits, and Fancies," (1614) the author relates a droll anecdote concerning the ringing out at the burial of "a rich churle and a begger who were buried at one time, in the same churchyard, and the bells rang out amaine for the miser. Now the wiseacre, his son, and executor," says he, "to the ende the worlde might not thinke that all that ringing was for the begger, but for his father, hyred a trumpetter to stand all the ringing while in the belfrie, and between every peak, to sound his trumpet, and proclame aloud and saye, sirres, this next peale is not for R, but for maister N,-,his father." There seems to be nothing more intended at present by tolling the Passing Bell, but to inform the neighbourhood of some person's death.
>
> The Jews used trumpets instead of bells. The Turks do not permit the use of them at all. The Greek Church under their dominion still follow her old custom of using wooden boards, or iron plates full of holes, which they hold in their hands and knock with a hammer or mallet, to call the people to church. China has been remarkably famous for its bells. Father Le Compte tells us, that at Pekin, there are seven bells, each of which weighs 120,000 lbs.

```{admonition} Watching With The Dead ("Wakes")
:class: dropdown

> WATCHING WITH THE DEAD.—This is called in the North of England the *Lake Wake*, a name plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon *lic* or *lice*, a corpse, and *waece* or *wake*, a vigil or watching. It is used, in this sense by Chaucer, in his "Knight's Tale :"
>
> "Shall not be told by me 
> How that arcite is brent to ashen cold, 
> Ne how that there the Liche-wake was y-hold 
> All that night long." 
>
> Pennant, in describing Highland ceremonies. says, "The Late Wake is a ceremony used at funerals. The evening after the death of any one, the relation or friends of the deceased meet at the house, attended by a bagpipe or fiddle, tbe nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting— that is, crying violently at the same time ; and this continues till daylght, but with such gambols and frolics among the younger part of the company, that the loss which occasions their meeting, is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corpse remain unburied for two nights, the same rites are renewed. Thus, Scythiau-like, they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery." The custom in North Wales, we are informed by the same writer, is, "the night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, bringing with them some small present, of bread, meat, and drink (if the family be something poor), but more especially candles, whatever the family be, and this night is called *wyl nos*, whereby the country people seem to mean a watching night. Their going to such a house, they say, is *i wilior corph*, to watch the corpse ; but *wylo* signifies to weep and, lament, and so *wyl nos* may be a night of lamentation. While they stay together on that night, they are either singing psalms, or reading some part of the Holy Scriptures. Whenever any body comes into a room where a dead body lies, especially on the *wyl nos*, and the day of its interment, the first thing he does, he falls on his. knees by the corpse and says the Lord's Prayer."
>
> The "Irish Hudibras" (1689) humorously describes an Irish wake—
>
> "To their own sports (the Masses ended) 
> The mourners now are recommended. 
> Some sit and chat, some laugh, some weep, 
> Some sing *cronans*, and some do sleep; 
> Some court, some scold, some blow, some puff, 
> Some take tobacco, some take snuff. 
> Some play the trump, some trot the hay, 
> Some at *machan* [a game of cards] , some noddy play:

```{admonition} Laying Out, or "Streeking"
:class: dropdown
> LAYING OUT, OR STREEKING THE BODY.— Durand, at the remote period at which he lived, gives a pretty exact account of some of the ceremonies used at laying out the body, as practised at pment in the north of England, where the laying out is called *streeking*. He mentions the closing of the eyes, the decent washing, dressing and wrapping up in a clean winding-sheet, or linen shroud, as well as other anciont observances. The interests of our woollen manufacture have interfered with this ancient rite in England. To the laying out may be added the very old custom of *setting salt*, and placing a lighted candle upon the body, both which are used to this day in some parts of Northumberland. The salt, a little of which is set in a pewter plate upon the corpse, is, according to the learned Morex, an emblem of eternity and immortality. It is not liable to putrefaction itself, and preserves other things that are seasoned with it from decay. The lighted candle, the same author conjectures to have been the Egyptian hieroglyphic for life. 
```

The extract also includes Aubrey's (now familiar to us) description of the sin-eater of the Ross highway:

> Aubrey, in some miscellanies of his, among the Lansdown MSS., at the British Museum, mentions a very curious custom at deaths, observed in a degree until his time (reign of Charles II), which he describes - under the name of *Sin-Eaters*. "In the County of Hereford," says he, "was an old custome at Funeralls, to hire poor people, who were to take upon-them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of theme (he was a long lean ugly lumentable raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layed on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl, of maple, full of beere (which lie was to drink up), and sixpence in money : in consideration he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the the sinnes of defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead." This custom, he supposes, had some allusion to the scape-goat under the Mosaical law.

Finally, we have a rather humourous story of the elegy given to an apparently renouned procuress, *Mother Creswell* in the mid-seventeenth century:

> FUNERAL SERMONS.— Speaking of the frequency of these formerly, and their present disuse :— "Even such a character as the infamous Mother *Creswell*, the procuress in the reign of Charles II," our author observes, "must have her Funeral Sermon." She, according to Granger, desired by will to have a sermon preached at her funeral, for which the preacher was to have 10l., but upon the express condition that he only spoke well of her. A preacher was with some difficulty found, who undertook the task. He, after a sermon preached on the general subject of morality, and the good uses to be made of it, concluded by saying— 'By the will of the deceased, it is expected I should mention her, and say nothing but what is *well* of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this :— she was born well, she lived well, and she died well, for she was born with the name of Creswell, she lived in Clerkenwell, and she died in Bridewell."

Just as another aside, there is an unpleasant tale that makes a passing reference to the famed Mother Cresswell, in [*"The Somers Collection of Tracts"*](https://archive.org/details/collectionofscar07someuoft/page/126/mode/2up?q=%22Mother+Cresswell%22+procuress)" (*A collection of scarce and valuable tracts, on the most interesting and entertaining subjects : but chiefly such as relate to the history and constitution of these Kingdoms, selected from an infinite number in print and manuscript, in the Royal, Cotton, Sion, and other public, ans well as private libraries, particularly that of the late Lord Somers. 2d ed.,*) by John Somers, second edition, revised and augmented by Walter Scott, Esq., 1812.

> *How the Seer Wareston `[Sir Archibald Johnston of Warristone, called Lord Warristone, was a stubborn presbytertan of the most rigid class. Yet he complied with Cromwell, under whose domination he retained his office of clerk register for Scotland. He was afterwards a leading member of the committee of public safety. He was apprehended at Rouen in France, after the Restoration, and delivered up to the English government, and, although his great age and the decay of his intellects, rendered him an unfit object of punishment, he was publicly executed 22d July, 1663]` lay with a Lady of Pleasure, that came to him with a Petition, upon the Council Table, and what happened thereupon.*
>
> Leave we now, Sir Lambert, a while, and let us rehearse what happen'd at the councel of safety, of which the Seer Warreston was chief president, who was a right notable knave, and exceeding salacious, as you shall understand by that which follows. There was a lady at that time, who had certain sad occasions to visit the councel of safety for the redress of certain grievances, but could never find a fit opportunity to deliver her supplication ; but at length finding that the Seer Warreston was all alone in the councel chamber, she prevail'd with money of the dore-keeper to let her in. When she came in, she appeared right comely unto the seer, and related her story unto him with such a grace, that he was straightway enamoured of her ; quoth he, 'Well do you deserve, fair lady, to have your petition granted, but should I grant you your petition, would you grant me mine ?' 'Alas!' said the lady, 'it is not for you to petition, who have so much power in your hands.' 'Ah !' replyed the seer, 'you have wounded me ; and I hope you will cure the wound which you have made,' and saying these words, he pulled her by the gown upon his knee, as he sate in his great chair, and would have kissed her. The lady, not ignorant how much coyness inflamed, made great resistance; but the more she resisted, the more was he on fire ; so that there was exceeding great contention and struggling between them ; at length the lustful seer being the stronger, had thrown her upon the councel table, and there laid her flat on her back, where at length she gave him leave to quench his desires with the spoils of her seeming chastity, on condition that he would grant her request. He had no sooner finished, but in came Sir Fleetwood the contemptible knight, and some others, who seeing the seer in a strange posture, with his band rumpled, his cap off, the sleeve of his gown torn, and his face more redder than ordinary, desired to know of him what had happened unto him. The seer not at all abashed, told them the whole story, who entered thereupon into great consultations among themselves. Some were of an opinion, that since the Seer Warestons genealogy was likely to increase, that the souldan should allow him a larger stipend. One stood up, and said it was requisite that the contemptible knight, and the knight of the allegories, should be sent to the temple of the gods, La potta del Papa Giovanna, to enquire of the oracle whether it were a boy or a girl, that provision for the birth and education might be made accordingly. Others were of opinion that 'twas convenient to know what his name should be. This debate took up above a weeks time, with continual pro's and con's, and at length they concluded that, if it were a boy, he should be called by the name of young Finbrandus, and that he should be sent to the enchanted castle Newgate, to be bred up in all the secrets of that place, by the several gyants that frequented the castle ; but if it were a girle, that she should be delivered to witch Creswellia [Mother Cresswell was an infamous procuress of the time], to be taught all kind of sorceries and enchantments ; and so the councel was dismist for that time.
