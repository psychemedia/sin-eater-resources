# The Twentieth Century Sin-Eater

In the years that followed the second controversy, references to the sin-eater started to fade away. An excpetion can be found in the pages of "Precious Bane", a novel by Mary Webb that appeared in 1924.

LIFE IN SHROPSHIRE, MRS WEBB'S NEW NOVEL By ROSE MACAULAY, 

" Precious Bane." By Mary Webb. Cape. 7s. 6d.

Mrs. Webb's new novel is a romance of Shropshire farm life of a century ago. The story is told by Prudence Sam, a farmer's daughter, who, besides being unfortunate in her appearance (she has a hare lip, and is never allowed to forget it), is unlucky indeed in her male relatives. Her father, whose custom it was on Sunday evenings to flog his children for forgetting the sermon, dies a violent death early in the story at the hands of his son, who inherits the farm, drives his mother and sister to labour like serfs in the field, and himself toils unceasingly to get rich. It is a tragic tale, for Gideon's pursuit of gold leads to the sacrifice of all he has held dear (including his sweetheart, whom he seduces and jilts, and his old mother, whom he poisons with foxglove tea) and finally to his own ruin.

The attraction of the story lies, however, not in Gideon's tragedy, nor in the love story of Prudence, but in its characteristically beautiful telling, and in its pictures of old country customsthe hiring fair, the harvest home, the midnight funeral, with its ancient rite of sin-eating, the rosemary and flaming torches flung into the grave, the tankard full of elderberry wine set on the coffin at the grave-side. 'Parson came forward and took it up, saying, 'I drink to the peace of him that's gone.' Then everybody came in turn, and drank good health to father's spirit."

Whether the funerals of Shropshire farmers in the early years of the 19th century were really like this, we do not know, and do not greatly care. Nor do we know if yokels of any period talked or wrote letters quite as these do; but this is a doubt inspired by the conversation of practically all yokels in fiction. And in this case all improbabilities are made natural by the fact that they are narrated as the memories of her youth by an old lady of small education. No one who has ever heard such old ladies relate past conversations will be surprised at Prue Barn's no doubt romantic embroiderings. In any case. all fiction about peasants is, for some reason, romantic. Mrs. Webb accepts this convention, but makes of it, as might be expected, a very poetic and charming book.

```

Most notable for the purposes of our tale is one chapter in particular (*Chapter 4: Torches and Rosemary*), where a funeral scene recounting the activities of a sin-eater is described. The phrase used by the sin-eater in taking on the souls of deceased in this purely fictional account is given as: _'I give easement and rest now to the, dear man. Come not down the lanes nor in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen.'_ Echoes of _"the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul"_ and of being _"freed from walking after they were dead"_ are both clear to see.

*See [](precious-bane-webb) for the text of the relevant chapter.*

In the mid-1930s, we also find a mention of a sin-eater character in the *Shields Daily News*.

The Wendy Hut column seems to have appeared in the Shields Daily News on [Monday, February 13th, 1933](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001168/19330213/126/0005), p5:

Turning to the children's section of the paper, on page 4 of the edition of [Tuesday, September 11th, 193](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002076/19340911/095/0004), we find the following rather saccharine tale:

```{admontion} Simon the Sin Eater

THE WENDY HUT
LONG AGO STORIES

SIMON THE SIN EATER.

Simon lived about a hundred years ago and he longed to travel to the far corners of the earth. His home was in the heart of the country where all the old customs were still kept up. and when old Farmer Brook died the whole village went to his funeral. When the ceremony was over, Farmer Brook's son asked if anybody would eat his father's sins, and he looked towards the beggars who were waiting for the dole of bread which was to he distributed in memory of the old farmer.

Now Simon knew that the farmer had been a good man, and before any of the beggars could come forward he ran up to the grave side and said he would be sin-eater. His father was horrified, but Simon ate the slice bread which was supposed to contain all the farmer's sins, and was given a shilling.

"His sins cannot harm me," said Simon when his father thrashed him. "I'm not sure that they could really get into the bread."

When Simon attended another funeral and ate the sins afterwards, his parents decided that nothing could be done with such a boy who became known as Simon the Sin-eater.

"I am no worse for eating them," thought Simon, "and I am collecting money to go to London."

By the time he was eighteen he had eaten so many sins that people would not have him in their homes. The girls, and even the young men, were afraid of him, and the old folk said he was very wicked.

"Perhaps I am," though Simon. "I will eat no more, but I will try to make atonement for the sins of all those whose bread I ate."

So he travelled to London, saw all the sights of the great city, and wondered what he should do to make atonement. He was gentle and kind, and people liked his serious face. One day when he was down at the docks he saw a transportation ship, sailing to Australia with gangs of convicts chained together, and he was horrified.

"Is there anybody to look after the souls of those poor men?" he asked the captain.

"No," was the reply. "They are all wicked and richly deserve their punishment."

"Perhaps they could be improved," said Simon. "I have eaten sins since I was fourteen, and now I will atone for them if you will take me on board and let me help these wretched men."

"If you can prevent them from fighting and breaking up the ship, you will be well worth your keep," smiled the captain. "Come and try. At least you have a good and beautiful face!"

So Simon went, and by the time he had made three voyages everybody travelling to Australia had heard of Simon the Missionary, the man who did good. All his life he worked among the convict settlers of Australia and was loved and honoured in his new land.

```

Thus far, I haven't been able to find any other reference to "Simon the Missionary", and the tale does rather take the form of a parable that might be used as the basis for a children's sermon. For example, Simon as a child seems unconcerned that the sins could actually be transferred to him, although the rest of society *does* start treat him as a pariah. On reaching adulthood, he stops the practice that so offended his peers, accepting, perhaps, that he had been transgressing in some way, and seeing fit to then redeem himself by the proxy of atone for the sins of others that he had taken on himself. Do we read this as Simon falling in with a bad lot, being led by others, believing "but *I'm" not doing anything wrong", then perhaps realising his bad ways and deciding to help others less fortunate than himself — _"there but for the grace of God go I?"_ — redeeming not what he perceived as his own indiscretions, necessarily, presumably believing himself to be essentially good at heart, but those who had led him astray?

In recent years, the sin-eater tradition has appeared in several literary works, including and ["The Sin Eater"](https://www.megancampisi.com/sin-eater) by Megan Campisi, 2022 [[interview](https://www.panmacmillan.com/blogs/fiction/megan-campisi-on-the-sin-eater)]
