# An Aside — The Founding of the Folk_lore Society

In the *Saturday Review* of February 5th, 1876, an article appeared commenting on a new initiative by the editor of a provincial newspaper to encourage their local readers to send in collected examples of local folk-lore before it was lost and forgotten:

THE DECAY OF RURAL TRADITION.

The editor of a Worcestershire newspaper has invited co-operation throughout that county in an experiment which is so excellent in its aim that it ought to be a success, and at the same time so late in its beginning that it must prove, it is to be feared, more or less of a failure. It is proposed to collect, under the title of "Old Worcestershire," the floating and unwritten, or at least unpublished, treasures of local traditions, customs, legends, proverbs, rhymes, and miscellaneous fireside memories belonging to the county; and, with a wise forethought, all such matter not belonging to the county is distinctly excluded from the plan. Such a work would stand in the same relation to the ordinary county histories as Mr. Green's *History of the English People* does to the ordinary Histories of England; and, if efficiently executed, it would go far to clothe the dry bones of the antiquary's labours with living flesh and blood. To the average antiquary of a century it does not appear to have been matter of much concern whether, if a man had not a coat of arms, he had any sort of coat at all. The only characteristic worthy of notice was a crest; and he who did not exhibit a motto might just as well not belong to the race of articulately speaking men. Exceptions were indeed made in favour of such departed worth as might have attained the parochial beatification of a monument; but then it must be in the church itself, and not in company with " the rude forefathers of the hamlet" in the churchyard.

It is, however, only just to Worcestershire men to say that Dr. Nash, the historian of that county, was an autiquary and an observer of a much higher type. His " collections" are full of interesting detail upon matters quite outside the range of the Heralds' College; and the curious old ballad in praise of Malvern and its waters, with its pious refrain, "O praise the Lord," in every verse, is known best, if not exclusively, through his volumes. His search of ancient records kept in view the man as well as his " coat," as in the case of the first known rector of the important parish of Martley :—" Robertus de Lech, persona de Mertle, per fas et nefas ab adolescentié sua nummorum numerum augmentavit, et ille avarus 4 Id. Aprilis (1299) predonibus peremptus pecuniam perdidit atque vitam. functi funus non patria, vir dolet unus." The reference for this pleasant obituary notice is to " Ann. Wig." (i.e. *Annales Wigornienses*). But even the county historian of wider aims, such as Dr. Nash, would not have considered it worth his while, or of interest to his readers, to collect the old stories and superstitions of the country side. They probably showed, in the later years of the eighteenth century, no sign of dying out, and no Commission or Department had as yet been invented for the express purpose of making war against them. Learned men might correspond with each other on the subject of amazing derivations for local names; but they did not trouble themselves to know why or whether an anxious mother would come to the parson to beg a "Sacrament shilling " to hang round the baby's neck as " good for fits," or the old grandmother, when a thunderstorm was approaching, go to her chest for the " Letter of Our Saviour to King Abgarus," that she might fasten it up on the wall. If the language of old goodwives and nurses now and then reached the ears of wigged authority, it was probably disposed of after the fashion of Dr. Johnson :—" It is observable that the nurses call sleep by, by; lullaby is therefore Judi to sleep." Why "the nurses call sleep by, by" did not concern our great-grandfathers very much.

Such an inquiry as that which has been lately set on foot in *Berrow's Worcester Journal*, and which has been taken up with some interest in a part of the county, might help to solve several age of general historical interest. Among others, it would probably throw some curious light upon that chronological puzzle which everybody finds it so easy to answer wrong— the date of the Reformation. Rural England might be found not altogether to have borne out the favourite theory of the short and easy manuals, that the religious life of the people was at a certain fixed time, by order from London, turned upside down and emptied out like a drawer in a house-cleaning, and then, after being carefully scrubbed and aired, filled up again with duly authorized contents. There would seem to have remained a good many odds and ends in the corners, suggesting that the contents of the drawer had been subjected to a very different process of change. And not a few shreds and bits of broken material would extend the suggestion to an earlier date, in the the change from Pagan to Christian worship, and indicate in various charms and superstitions that the old gods, like the Canaanites, held their ground in many a hill fastness for a long time after the general conquest of their land. But during the last half-century, and especially during the present reign, the process of house-cleaning has been going on throughout the country in a very businesslike and unsentimental fashion ; and a millenium of English rural life would seem to be approaching, or at least yearned after, in which the old home, swept and purified from the accumulated "rubbish" of ages, with its dear familiar fragrance of rose-leaves and lavender, but qualified, it must be allowed, with some flavour of mildew and old leather, shall shine forth in perfect uniformity of design from Berwick to St. Michael's Mount, radiant in whitewash and odorous with yellow soap.

It is certain that, with our great and advancing social changes, the old memories and traditions have been disappearing fast. Our Sibyl, with her volumes of local history, is repeating the experience of her prophetic predecessor. The reason is not far to seek. Let any one plunge into the depth of even a moderately remote country district, such, for instance, as that which lies beneath him from Malvern to the West and North-west, and, eschewing every highway with a trace of Macadam about it, search out the ancient ways to which old maps or his own eyes may guide him—the main lines of packhorse communication or the cross-roads which led to market. He will probably soon discover, when his path touches some modern road, a wooden receptacle resembling half a Noah's Ark, nailed on a gate-post or hung in a tree; and he will rightly divine that this is meant for a rustic post-office. Let him, after the first inevitable smile at the ways of a primitive people, carry back his thought to their life in the days before this " scent " of the world's " paper-chase " was laid there, and when their only roads were the old tracks which he has been following. The people certainly could not write. For the most part, they could not read either; if they could, the Bible and Prayer-Book, and the broadsheets of carols or of songs from the pack of the infrequent pedlar, made up the bulk of their available literature; while wonderful prescriptions for the cure of rheumatism or of the stone might be found preserved in quaint MS. on a fly-leaf in the singing-gallery. After the day's labour, by the farm kitchen fire, in the summer twilight or the long winter evening, almost their only mental and intellectual resource would lie in telling over the old stories and sayings, and in singing the old ballads and rhymes. Such education as there was current would run in the same grooves. The baby must be sung to sleep; the restless or fractious child must be soothed by a story; the dame would teach the carol which she knew, and the prayer which she herself had once learnt. Thus the traditions remained, and, which is of still more importance, traditionary legends received uncriticizing belief. The parish clerk, a corporation sole, was their ordinary trustee; and the self-elective hierarchy of village singers in the larger parishes kept up the succession of ballads and graver tunes.

Another element in rural life and society had an important influence on the preservation of this unwritten literature. Mr. Hughes was, we think, the first to point out, in *Tom Brown*, that the *vates sacer* of the hall and the rectory had ceased, or is ceasing, to perform his once established function of learning in his boyhood and preserving in his later years the traditions of his home neighbourhood. He had not in the old days become the cosmopolitan that he is now; his early interests were very much confined to the narrow circle of his home; and the stories which he picked up in the nursery and the village were retained in a mind more intelligent than those of nurses and labourers, if not equally credulous. The existing condition of our social system through all its grades is fatal to the maintenance of such a state of things. Oral traditions are dying out, and those which have not already been preserved, or which cannot now be collected, in books must gradually cease to be. It is not within our present purpose to comment on the social or moral aspects of this change, with the causes and progress of which alone we are concerned. It is needless also to do more than refer to the altered conditions and opportunities of popular knowledge, and to the increased mental supplies for even the most uneducated modern labourer, which will have been sufficiently indicated by contrast with the condition already described. As a consequence of these, however, it is plain that the old local legends and traditions are no longer believed. Older people who may have heard them in their childhood are either ashamed of them or do not care to repeat them; and, though they may occasionally be extracted by careful cross-examination, the very process implies that their heads must already have been set down in the questioner's brief.

The school and the clergyman together have done a great deal, partly of deliberate purpose and partly by indirect action, to banish the old carols and the miscellaneous local rhymes or doggrel from the storehouse of childish memory. In a neighbourhood where, not forty years ago, every village child, when asked as to his or her prayers, would reply, " I says ' Our Father,' and 'I believe,' and ' Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,'" not a single child, in a school specially questioned for the purpose, was found to be acquainted even with the name of the old Angelo-Evangelistic invocation. The combined efforts of two or three educated memories may perhaps recover the whole of the curious " Catharine and Clement" rhymes associated in West Worcestershire with the children's custém of begging for apples in the last week of November ; but the legendary fame of St. Catharine has almost entirely died out of remembrance in the Teme-valley district, where fifty years since it continued in undiminished freshness. The tracks of the Saint's " Mare and Colt," and of the iron patten-rings of the " maid" who stole them, may be found still by the curious upon blocks of the Old Red Sandstone lying in the devious course of the brooks (and of their tributary rills as well), down which the animals were led to avoid detection; but probably there is not an inhabitant of the district now living who would not laugh at the belief which was firmly held there in the early part of the present century. Drainage has disposed of the Will-o-the-Wisp who was known as a contemporary in the same region; and the rural policeman (*vice* the parson, withdrawn) has effectually laid the ghosts. It is therefore without much anticipation of any large measure of success that we offer a hearty welcome to the proposal lately issued by our Worcester contemporary, and express our hope that all who are able to sist in carrying it out will co-operate in furnishing the materials, Every year will make the work less susceptible of efficient performance. It should be remembered, however, that a record of ancient local customs and traditions is not the same thing as a miscellany of recent "facetiae " and personal gossip; while, for want of the better material, a tendency to supply the inferior may very naturally be looked for. The promoters of the "Old Worcestershire " collection have evidently been aware of this probability ; and the column now published weekly is a mere gathering of rough material, to be sorted and silted at a future time, for the purposes of the ultimate publication.

Posterity will no doubt acknowledge the large debt of gratitude which it owes to the Education Department, the Training Colleges, and perhaps even to Spelling Bees and the *Daily Telegraph*, for the spread of that higher enlightenment which, from its centres in the towns, has illumined the depths of remote valleys in the rural districts. At the same time posterity will not forget that the certificated schoolmaster, "abroad " in the company of the penny journalist, has done a great deal with his high-polite English to destroy the old grammatical and philological landmerks of his countrymen. It would be too much to ask of her Majesty's Inspectors that they should require school managers, Boards, and teachers to preserve for future reference a collection of all the local phrases, " vulgarisms," and disallowed pronunciations which they have banished from their " Standards" throughout the land; but the volunteer chiffonniers who would endeavour thus to collect the sweepings cast outside the school premises might comfort themselves with the hope that their labours will not be unrecognized a hundred years hence. The collector even of " old wives' fables," of local superstitions, and other waiis and strays of an imperfectly educated past, may encourage himself in the same hope. The legends and traditions of the English people are at least of no smaller interest than those old memorials of the Hellenic race which give so vivid and abiding an interest to the first volume of Grote's *History of Greece*.

A week later, in the February 12th, 1876, edition of *Notes & Queries*, [Vol 5, Iss 111](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-02-12_5_111/page/124/mode/2up), p124, a note appeared entitled _"A Folk-Lore Society"_:

> I am not alone in thinking it high time that steps should be taken to form a society for collecting, arranging, and printing all the scattered bits of folk-lore which read of in books and hear of in the flesh. Such a society should not confine its labours to the folk-lore of our own land, but should have members and workers everywhere.  
> ST. SWITHIN.

Whether or not the Morning Review article had prompted that not, or a discussion that led correspondent St Swithin to write that letter, we may never know. But following a resounding silence in the pages of *Notes & Queries* in the issues immediately following St Switihin's suggestion, another correspondent did reply a couple of months later in the April 4th, 1876, edition, [Vol 5, Iss 119](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-04-08_5_119/page/294/mode/2up), p294, offering their wholehearted support to St. Swithin's suggestion, and citing the earlier article in the *Saturday Review*:

> A Folk-Lore Society (5 s. v. 124.)— May I call the attention of St. Swithin and others to the following suggestions? "The Decay of Rural Tradition " is the title of an article in the Saturday Review for Feb. 5, 1876, in which it is stated that the editor of a Worcestershire newspaper has invited co-operation throughout that county in an experiment to collect "the floating and unwritten, or at least unpublished, treasures of local traditions, customs, legends, proverbs, rhymes, and miscellaneous fireside memories belonging to the county." The idea is so excellent that I wish it every success. My object in referring to the subject here is to hope that the same thing may be done in every county, and that the collections may include writings in various dialects, lists of locally-printed books (many of which never reach Bloomsbury), of all the works, small as well as great, relating to the county, of local worthies, and of authors, celebrated and comparatively unknown, born within the county. As copies of all our newspapers are preserved at the British Museum, the collections would soon prove of great value to the antiquary, and a thousand waifs and strays, that would not find admission even to the pages of "N. & Q.," be preserved. The schoolmaster who laughs at old traditions, and the railway that is rapidly mixing the population of the country, are sad destroyers of our local legends. Who, then, of newspaper editors will come to the rescue by opening their columns for this purpose, say, on one particular Saturday of the month? and who of clergymen, doctors, and antiquaries will take the trouble to seek for and write down such folk-lore as may yet be found lingering in our less-enlightened districts ? H. Bower.

Another couple of months passed by before the next response, in the June 3rd, 1876 edition, [Vol 5 Iss 127](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-06-03_5_127/page/456/mode/2up), p457, pointed out that several newspapers had already been engaging with the collection of local folk-lore for serval years:

> A Folk-Lore Society (5th S. v. 124, 294.)— The suggestions of Mr. Bower at the latter reference are being carried out, and have been worked with great success for some years, in the Midlands, and a great deal of matter of interest has been collected. Some six or seven years ago a Birmingham newspaper (I forget which) began to collect old lore. This was followed by a Chesterfield paper, *The Derbyshire Times*, which, under the special editorship of a well-known contributor to "N. & Q.," published weekly for several years from one to three cols. of valuable and interesting matter, under the heading of " Local Notes and Queries." This form of "news" was soon imitated by neighbouring papers, with pretty fair success on the whole. Amongst the papers which continue to collect from their readers under this heading I may name the *Manchester Guardian*, the *Sheffield and Rotherham Independent*, the *Bradford Observer*, and three Derby papers — the *Reporter*, *Advertiser*, and *Mercury*. Several Cheshire newspapers publish antiquarian notes, and the *North of England Advertiser* a short time ago made this kind of reading a principal feature in its weekly issue.

A month later, a certain "Old Folklorist" replied in the July 1st, 1876 edition, [Vol 6 Iss 131](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-07-01_6_131/page/12/mode/2up), p12, supportive of St Swithin's suggestion, but despairing that it didnlt appear to have received any support otherwise:

> A Folk-Lore Society (5th S. v. 124, 294, 457.) — Hailing as I do with great satisfaction the excellent suggestion of your accomplished correspondent St. Swithin (5th S. v. 124), I must admit that I have been greatly disappointed that that proposal has not elicited greater support from your readers.

We also get a clue as to the identity of the correpsondent, someone who had been interested in the idea of folk-lore thirty years previously, in the mid 1840s...

> As one who suggested upwards of thirty years ago the advisability of collecting the remains of our popular mythology and superstitions before they were quite trampled out by the iron horse, and who has never ceased to take an interest in the subject, I venture to say that not a day should be lost in organizing such a society.

The correspondent also seems to been mindful of the expense, as well as the practicalities, of engaging in such an enterprise:

> A central committee in London, of some half dozen who have made Folk-Lore more or less a study, with local secretaries in different parts of the country, if backed by a couple of hundred subscribers of a guinea, might collect and print an interesting yearly volume.
> 
> Judging from what I have seen in some local newspapers, one of the committee's greatest difficulties would be not that of collecting, but that of selecting what is not already recorded by Brand and his editors, Sir Henry Ellis and Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps. This would require to be done with considerable judgment, and with great care, so as not to discourage those who take the trouble to communicate what they believe to be not generally known.

He (the correspondent is presumably a he), also appears to value the contributions that women would be able to offer to such a society:

> Ladies should be specially invited to take part in the work, who, in their kindly ministrations in the cottages of their poorer neighbours, must often come across traces of old world customs and beliefs.

The importance of keeping momentum up is also suggested:

> Though I have spoken of an annual volume, I would not wait for the completion of a volume, but keep alive interest in the Society by issuing a few sheets from time to time, as soon as sufficient materials of interest had been collected. Success to the Folk-Lore Society !
>
> An Old Folk-Lorist.

In the edition of 8th July, 1876, [Vol 6 Iss 132](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-07-08_6_132/page/36/mode/2up), the previous week's letter appears to have prompted two further responses, to Mr. Ratcliffe's note, the first, at p37, in the form of a correction:

> A Folk-Lore Society (5th S, v. 124, 294, 457 vi. 12.)—  
> Mr. RATCLIFFE has mistaken (p. 457) the name of the newspaper in this district which makes "antiquarian notes," &c., "a principal feature in its weekly issue." It is the *Newcastle Weekly Chronicle*, and not the paper he mentions, that Mr. Ratcliffe must have had in his mind. The " Notes and "Queries " of the *Weekly Chronicle* were commenced about three years ago.
> Ernest WELLS.
> Newcastle-on-Tyne.

and the second, identifying another local source of notes, as well as being supportive of the mooted society:

> The *Glasgow Weekly Herald* has a correspondents' column, wherein not infrequently bits of folk-lore crop up among the "Questions, Answers and Memoranda." I thoroughly agree with your correspondents that Folk-Lore Society is now become almost a necessity, and hope sincerely that the project may not be allowed to ground, but that we may very soon have an energetic and useful Society. A great field lies still open for cultivation ; and I have little doubt but that when the scheme is thoroughly ventilated, there will be no lack of the needful members to support and carry out its aims. The proposal of St. SWITHIN is an opportune one, and with able men to guide the Society we need not fear any failure.

Vol 6 Iss 135 p90-1
A Folk-Lore Society (5th S. v. 124, 294, 457 ; vi. 12, 37.) —"Every dog has his day," and as this (July 15) is St. Swithin's, I think I am justified in regarding it as my most favourable opportunity for saying a little more about the proposed Folk-Lore Society.

The countenance An Old Folk-Lorist gives to the scheme is very encouraging ; I am grateful for it, though he and I differ essentially as to the object the Society should have in view. This, with him, should be the printing of such items of folk-lore as have not been "already recorded by Brand and his editors, Sir Henry Ellis and Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps"; with me, the gathering together of all folk-lore, whether English or foreign, whether known to Brand or, if I may say so, brand-new to literature, the classifying of the materials, and the publication of the result in instalments, with as much learned note and comment as may be obtainable.

In this way only, I venture to think, could the Society materially help on the study of comparative folk-lore, or work with full benefit in other respects to those interested in its existence. I do not see why we should cast a slight on Dr. Brown, F.S.A., and the Rev. — Jones (both of whom have published works on folk-lore) by accounting certain items of their carefully chronicled collections as "unrecorded," merely because Brand and his editors lacked information of which Messrs. Brown and Jones have become possessed. The English Dialect Society carries on its investigations on the strength of half-guineas ; may not the Folk-Lore Society hope to do the same, and thereby secure many supporters, who might hold aloof in these "hard times" if membership involved the payment of a higher sum ?

I quite agree with An Old Folk-Lorist " that not a day should be lost in organizing" the Society; and I believe he and many others will agree with me that some important position therein should be offered to the original Folk-lorist of the Atheneum, the ex-editor of the "learned, chatty, useful " periodical in which the present scheme was mooted, Mr. William J. Thoms. Is it too much to ask him to take some active preliminary steps in the cause— to play the grandfather to the bantling of his own offspring, "N. & Q."?) St. Swithin.

****

I concur with several correspondents of "N. & Q." that no time should be allowed to be lost in establishing this society. A special department might be constituted for the collection and recording of Celtic folk-lore, the superstitious beliefs and practices and the other popular lore of Ireland, Wales, the Scottish Highlands, and Man, —items which are interesting from their distinctive character, and the more urgently in need of preservation because associated in most cases with perishing vernacular tongues. In connexion with the useful list given by Mr. Ratcliffe, and continued by others, it may be mentioned that several Highland publications devote space to the subject of folk-lore, e.g. the *Inverness Courier*, the *Highlander*, and the *Celtic Magazine* (Inverness, A. & W. Mackenzie) ; and that the Gaelic Society of Inverness have appointed a folk-lore committee. Some interesting contributions to the subject were contained in the *Gaidheal*, a magazine published by Messrs. Nicolson, of Glasgow. It is now, I fear, extinct, and as I have received no reply to a communication addressed to the publishers, I presume certain back numbers which I require cannot be supplied by them. Should the work be in the hands of any reader of " N. & Q.," he would confer a favour by lending the numbers in question (June, 1873 ; June, 1874; August, 1874; all previous to November, 1872, and all subsequent to September, 1874), or any of them, for inspection, or, if preferred, I should be glad to purchase them.

Welsh folk-lore finds a home in the columns of the *Oswestry Advertiser* (from which it is reprinted as " Bye-gones relating to Wales and the Border Counties"), in the *Cambrian News*, and, I believe, in other newspapers of the Principality. It is significant, as an illustration of the position occupied at present by Ireland as regards matters literary, that that country—so singularly rich in monuments of the past of every description, whether in the ruins and ancient remains meeting the traveller on all hands or in the beliefs and usages which have come down from a period beyond history — has not, so far as I am aware, a single newspaper or other weekly or daily publication which concerns itself with Irish folk-lore. Apart from any other consideration, it seems strange that the managers of Irish newspapers do not recognize the increased interest which they would lend to their respective journals, and the possibility of increased circulation, by opening a folk-lore column.

Scraps

A FOLK-LORE SOCIETY, the formation of which has been under discussion for some time past in Notes and Queries, is now definitely proposed by Mr. William J. Thoms, who suggests the following points as a basis. – That the headquarters of the Society must be in London, and that there should be a yearly subscription of 1l. 1s. Regarding the first suggestion, Mr. Thoms writes: "I insist on this because the Folk Lore Society must not only have a local habitation and a name, but that habitation must be central and permanent," and as to the second he very naturally says that from the very motives of the Society the incidental expenses will be large, apart from the paper and printing ; and paper and print are luxuries which must be paid for. Mr. Thoms proposes that one of the duties of the Society will be to gather in the various local journals which indulge in folk-lore columns, and to mount and preserve these columns for future use, and, next to gathering together the relics of our folk-lore, the collecting of analogous folk-lore of other countries. The more important items of their researches would be published in an annual volume. Mr. G. Laurence Gomme, whose name is familiar to readers of Notes and Queuries, has consented to act as Honorary Searetary, and any lady or gentleman (for, remarks Mr. Thom, the Folk-Lore Society is one which may be greatly promoted by ladies) who may be disposed, is requested to communicate his orher intentions to that gentleman, at 26, Merthyr Terrace, Castelnau, Barnes, S. W.

Folk-lore.

A "Folk-lore Society" has been formed for the purpose of preserving the fast-fading relics of our popular fictions and traditions, legendary ballads, local proverbial sayings, superstitions, and old customs. According to the prospectus, the new society "will gather together the folk-lore articles scattered throughout English literature, and such communications the same subject as may be forwarded direct to the society, and select therefrom articles of special interest for publication by the society; and, as opportunities offer, it will print the folk-lore of the colonies and also of other countries may serve to illustrate and explain that of our own. As the society increases and its means further develop, it is intended to extend the field of its labours, so as to include the collection and publication of the the folk-lore of aboriginal peoples." Among the members of the council are Mr. F. Ouvry (president of the Society of Antiquaries), Professor Max Müller, Mr. W. R. S. Ralston, M.A., and Mr. Edward Solly, F.R.S. Mr. Thoms has consented to act as director of the society.

Echoes of the Week

All those who are interested in popular legends, antique traditions, superstitions, nursery rhymes, old-fangled proverbs, and familiar locutions, quaint manners and customs, and, indeed, in all that goes the generic name of "folklore,"- will rejoice to hear that the originator of the term, the veteran Mr. J. W. Thoms, whilom Editor of *Notes and Queries* and librarian of the House of Lords, is busy organising a "Folk-Lore Society," the head-quarters of which are to be in London, and the subscription to which is to be a pound a year. I would rather that the subscription were guinea. The extra shilling is not missed; "little fishes eat sweet;" and what says the old song ?— "I'd rather have guinea than one-pound note." The object of the Folk-Lore Society (of which I am glad to see that ladies as well as gentlemen are to be eligible members) will be to collect, store-up, and publish accounts of all manner of curious, out-of-the-way oldwives erudition. Mr. G. Laurence Gomme is to be Honorary Secretary of the Society, which I shall hasten to join— if they will receive me. I have that within me which passeth show in the matter of folk lore; and I burn to unburden myself. I want to prove my favourite theories that Old Daddy Longlegs was Lollard or Wykliffite parson who declined to read the liturgy in Latin ; that Jack Sprat and his wife-were Empson and Dudley; and I have some surprising developments to make public concerning Dickens's dishes and Meg's Diversion.
