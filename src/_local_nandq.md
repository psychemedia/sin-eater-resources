LOCAL "NOTES AND QUERIES."

*To the Editor of the Birmingham Journal*.  
Sir,—I have often thought, especially lately, in the interesting sketches of our good old town in your Wednesday's paper, how useful column of local "Notes and Queries" would be. There are many men now living who could give much valuable information about the social, political, and industrial history of the town during the last half century. Many old men are the only depositories of this local knowledge, and when they depart, it will become mere tradition. I see your venerable contemporary, the *Gazette*, is about to open its columns for antiquarian or probably ecclesiatical notes and queries; and as I do not often see that paper, and am more interested in general matters, it has occurred to me that you might have half column in tour Wednesday's paper for general notes and queries about local matters. I cannot promise to contribute to the "notes," I fear, but shall probably be a troublesome correspondent as far as the "queries" are concerned. For example, in a late chapter of his history the writer spoke of the "sword presented to Colonel Wallace" for refusing to fire on the people here. Now an old triend of mine says believes that the gallant Colonel declined any testimonial, and that the amount collected was given to the charities of the town. Is this so? What are the real facts of the case? Scores of people here must know; and surely none would grudge ten minutes to give, in the suggested column, a satisfactory reply.

I am. Sir, your obedient servant, ENQUIRER.

[We shall happy be to open the columns of our Wednesday's paper to such subjects. interesting criticism on the remarks offered in the "Literary Leader" of Wednesday last, on the text of Shakspeare, will be a fitting commencement of this department of our paper. Ed. Journal.

LITERATURE, SCIENCE AND ART

Our readers will observe in another part of this day's paper the commencement of a weekly portion devoted local "Notes aud Queries." The importance of the object needs no explanation and no defence. We confess we did contemplate some such corner some months ago, but the insertion of this series of articles in some degree interfered with the proposal, and we thought no more of it umtil reminded of the matter in by a letter last week. We hope that any of the readers of this column who can contribute any note, however brief, illustrative of the manners and customs of Birmingham or its vicinity in earlier days, who can explain any difficulty, clear away any doubt, or throw any light on our local history, will be glad do so as often and briefly as they can.

QUERIES.

Sir,—I am glad you have so readily adopted my suggestion for a column of local Notes and Queries. In your metropolitan prototype I often observe the word "Birmingham" appended to a communicatioon and therefore hope that they who contribute to your Loudon contemporary will occasionally favour your columns with a query or a note. As I said last week, I fear my notes will be few; but allow to commence by two queries.

Was the sword spoken of in my last presented to Colonel Wallace, or was the amount subscribed given to the charities of town?

Can any of yonr readers give any account of the life, or mention the residence of Mr. Hector, whom Dr. Johnson visited in this town on more than one occasion?

LITERATURE, SCIENCE, AND ART.

Before we begin our chronicle of the new year there are few arrears yet to be posted of last year's work. From week to week we have noted, necessarily briefly— partly from the quantity of material, and partly from our limited space—such additions to literature the shape of books, such advances science from papers and reports, and such works of art as have appeared during the year. This course, with some modifications, suggested by further experience, we propose to pursue, and to make this column what has always aimed to be —a trustworthy chronicle of the three great branches of knowledge included in its name. In the less crowded columns of the *Daily Post*, we shall continue from time to time our more detailed notices of remarkable works of such local matters as our Local Notes and Queries may comprise. In this column we have space only for a general sketch of the most valuable works, leaving the lighter literature and such extracts from new books as will be likely to interest our readers for the columns chiefly of the Thursday's *Post*.

Local Notes and Queries

Finding it difficult, from considerations of space, to continue our "Local Notes and Queries" in successive numbers of the Journal, we have decided on transferring them to the Daily Post, and henceforth we shall devote a portion of each Thursday's paper to this purpose. We shall be glad to receive contributions, elther "Notes" or "Queries," on any subjects of interest relating to local antiquities, history, biography, &c.

OUR OLD CHURCHYARD

To the Editor.— I trust that our esteemed townsman, Mr. Holland, may consent to give the inhabitants the benefit of his most interesting paper by publishing it. As a Sheffielder, taking very great interest in everything connected with my native town, I beg to thank you for your offer to place on record anything noteworthy in connection with our old burial grounds. I hope you will not confine your offer to these, but let it include everything noteworthy connected with Sheffield. A few years ago I made this suggestion in your columns, hoping there might be established a kind of local notes and queries, and by this means many old customs, observances, curious incidents, characteristics of a past age, be brought back for our benefit, and rescued from oblivion. I regret deeply that my suggestion was not carried out. Every year some of our old townsmen who could thus enrich your columns pass away, and their knowledge of a past age departs with them. Everything changes. The fashions of our forefathers and mothers are grotesque in our eyes, as ours will be in our grandchildrens'. Manners too are changed; old customs are dying out, and new ones are spreading in their place. Characters prominent in one generation pass away, manners fade, and customs decay; and all perish from our memory for lack of some one to fix them ere they finally depart, and by recording them to change them into history.

I, though a comparatively young man, can recollect a Sheffield very different from the present.

"All, all are changed, the old familiar faces."

And while a young man can speak of the wondrous changes in his time, what could some of our oldest inhabitants tell us if they would give us a few "jottings." I earnestly trust that Mr. Holland and such as he will take the hint I have thrown out, and rescue much belonging to our local history from the oblivion that else awaits it.

...

Yours truly, J.

Sheffield, Oct. 7, 1869.

OLD SHEFFIELD.
To the Editor. — In common with most of your Sheffield readers I feel greatly indebted to you and your correspondents for very interesting notices of Old Sheffield. In your pleasant article of Saturday last, you spoke of Sheffield as it was 40 years ago. This is about as far as I can go, and I should Uke to add a few jottings of my own written mostly about a dozen years ago. ...

...

I must conclude for it seems as if there would be no end to my letter if I were to give way to old recollections. I most ?? wish your aged readers would give us the benefit of their reminiscences of the Sheffield of their boyhood. There is a vast quantity of unwritten history that might thus be preserved to us, and if not given to us at once, will be lost for ever. I suggested some years ago, that in your columns a kind of local "Notes and Queries" might be established to the interest and delight of all Sheffield readers, and I still think the suggestion well worth entertaining.  ...

...

Yours Truly, A SHEFFIELDER.

SPECTATOR IN HALLAMSHIRE

...

I notice that your contemporary the *Times and Iris* is about to introduce what I have no doubt will prove a most interesting feature in local journalism. It will devote a portion of its space to "local notes and queries," and I see that all who take an interest "in the antiquities, in the folk-lore, and old traditions, with the curious matter generally of Sheffield" and the district, are invited to contribute. "Local notes and queries" will meet a want which the demands upon the space of daily papers make it almost impossible for them to do anything with. I am in hopes that through the columns devoted to these notes and queries, we shall learn a good deal that relates to old Sheffield and to the old worthies whose names are now only just remembered.

LOCAL QUERIES. TO THE EDITOR THE NEWCASTLE JOURNAL.

Sir, —The Illustrated London News has lately opened its columns to communicate on matters of interest to the antiquarian, artist, &c. and it has occurred to me that you might afford space, especially during the recess of parliament, to somewhat similar series of articles, restricting them (though not over-rigidly), to the counties of Northberland and Durham, or the former alone. I have frequently noticed in your valuable paper very excellent letters, betokening great ability, not inferior to those which have rendered the *Times* so famous; and it is surely not a matter of doubt that your scientific and antiquarian readers and correspondents, could (and would) support the credit of the county in the proposed subjects. The following rules ought to be adopted and adhered to, and after a little experience all would go on swimmingly:—

- Letters must be written on *one side* only of the paper, *with ink*, and not crossed.

- Care should be taken to write *clearly* all proper and *scientific* names, words in Latin or foreign languages, dates, *figures*, and copies of inscriptions.

- Disputations on political, moral, or theological questions are excluded.

- All communications must *authenticated* by the *name* and address of the writer, though he may use an *assumed name* or initials in the portion intended for publication.

- Letters to be forwarded *early* the week, and to be concise, by which the chances of insertion will be increased.

In the hope that you may he able to make some use of these observations I enclose a few questions, (some easily answered), and remain yours truly,

1. What is the etymology of the _"nine-year-auld-hole,"_ a natural cave on Brizlee-hill, near Alnwick? Is it not a corruption of some ancient British name?

2. When did the late Emperor Nicholas of Russia visit Northumberland ?

3. Are Winter's gibbet and effigy still standing on Whiskersheels Common, near Elsdon? And what is the Etymology of *Whiskersheels*?

4. In a report of the Alnwick Mechanics' Institution it stated that the present Astronomer-royal, Professor Airy, is native of that town. Is it the case ?

5. Is the nightingale ever heard in Northumberland ?

6. The misletoe is said to grow in the neighbourhood of Bedlington, and in other parts of the county. Is it a true native of the district ?

7. A writer in the *Newcastle Magazine* mentions a shellfish found in the Glen, near Wooler, possessing benumbing property like that of the electric eel, *Gymnotus electricus*. Is there a mollusc with such powers? If so, what is its scientific name?

[It seems that such a column then started to appear.]

LOCAL NOTES AND QUERIES
To the Editor of the Lancaster Guardian
Sir— It has often occurred to me that your district must be intimately associated with personal reminiscences of characters and events. Some of your townspeople will have particular partialities in these respects, and have their own fund of information which perhaps no research in books could afford to others. Could you not afford to such inquiries and answers as these, a regular weekly corner which should be kept inviolate from the fiercest incursions of the "Latest Intelligence," and whose boundaries might be sacred against the heaviest phalanx of any "pres  of matter". That phrase, Mr. Editor, *entre nous*, is a very plenary one, a convenient extinguisher of yours; but we will understand that our inquisitive corner is to be safe from its power. In this proposed institution you cannot expect from the frequent intrusion of those troublesome steeds called "hobbies". They ust each have a caper in turn, only I beg for one exception; yes, your awful veto I invoke, or else your paddock will be as full as a horse-fair, and nine-tenths of it crowded with the species which must be excluded— yes, there is an exception to all rules however general, and this exception I must urge against those indefatigable but tiresome folks, the — *fern hunters*.

But to business: here is query first— may it be one of a series which may last unLancaster extends to the sea!

... [Five separately numbered queries follow - not about ferns!] ...

These queries are sufficient for this week; if a favourable response is accorded, I shall be glad to do what I can to answer any others which may be offered, and hope your Lancaster Notes and Queries may prove of value. As inquisitive people do not like to be known as such, I must take as a *nom de plume*— EBENEEZER.



[Desire to preserve the inconsequential and oral?! But also strikes me this could be a great marketing and intelligence gathering ploy by Thoms or his agents, eg given that references to "the" Notes and Queries occasionally appeared in the local papers? As to the initially seeded queries, there was a single response in Lancaster Guardian - Saturday 25 October 1862 https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001673/18621025/044/0004 p4 but then the column heading seems to disappear again.]

[Under the above title it is our intention to publish, in the *Observer*, a series of contributions in the form of short notes and questions, on all kinds of historical subjects, but more especially Yorkshire ones. Our intention is to make the columns of "Notes and Queries" a repository of articles on these and other topics :— Archaeology, Bibliography, Biography, Ballads, Broadsides, Chap Books, Country Customs. Curious Epitaphs, Charms, Dialects, Folk Lore, Local Legends, Old Pedigrees, Proverbs, Poems, Songs. Sports.

Of course, we reserve to ourselves the right to reject any communications that may be sent that are objectionable or too trivial for publication.

NOTICE

_With the commencement of the New year we propose to publish, under the heading of "Old Worcestershire,' a collection of short articles, or paragraphs, narrating the romances, legends, superstitions, and customs peculiar to the county. Worcestershire it especially rich in traditionary lore of this kind. There is scarcely an ancient dwelling-house, and certainly not a village, which has not some association of profound interest to the archaeologist, the antiquarian, or the historian. To rescue such stories or incidents from oblivion — many of which have never found their may into print, and live only in the recollection of those who heard them from their forefathers — will be our object. They will serve to illustrate the social and public life of "Old Worcestershire ;" to throw light on many a custom the significance of which is forgotten; to elucidate the meaning of many a local saying or proverb the origin of which is ill understood. In carrying out this object we shall be grateful for, and cordially invite, the co-operation of all who have made such subjects a study, who are familiar with legends or stories, or have access to M.SS. dealing with the unwritten history of the county. Some excellent sources of information are already in our possession, but the completeness and value of the forthcoming papers will largely depend upon the extent to which we receive assistance from clergymen, professional men, and. indeed, from the public generally. All communications should be addressed either to the "Proprietor" or the "Editor" of "Berrow's Worcester Journal."_

NOTICE

_In the first issue of the JournaL for the present year we commenced to publish, and propose to continue weekly, a collection of short articles, or paragraphs, narrating the romances, legends, superstitions, and customs peculiar to the county, under the heading of "Old Worcestebshire." There it scarcely an ancient dwelling-house, and certainly not a village in the county, which has not some association of profound interest to the archaeologist, the antiquarian, or the historian. To rescue ruch stories or incidents from oblivion will be our object. They will serve to illustrate the social and public life of former times; to throw light on many a custom the significance of which is forgotten; to elucidate the meaning of many a local saying or proverb the origin of which is ill understood. In carrying out this object we shall be grateful for, and cordially invite, the co-operativn of all who have made such subjects a study, who are familiar with legends or stories, or hare access to M. SS. dealing with the unwritten hitivry of the county. Some excellent sources of information are already in our possession, but the completeness and value of the forthcoming papers will largely depend upon the extent to which we receive assistance from clergymen, professional men, and, indeed, from the public generally. All communications should be addressed to the "Editor."_

In answer to several correspondents we beg leave to state that in the publication of "Old Worcestershire" we shall not attempt to carry out any order or classification of subjects. To do so it would be necessary to have the whole of the materials in hand to commence with, and this we neither consider necessary nor desirable. It will often happen that one version of as incident, custom, or legend, will call forth a second or third communication, and it is important that all should be given in order that the public may have the benefit of the best. Then again, a prominent feature of the project will be the "queries," by which contributors may seek definite information from those who possess it, and through which we hope to elicit much that is not to be found even in the standard works on Worcestershire. Articles, therefore, will be used as they are available, and thus a greater variety will be found in what we shall be able to lay before our readers week by week— an object of some concern, as we are specially anxious to awaken popular interest in the antiquities, traditions, and peculiar customs of the county. It only remains to add that our scope is confined to Worcestershire, and that articles dealing with other counties will be useless for our present purpose. Should the project receive sufficient favour from the public at large the articles will hereafter be collected, revised by their respective authors, and published in a complete form.

TO CORRESPONDENTS

*All letters intended for insertion in these columns must of authenticated by the name and address of the sender, not necessarily for publication, but as evidence of good faith. Every facility will be afforded for the discussion of matters of public interest, but a rigid compliance with this rule will be enforced.*

*It is requested, in order to avoid, confusion and delay, that all communications intended for publication in, or having reference to, "Berrow's Worcester Journal," should be addressed either to "The Editor" or "The Proprietors," and not to any member of the staff personally.*

*We beg to remind Advertisers and Correspondents that the Journal is pubilished on Friday Afternoon, and that we cannot guarantee the insertion of any communication which does not reach us on the morning of that day.*

Worcester Journal - Saturday 12 February 1876

"The Decay of Rural Tradition."— We are indebted to the *Saturday Review* for a most generous article on the subject of "Old Worcestershire." Our object in forming that design is spoken of with discriminating approval, and our difficulties in carrying it out are fully and fairly acknowledged. From many unexpected quarters we have received assurances of interest and sympathy, and the article in our powerful contemporary will certainly afford us the utmost encouragement. In soliciting the assistance of gentlemen in the county to recover and preserve such legends, proverbs, sayings, superstitions, customs, &c. as they may encounter in their several districts, we had no idea of encroaching upon ground already worthily occupied. There are several local histories of great value; replete with historical, antiquarian, and archaeological information; works of acknowledged ability and trustworthiness. For all technical or scientific purposes these would be sufficient, but it did appear to us, and we are strongly confirmed in the impression, that there was a floating miiss of folk-lore which, unless quickly collected, would be lost altogether. Delay could only increase the difficulties of our task, and we quite share the fear of the *Saturday Review* that we are already so late in the field as to render any large measure of success uncertain and improbable. Our object is not a very ambitious or pretentious one, and some may look upon "Old Worcestershire" as a mere column of "musty gossip." That our influential contemporary so clearly recognises our aim and its value will no doubt prove a strong incentive to further effort on the part of the many clergymen and gentlemen who have accorded us their aid. If we can but succeed in gathering together the stories, incidents, customs, and ballads which linger in the popular memory in out-of-the-way places in the county, we shall have accomplished a usefnl work. Such information will serve to give a distinct personal and local colouring to the dry facts of history, will clothe such dry bones "with living flesh and blood." The bald details are widely known; the dates and circumstances of historical events are familiar to the very school-children. But how many men, even among those who can boastof imagination and culture, can realise for themselves the vivid colouring which such knowledge would have if they could picture the costumes, sayings, pastimes, and feelings of their forefathers. The difference is as marked as that between an anatomical diagram with its figures and lines, and a historical painting instinct with life, action, and force. Many an ancient ballad or carol, many a legend or saying, lingers about the country-side which would throw a flood of light upon the forgotten or obscure social life of the past. Why shouid this work have been so long neglected, when some of our greatest scholars have devoted years of enquiry and research to do as much for ancient Greece and Rome? The history of Worcestershire ought to be something more than a collection of dates and events; it ought to be full of graphic and stirring glimpses into social habits and personal peculiarities. The *Saturday Review*, indeed, claims a far higher value for the project we have set on foot, and points out that "it might help to solve several questions of general historical interest." That "chronological puzzle— the date of the Reformation," is mentioned as one among other questions, and as one on which accurate information as to the length of time occupied in the process would strangely confound popular theories and fallacies. "And not a few shreds and bits of broken material would extend the suggestion to an earlier date, in the change from Pagan to Christian worship, and indicate in various charms and superstitions that the old gods, like the Canaanites, held their ground in many a hill-fastness for a long time after the general conquest of their land." Upon such questions as these further light would indeed be welcome, and we are convinced that many sources of information might be found in the county . The *Saturday Review* points to the district north and north-west of Malvern as an undeveloped mine of tradition, and we can quite believe any searches there would be richly rewarded with success. Whether we shall be able to make "Old Worcestershire" subservient to the high historical ends referred to we cannot yet venture to say, but we are not without hope that the challenge will be taken up. No county offers more favourable conditions for such enquiries, and there are plenty of local gentlemen in every way capable of dealing with them. The kindly allusions made by the *Saturday Review* to the difficulties of our task, show a clear insight into its practical working. Much of the matter which appears in our weekly column of "Old Worcestershire" will be useless for publication hereafter; and very much, if not all, that is selected will need careful revision. It would be unwise to exclude the former, because it has some interest to our readers, and we are anxious not to dishearten those who help us as far as they can. Final selection will be impossible until our project is completed, so that the same subject may be expected to crop up again and again, and occupy different writers. This is not without its drawbacks, but it will enable us to present to our readers all that can be gathered on any particular subject, and will lend completeness to our work hereafter. In conclusion, we must bear grateful testimony to the zealous interest with which our design bas been taken up, and to the great value of the services so promptly and cheerfully rendered by clergymen and professional men. The whole merit of the work rests with our contributors, and its future is in their hands. From all persons co-operation will be cordially accepted, and from what we have so far experienced we may confidently hope that the interest and value of "Old Worcestershire" will widen week by week, and that: ultimately it will prove a useful addition to the historical and antiquarian literature of the county.

Our Folk-Lore Column.

We recently called the attention of our readers to the proposed Folk-lore society, and took occasion to point out in how short a time the study was developed. Its importance is generally recognised not only by the many volumes annually published, dealing exclusively with Folklore, but also by the fact that very many newspapers in England and elsewhere now devote a considerable space weekly or monthly to communications on the subject. Hitherto, we fancy, however, that few Scottish newspapers have followed the excellent example, and are glad to be among the first to introduce *A Folk-Lore Column* to our readers. Notes on all subjects connected with the history of the country, or the people, with the superstitions or the orthodox beliefs, legends or old rhymes, will be welcomed by us, especially should they deal with Ayrshire, or Ayrshire folks or fancies. We will also be glad to receive *Queries* on any questions of interest, particularly as respects byegone days, and hope that our readers will persuade themselves to let the inquiring ones learn all their quaint legends and recollections; that they will not be backward communicating that Folk-lore which is so ever-present in the minds of many, and yet so difficult to get at. Some old people we know are afraid that in these modern days their "auld wives tales" will be derided, and they, the narrators, laughed at for mentioning them. This is a mistake; it is only the ignorant and the half-cultured who mock faiths and old fears. By the intelligent the studious it is often found that in those antique "remains" is found the key to the character of the people. In this column we shall all communications, and hope that many will be the curious notes sent us, which may be recognised by the students of Folk-lore as valuable, and matter which they will not willingly let die.

[There follow several items which have be *communicated privately, in the hope of eliciting communications by some Folklorists who are interested in the diffusion of the study*.]

> ...
> Answers to any or all of the queries we shall be glad to publish in this column. (1) Communications signed with pseudonymns must be accompanied in all cases by the writer's name and address, not necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith; (2) each should be written on one side of the paper only, (3) should be addressed "To the Editor of the Folklore Column, *Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald*, Princes Street, Ardrossan."

Our Folk-Lore Column

Sir,—In Dr Dorran's *Notes and Queries*, London, I am pleased to see the *Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald* noticed by one of the Doctor's correspondents as a paper which has latterly devoted a column to such antiquated items as "Folk-lore," and other such matters relating to Ayrshire. And I am doubly pleased, because of the difficulty there is in having an article inserted in the said London *N. and Q.*, that is tending to correct or in any way contradict things that have been advanced in their columns which were not facts. Now, unless you open your columns to expiscate local facts, and give both sides of the question, then you had better keep them closed. Dr Doran can afford to be despotic to those whom he may conceive to be country clodhoppers; but the fact is, there are some folks who don't date from *Rectories and Colleges* could give him a wrinkle both in folklore and other things, if he would allow himself to open his eyes to read. In proof of this, my assertion, I would refer to communications which I have sent him from time to time, correcting errors which have appeared in his *Notes and Queries*— not the half of which he has published. If you are so kind as insert this "stickful," I shall send the editor of London *Notes and Queries* a copy of the *Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald*, drawing his attention to this paragraph, and will, in anything worthy of a note or query coming under my notice in future, give you a line or two thereon.—I am, dear Sir, yours truly, JAMES McKIE.
Alpha, Kilmarnock, 16th Oct., 1877.

NOTES AND QUERIES. Sir,— I have read with some surprise Mr McKie's letter in your issue of last week. Like him I wish all success to the Folk-lore column of *Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald*, and am glad that he promises contributions, but it is difficult understand his abuse of *Notes and Queries*. I cannot but think that upon consideration of, say only one or two of the many volumes of that journal, he would withdraw his statement that it is difficult to get "an article inserted in the London *N. and Q.*, that is tending to correct, or in any way contradict things that have been advanced in their columns which were not facts." The meaning of this sentence is somewhat hard to find, as it was said the wood cannot be seen for trees, so here the sense can hardly he seen for the words, but it seems to come to this, that Mr McKie charges the Editor of *Notes and Queries*, with deliberately refusing to admit anything which does not agree with his own views on any subject under discussion. On the contrary—all sides are, as far as my observation *and experience* go, made freely welcome, and opinions the most divergent appear on the same page. I am sorry Dr Baran should have been so cruel as to refuse some of Mr McKie's contributions; but the will surely allow that it is an editor's duty, to very duty he is chosen to fulfil, to *select* what is to be published, not merely to print indiscriminately all things on all matters sent by correspondents, even from Kilmarnock. I am, &c. B. Glasgow, 22nd October, 1877.
