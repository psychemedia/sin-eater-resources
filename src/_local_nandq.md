LOCAL "NOTES AND QUERIES."

*To the Editor of the Birmingham Journal*.  
Sir,—I have often thought, especially lately, in the interesting sketches of our good old town in your Wednesday's paper, how useful column of local "Notes and Queries" would be. There are many men now living who could give much valuable information about the social, political, and industrial history of the town during the last half century. Many old men are the only depositories of this local knowledge, and when they depart, it will become mere tradition. I see your venerable contemporary, the *Gazette*, is about to open its columns for antiquarian or probably ecclesiatical notes and queries ; and as I do not often see that paper, and am more interested in general matters, it has occurred to me that you might have half column in tour Wednesday's paper for general notes aud queries about local matters. I cannot promise to contribute to the " notes," I fear, but shall probably be a troublesome correspondent as far as the "queries" are concerned. For example, in a late chapter of his history the writer spoke of the "sword presented to Colonel Wallace" for refusing to fire on the people here. Now an old triend of mine says believes that the gallant Colonel declined any testimonial, and that the amount collected was given to the charities of the town. Is this so? What are the real facts of the case? Scores of people here must know ; and surely none would grudge ten minutes to give, in the suggested column, a satisfactory reply.

I am. Sir, your obedient servant, ENQUIRER.

[We shall happy be to open the columns of our Wednesday's paper to such subjects. interesting criticism on the remarks offered in the " Literary Leader" of Wednesday last, on the text of Shakspeare, will be a fitting commencement of this department of our paper. Ed. Journal.

LITERATURE, SCIENCE AND ART

Our readers will observe in another part of this day’s paper the commencement of a weekly portion devoted local "Notes aud Queries." The importance of the object needs no explanation and no defence. We confess we did contemplate some such corner some months ago, but the insertion of this series of articles in some degree interfered with the proposal, and we thought no more of it umtil reminded of the matter in by a letter last week. We hope that any of the readers of this column who can contribute any note, however brief, illustrative of the manners and customs of Birmingham or its vicinity in earlier days, who can explain any difficulty, clear away any doubt, or throw any light on our local history, will be glad do so as often and briefly as they can.

QUERIES.

Sir,—I am glad you have so readily adopted my suggestion for a column of local Notes and Queries. In your metropolitan prototype I often observe tbe word " Birmingham" appended to a communicatioon and therefore hope that they who contribute to your Loudon contemporary will occasionally favour your columns with a query or a note. As I said last week, I fear my notes will be few ; but allow to commence by two queries.

Was the sword spoken of in my last presented to Colonel Wallace, or was the amount subscribed given to the charities of town?

Can any of yonr readers give any account of the life, or mention the residence of Mr. Hector, whom Dr. Johnson visited in this town on more than one occasion ?

LITERATURE, SCIENCE, AND ART.

Before we begin our chronicle of the new year there are few arrears yet to be posted of last year's work. From week to week we have noted, necessarily briefly— partly from the quantity of material, and partly from our limited space—such additions to literature the shape of books, such advances science from papers and reports, and such works of art as have appeared during the year. This course, with some modifications, suggested by further experience, we propose to pursue, and to make this column what has always aimed to be —a trustworthy chronicle of the three great branches of knowledge included in its name. In the less crowded columns of the *Daily Post*, we shall continue from time to time our more detailed notices of remarkable works of such local matters as our Local Notes and Queries may comprise. In this column we have space only for a general sketch of the most valuable works, leaving the lighter literature and such extracts from new books as will be likely to interest our readers for the columns chiefly of the Thursday's *Post*.

Local Notes and Queries

Finding it difficult, from considerations of space, to continue our "Local Notes and Queries" in successive numbers of the Journal, we have decided on transferring them to the Daily Post, and henceforth we shall devote a portion of each Thursday's paper to this purpose. We shall be glad to receive contributions, elther " Notes " or " Queries," on any subjects of interest relating to local antiquities, history, biography, &c.

OUR OLD CHURCHYARD

To the Editor.— I trust that our esteemed townsman, Mr. Holland, may consent to give the inhabitants the benefit of his most interesting paper by publishing it. As a Sheffielder, taking very great interest in everything connected with my native town, I beg to thank you for your offer to place on record anything noteworthy in connection with our old burial grounds. I hope you will not confine your offer to these, but let it include everything noteworthy connected with Sheffield. A few years ago I made thia suggestion in your columns, hoping there might be established a kind of local notes and queries, and by this means many old customs, observances, curious incidents, characteristics of a past age, be brought back for our benefit, and rescued from oblivion. I regret deeply that my suggestion was not carried out. Every year some of our old townsmen who could thus enrich your columns pass away, and their knowledge of a past age departs with them. Everything changes. The fashions of our forefathers and mothers are grotesque in our eyes, as ours will be in our grandchildrens'. Manners too are changed; old customs are dying out, and new ones are spreading in their place. Characters prominent in one generation pass away, manners fade, and customs decay ; and all perish from our memory for lack of some one to fix them ere they finally depart, and by recording them to change them into history.

I, though a comparatively young man, can recollect a Sheffield very different from the present.

"All, all are changed, the old familiar faces."

And while a young man can speak of the wondrous changes in his time, what could some of our oldest inhabitants tell us if they would give us a few " jottings." I earnestly trust that Mr. Holland and such as he will take the hint I have thrown out, and rescue much belonging to our local history from the oblivion that else awaits it.

...

Yours truly, J.

Sheffield, Oct. 7, 1869.

OLD SHEFFIELD.
To the Editor. — In common with most of your Sheffield readers I feel greatly indebted to you and your correspondents for very interesting notices of Old Sheffield. In your pleasant article of Saturday last, you spoke of Sheffield as it was 40 years ago. This is about as far as I can go, and I should Uke to add a few jottings of my own written mostly about a dozen years ago. ...

...

I must conclude for it seems as if there would be no end to my letter if I were to give way to old recollections. I most ?? wish your aged readers would give us the benefit of their reminiscences of the Sheffield of their boyhood. There is a vast quantity of unwritten history that might thus be preserved to us, and if not given to us at once, will be lost for ever. I suggested some years ago, that in your columns a kind of local "Notes and Queries" might be established to the interest and delight of all Sheffield readers, and I still think the suggestion well worth entertaining.  ...

...

Yours Truly, A SHEFFIELDER.

SPECTATOR IN HALLAMSHIRE

...

I notice that your contemporary the *Times and Iris* is about to introduce what I have no doubt will prove a most interesting feature in local journalism. It will devote a portion of its space to " local notes and queries," and I see that all who take an interest "in the antiquities, in the folk-lore, and old traditions, with the curious matter generally of Sheffield " and the district, are invited to contribute. " Local notes and queries " will meet a want which the demands upon the space of daily papers make it almost impossible for them to do anything with. I am in hopes that through the columns devoted to these notes and queries, we shall learn a good deal that relates to old Sheffield and to the old worthies whose names are now only just remembered.

LOCAL QUERIES. TO THE EDITOR THE NEWCASTLE JOURNAL.

Sir, —The Illustrated London News has lately opened its columns to communicate on matters of interest to the antiquarian, artist, &c. and it has occurred to me that you might afford space, especially during the recess of parliament, to somewhat similar series of articles, restricting them (though not over-rigidly), to the counties of Northberland and Durham, or the former alone. I have frequently noticed in your valuable paper very excellent letters, betokening great ability, not inferior to those which have rendered the *Times* so famous ; and it is surely not a matter of doubt that your scientific and antiquarian readers and correspondents, could (and would) support the credit of the county in the proposed subjects. The following rules ought to be adopted and adhered to, and after a little experience all would go on swimmingly:—

- Letters must be written on *one side* only of the paper, *with ink*, and not crossed.

- Care should be taken to write *clearly* all proper and *scientific* names, words in Latin or foreign languages, dates, *figures*, and copies of inscriptions.

- Disputations on political, moral, or theological questions are excluded.

- All communications must *authenticated* by the *name* and address of the writer, though he may use an *assumed name* or initials in the portion intended for publication.

- Letters to be forwarded *early* the week, and to be concise, by which the chances of insertion will be increased.

In the hope that you may he able to make some use of these observations I enclose a few questions, (some easily answered), and remain yours truly,

1. What is the etymology of the _"nine-year-auld-hole,"_ a natural cave on Brizlee-hill, near Alnwick ? Is it not a corruption of some ancient British name?

2. When did the late Emperor Nicholas of Russia visit Northumberland ?

3. Are Winter's gibbet and effigy still standing on Whiskersheels Common, near Elsdon ? And what is the Etymology of *Whiskersheels*?

4. In a report of the Alnwick Mechanics' Institution it stated that the present Astronomer-royal, Professor Airy, is native of that town. Is it the case ?

5. Is the nightingale ever heard in Northumberland ?

6. The misletoe is said to grow in the neighbourhood of Bedlington, and in other parts of the county. Is it a true native of the district ?

7. A writer in the *Newcastle Magazine* mentions a shellfish found in the Glen, near Wooler, possessing benumbing property like that of the electric eel, *Gymnotus electricus*. Is there a mollusc with such powers? If so, what is its scientific name?

[It seems that such a column then started to appear.]

LOCAL NOTES AND QUERIES
To the Editor of the Lancaster Guardian
Sir— It has often occurred to me that your district must be intimately associated with personal reminiscences of characters and events. Some of your townspeople will have particular partialities in these respects, and have their own fund of information which perhaps no research in books could afford to others. Could you not afford to such inquiries and answers as these, a regular weekly corner which should be kept inviolate from the fiercest incursions of the "Latest Intelligence," and whose boundaries might be sacred against the heaviest phalanx of any "pres  of matter". That phrase, Mr. Editor, *entre nous*, is a very plenary one, a convenient extinguisher of yours; but we will understand that our inquisitive corner is to be safe from its power. In this proposed institution you cannot expect from the frequent intrusion of those troublesome steeds called "hobbies". They ust each have a caper in turn, only I beg for one exception; yes, your awful veto I invoke, or else your paddock will be as full as a horse-fair, and nine-tenths of it crowded with the species which must be excluded— yes, there is an exception to all rules however general, and this exception I must urge against those indefatigable but tiresome folks, the — *fern hunters*.

But to business: here is query first— may it be one of a series which may last unLancaster extends to the sea!

... [Five separately numbered queries follow - not about ferns!] ...

These queries are sufficient for this week; if a favourable response is accorded, I shall be glad to do what I can to answer any others which may be offered, and hope your Lancaster Notes and Queries may prove of value. As inquisitive people do not like to be known as such, I must take as a *nom de plume*— EBENEEZER.



[Desire to preserve the inconsequential and oral?! But also strikes me this could be a great marketing and intelligence gathering ploy by Thoms or his agents, eg given that references to "the" Notes and Queries occasionally appeared in the local papers? As to the initially seeded queries, there was a single response in Lancaster Guardian - Saturday 25 October 1862 https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001673/18621025/044/0004 p4 but then the column heading seems to disappear again.]

LOCAL NOTES AND QUERIES

[Under the above title it is our intention to publish, in the *Observer*, a series of contributions in the form of short notes and questions, on all kinds of historical subjects, but more especially Yorkshire ones.

Curious Epitaphs, Charms, Dialects, Folk Lore, Local Legends, Old Pedigrees, Proverbs, Poems, Songs. Sports. Superstitions, Traditions, Weather Wisdom, Wisdom Rhymes, Wise Sayings, Willls and Witchcraft. Here is surely scope enough ; and communications are respectfully invited by the Editor, subject to the follwoing rules :—

Contributions must be written *on one side of the paper only*: they *must* also bear the full name and address of the writer, not for pubUcation, unless the sender desire it. Of course, we reserve to ourselves the right to reject any communications that may be sent that are objectionable or too trivial for publication. All letters to be addressed "'Notes and Queries', *Observer* Office, Bradford, Yorkshire."]
