> However, the man who has the distinction of being Shropshire's last known sin eater, was not a poor man, but a sheep farmer whose family had farmed in the vicinity of Ratlinghope for generations. He in fact chose to revive the custom, and when you read the inscriptions set around his very striking memorial in Ratlinghope churchyard, you begin to understand why. Between 1862 and 1870, Richard and Ann Munslow lost four of their children. And so it is thought that Richard took on sin eating in response to this loss and as an expression of compassion. On a happier note, he and Ann did have two more children who outlived them. Richard died in 1906, his family grave set in the most peaceful of spots and in sight of the Long Mynd where he held the sheep grazing.

HEREFORD: Sinful diet
26 JANUARY 2010

HE WAS the last known "sin-eater" — a man called Richard Munslow, who was buried in the churchyard at Ratlinghope, in Hereford diocese, in 1906. "Sin-eating was a practice peculiar to the Marches, the land on the borders between England and Wales," says the Rector, the Revd Norman Morris. "It was a very odd practice, and would not have been approved of by the Church, but I suspect the Vicar often turned a blind eye."

Historically, he says, the custom involved a beggar or poor person eating bread and drinking the local brew across the body of someone who had died unprepared for death. A payment was then made, and it was believed that the sins of the dead person were now in the sin-eater, so the soul could go to heaven in peace.

The sin-eater was usually ex­cluded from the village com­munity, but on the 75-year-old Richard Munslow's gravestone are the words "In loving memory"; so the sins he accumulated could not have been that great.

Sadly, the gravestone has partly fallen, but Mr Morris is deter­mined it shall be fully restored, even if he has no intention of reviving the custom it commem­orates. A stonemason has said he can do the work for £900, and the money is coming in.

A strange folk-tradition will be kept in local memory, as will the prayer uttered by the sin-eater:

"I give easement and rest now to thee, dear man. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace I pawn my own soul. Amen."
