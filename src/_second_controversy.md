# Second Controversy, 1895

Following the report in *The Times* of Captain Hinde's paper "On Cannibalism" presented to *Section H - Anthropology* at the *Sixty-fifth Meeting of The British Association* at Ipswich, September, 1895, a letter to the editor appeared in the issue of Wednesday, September 18th, 1895, from a certain Mr. N. W. Thomas, of Oswestry, taking issue the remarks made by E. Sidney Hartland reported therefrom.

Let's review what Hartland was reported by the *Times* as saying:

```{admonition} Mr E. S.Hartland responding to Captain Hinde

> Mr. E. S. HARTLAND said that in all probability the earliest form of cannibalism was that of the eating of deceased relatives. This practice extended over bhe greater part of the world, and many people would be surprised to learn that traces of it were to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own islands. Not very long ago in Upper Bavaria, when a man died and had been laid out, a cake was made of ordinary flour. The corpse was placed before the fire, and this cake, called the corpse cake, was put upon its breast to rise. The dough, in rising, was believed to absorb all the virtues of the deceased, and the cake was afterwards eaten by his nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peniusula an edible image of the dead was carried in the funeral procession. When the body was buried the mourners ate this image above the grave, saying as they did so, "God rest him." In Wales the practice of employing a "sin-eater" had only ceased within the memory of men still living. It was the custom for the nearest relative, usually a woman, to hand across the bier, or place upon the breast of the corpse, bread, cheese, and beer, which were eaten by the sin-eater, who pronounced everlasting rest to the departed. It was believed that the sin-eater by this means appropriated to himself all the sins which the deceased had committed during his lifetime.
```

So what did Mr Thomas have to say in response to that in his later published September 18th, 1895

```{index} triple: Second Controversy ; responses, initial ; Thomas, N. W.
```
> THE SIN EATER IN WALES.
>
> TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
>
> Sir,
>
> In your issue of Monday Mr. E. S. Hartland is reported to have said, in the course of a discussion on cannibalism in the Anthropological Section of the British Association, that the sin-eater has only disappeared from Wales within living memory.

Since he appears to be familiar with Hartland's peice in *Folklore*, he assumes that material provides the evidence for Harltand's claims made at the British Association meeting:

> If, as I imagine, Mr. Hartland's evidence for this survival is presented to us in his article on the subject in Folklore for June, 1892, I venture to think it is wholly insufficiant. Mr. Hartland's words are (p. 148), " Mr. Moggridge specified the neighbourhood of Llandebie. . . as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period." These words are a paraphrase from the report of the Archaeologia Cambrensis, Vol. III., N.S., p. 330. The exact words used by Mr. Moggridge are as follows :-' There (near Llandebie) the above practice (of the sin-eater) was said to have prevailed to a recent period. "

And with this evidence, he takes issue:

> This evidence is originally at best second hand; it is unfortunate that Mr. Hartland has emphasized its value; in the article in Folklore, Mr. Moggridge's evidence has the appearance of beiug the result of personal observation. Thuw at the outset Mr. Hartland's evidence is weakened.

To aid the reader, Thomas points to the evidence previously amassed against the claimed tradition in the course of the first controversy:

> But to any one who has considered the discussion in the Academy in the winter of 1870-76 it seems quite incredible that Mr. Moggridge's evidence should be quoted at all. Canon Silvan Evans collected the evidence on the question. Among others, the vicar of the parish and the schoolmaster testified to the non-existence of the superstition. The vicar quoted an intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in the parish. He said that such a custorm, in his opinion, could not have appeared for the last 200 years, or he would have heard of it from his father or grandfather, who lived to a great age. The vicar concluded that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge could not be substantiated by any reliable evidence.
>
> The schoolmaster, Mr. John Rowland, who lived in Llandebie in 1852, when Mr. Moggridge spoke, was equally emphatic. He said he knew all the parishioners and the history of the parish, its customs, legends, and traditions, and during the time he was there he attended many funerals, but never heard of a sin-eater ; in fact, people never gave cakes at funerals in Llandebie.

Thomas then wonders if Hartland may be unaware of that earlier controversy, but I wonder, is his tone curious, or incredulous?

> Is it possible that Mr. Hartland has never seen this discussion, or has he ignored it ? In the face of this evidence it seems to me impossible to assert that the sin-eater was known within living memory in the locality named.

```{index} single: Davies, T. Eynon ; letter to Christian World
```
Mr Thomas then refers to a letter from a *Rev. T. Eynon Davies* in 1882 to *Christian World*, apparently debunking Paxtod Hood's description of the sin-eater:

> In addition to this, in February, 1882, the Rev. T. Eynon Davies published a letter in the Christian World a propos of Paxton Hood's "Christmas Evans." Mr. Davies was Congregational minister in Cwmannan, near Llandebie, and said, "Some octogenarians whom I have questioned have never seen a sin-eater, neither have they heard their parents nor their grandparents refer to this custom." There is, in fact, no evidence that he ever existed in Wales at all. All the stories go back to Aubrey's "lean, long, ugly, lamentable,poor Raskel "; and he was at Ross, in Herefordshire, if we believe Aubrey, none too strong a witness.

*I have still to track down a copy of the full letter to Christian World.*

We then have a phrase very evocative of our own times — "false news" — lamenting that it may be understandable in the press, but not in the pages of an amateru (which is to say, professional) society.

> If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the " sin-eater " in modern times, stamped originally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, sealed 30 years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association. Even the Celtic fringe does not deserve this treatment.,I am, &c.,
>
> N. W. THOMAS., Oswestry.

```{margin}
In passing, I note the following item in the column immediately following Mr Thomas' letter:

> SANDOWN PIER, ISLE OF WIGHT.
>
> The Attorney General and Miss Webster yesterday performed the ceremony of opening the pier and pier pavilion in Sandown Bay. The pier has been lengthened by 545ft., with a pier-head 107ft. by 93ft., and a pavilion has been built capable of accommodating 400 people, at a total cost of about £12,800. The pier and pavilion were illuminated in the evening.

On [Thursday, September 19th, 1895](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3735405/3735409/35/), p4, in the *South Wales Daily News*, the indignant closing refrain of from the *Times* letter was remarked upon:

> Welsh Gossip
>
> A correspondent of the Times waxes wroth over the sin-eater fiction propagated before the British Association. Says he: "If dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society. The fiction of the sin-eater in modern times, stamped orininally with the imprimatur of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, sealed 30 years later by the Folklore Society, has now received the august sanction of the British Association. Even the Celtic fringe does not deserve this treatment."

The following day, in the *Times* of Friday, September 20th, 1895, p7, one reader doubts the claims surrounding the sin-eating practice, but swiftly goes on to provides an example of another peculiar funeral custom:
```{index} double: funeral customs ; smoking in church
```
> SMOKING IN CHURCH.
>
> Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to us from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing :- "Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an old practice -viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850. "The Communion-table stood in the aisle, and the farmers were in the habit of putting their hats upon it, and when the sermon began they lit their pipes and smoked, but without any idea of irreverance. I have not seen this practice mentioned in any book, and though it is not desirable that it abould be revived, it seems a pity that it should be forgotten."

The same letter that also reprinted directly in the [*Western Mail*, p5](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4333187/4333192/55/) and [*Evening Express*, p2,](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3256094/3256096/38/), September 21st, 1895, the [*Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald and North and South Wales Independent*, September 27th, p5](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3602607/3602612/37/) and [*The North Wales Express*, October 4th, 1895, p8](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3565788/3565796/67/).

It also appeared in *Bye-Gones* of [September 25th, 1895](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2098314/13#?xywh=-1536%2C-192%2C5820%2C3838), p176,with the additional closing line:

> Some of the readers of Bye-Gones can carry their memories back to 1850. Can they confirm this ? W.O.

```{admonition} The Ede Letter, Answered in Notes & Queries, November 9th, 1895

In *Notes and Queries* dated [November 9th, 1895](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1895-11-09_8_202/page/366/mode/2up?q=smoking), p366, the letter also appear in a note with some additionaly commentary:

> Smoking in Church .—The following is a cutting from a recent number of the Times :—
>
> "Mr. Elton B. Ede writes to us from Edenhurst, Heene, Worthing :— 'Though the sin-eater in Wales may not have existed, the mention of him recalls an oldpractice—viz., smoking in church, which I remember my mother telling me she saw in Wales about 1850.

>
> I remember reading somewhere that it was a custom among ladies in South America to have chocolate brought to them as soon as the sermon commenced— a practice denounced by the bishop, who preached against it. He, however, had his cup of chocolate in the sacristy after the service. His persistence in denouncing it was followed by his being found dead in the sacristy after having drunk his cup of chocolate.

Meanwhile, Sidney Hartland was penning his initial response in a letter appearing on Tuesday, Sept. 24th, 1895, p4:

```{index} triple: Second Controversy ; responses, initial ; Hartland, Edwin Sidney
```
> THE SIN-EATER, TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
>
> Sir,
>
> Amid the hurry of the concluding meetings of the British Association I did not see Mr. Thomas's letter in your issue of Wednesday last; and it is only to-day that I have had an opportunity of reading it. I am much obliged to him for calling my attention to the fact that the existence of the sin-eater in Wales has been questioned.

He then wonders why Mr. Thomas did not contribute to the correspondence around his (Hartland's) article in *Folklore* and raise his concerns in a more timely fashion there:

> I gather that he is a reader of Folklore. Had he challenged the statements in my article when it was published there, I should have been doubly grateful, since my only object is to elicit and preserve the truth; assuredly not to cast any imputation upon Welshmen I have never seen the discussion in the Academy, nor Mr. Eynon Davies's letter in the Christian World to which Mr. Thomas refers; nor have I, until now, heard of any doubt being thrown upon the matter.

As to the controversy in the pages of the *Academy*, it seems that Hartland *was* unaware of them:

> Unfortunately, I have no access here to the old numbers of the Academy. Will Mr. Thomas kindly add to my obligation by lending me those containing the discussion on the sin-eater, if he have copies of them? Meantime, I reserve all observations upon the evidence until I have seen them. I am. &eC.,
>
> E. SIDNEY HARTLAND.,
> Highgarth, Gloucester, Sept. 20.

Also in the *Times* of September 24th, 1895, p4, correspondent *Z.* pickes up on Ede's briefly stated concerns and refers him to the mention of the sin-eater in *The Mountain Decameron*, apparently unaware that the description was a fiction:

> TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
>
> Sir,
>
> With reference to the Welsh superstition of the sin-eater, the existence of which is doubted by Mr. Ede, those interested in the question may like to know that a full account of the superstition is given in "The Mountain Decameron," by Joseph Downes, a now very rare book, published by Bentley in 1836, in three volumes.
>
> On page 232 of vol. 3 there is the following heading - "The Last Sin-Eater of Wales, a Sketch," &c.
>
> The chapter that follows is most interesting and minute, and seemns to be a literal transcript of fact. It is not strange, however, that the oldest inhabitant now living should not have heard of "the sin-eater," since Joseph Downe, writing in 1836, himself says in the sentence introductory to his sketch, "So late an the earlier part of the last century that strange character of a stranger superstition known by the name of 'the sin-eater' was not unknown in Wales."
>
> What follows is an account in quotation marks of "what is believed to be the last sin-eater in Wales," taken apparently from the printed work of some traveller whom Downes does not name. It is too long for quotation, but should be read by any one interested in the subject, as details of place and incident are so vivid that the traveller's experience can scarcely be doubted. I am, Sir, yours obediently,
>
> Z.

During the original controversry, the readers of *Bye-Gones* were kept informed about the debate as it progressed, and with the opening salvos fired, it seems that a similar editorial line kicked in again. In the issue of *Bye-Gones* dated [September 25, 1895](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2098314/14#?xywh=-1536%2C158%2C5820%2C3838), p177-8, a column appeared introducing this latest appearance of the sin-eater under the title *THE STORY OF THE SIN-EATER IN WALES*. The column reprinted the review in *The Times* of Mr Hartland's comments made during the discussion following Captain Hinde's paper, Mr Thomas' letter taking issue with those comments, and Mr Hartand's reply. Mr Thomas' letter was followed by the following comment:

> The subject was dealt with in *Bye-Gones* for 1874-5 and 1876-7, where much of the correspondence in the *Academy* was reproduced.

In the *Western Mail* of [Wednesday, September 25th, 1895](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4333214/4333221), p7, E. Sidney Hartland also replied to the correpsondence received from Gwynfardd Dyfed that included the extended  Moggridge references and quote from the *Mopuntain Decameron*:

> CORRESPONDENCE
>
> THE "SIN-EATER."
>
> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "WESTERN MAIL."
>
> Sir,-
>
> I am greatly interested to see that your contributor, "Gwynfardd Dyfed," has quoted an account of the custom  of the "sin-eater" as witnessed not so very long ago in Cardiganshire. As my statement at the British Association, and, indeed, the possession by Wales of this curious and important relic of the past at any recent period (or at all, if I understand him: rightly), has been challenged by a gentleman who writes in the "Times," "Gwynfardd Dyfed" will confer an obligation on me and on all students of Welsh antiquities if he will kindly give in your paper a reference to the work from which he quotes (including exact title, page, date, and place of publication), and also state his authority for the survival of the custom in Cwmamman to 1881, for it seems to me that this was denied in 1882 by the Rev. T. Eynon Davies in the "Christian World."
>
> I am &c..
> E. SIDNEY HARTLAND
> Highgarth, Gloucester.

It seems that Mr Hartland has by this point managed to obtain sight of the *Christian World* letter *which I still have not!) but he is unable to identify source of the descriptions provided by Gwynfardd Dyfed.

A couple of weeks later, a response from Gwynfardd Dyfed appears in the *Western Mail* dated [October 8th, 1895](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4333313/4333320/113/sin%20eater), p7, apologising for the delay in replying:

> THE SIN-EATER.
>
> LETTER FROM "GWYNFARDD DYFED."
>
> In reply to Mr. E. Sidney Hartland's letter on this subject which appeared in our issue of September 25 last, "Gwynfardd Dyfedd" writes:– "I regret that, owing to my having been in a weak state of health recently, I have been unable before to give Mr. Hartland the additional information which he requires in support of the statements adduced in my article on the sin-eater in Wales.

He then gives his sources:

> It gives me much pleasure to find that Mr. Hartland was greatly interested in my contribution to the scanty literature on the subject of the alleged prevalence in bygone days of this sin-eating custom in the Principality and on its borders. Students of Welsh antiquities may like to know that the works quoted from by me on the subject are as under:— Pp. 52, 53, and 54 of 'Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales: With the Scenery of the River Wye,' by Thomas Roscoe, Esquire, published in 1854 by Mr. Henry G. Bohn. York-street, Covent Garden;

That reference, relating to Fosbroke, actual points to the *Mountain Decameron* in the original.

Gwynfardd Dyfed also cites *Cymru Fu*, the Welsh version of *Notes & Queries, which in turn sourced material from Paxton Hood and Blackwood's Magazine of 1875:

> also pp. 92 and 166 of Part II, of 'Cymru Fu - Notes and Queries Relating to the Past History of Wales and Border Counties,' published in 1888 by Messrs. Daniel Owen and Co. (Limited), of St. Mary-street, Cardiff. In these notes in "Cymru Fu" the writers on this subject in turn draw their information from Paxton Hood's Christmas Evans, and from 'Blackwood' (November, 1875). By consulting those sources as well, Mr. Hartland may come across more matter relating to this curious and superstitious custom, now obsolete. Possibly, do thorough investigation of the matter would result in much more about it being brought to light. If a few of the oldest people in the neighbourhood of Cwmamman, in Glamorganshire, were interviewed, surely some folk-lore respecting the sin-eater might be obtained.

He also contributes personal experience:

> I have talked to several old Pembrokeshire folk about the practice, but they appear to know nothing of such a custom; they, however, tell me that the plate of salt is still used in a great many eases. This, too, has come within my own personal experience. It is a pewter plate that is mostly used, if one such can be got. One old lady, now deceased, used to keep a pewter plate which she was in the habit of lending out for the purpose. It was also customary in the same county to place coins upon the eyelids of oorpses to keep their eyes closed. Are the coins and the plate of salt all mere relies of the sin-eating custom, or does their use possess any real efficacy? This important question is one which the medical man could assist the antiquary by answering."
