> From time to time astounding instances reach us of English ignorance with regard to Welsh national habits and customs. Not many months ago a note in the *Red Dragon* calling attention to a silly statement anent "The Sin Eater" by the Rev. Paxton Hood in his book on "Christmas Evans" the means of eliciting from Mr. Askew Roberts, J.P., an accomplished antiquarian, of Oswestry, a most able paper, in which the whole myth was so Giffard to another equally superficial observer, old John Aubrey. Perhaps it waa too much to expect strict accuracy on Welsh matters of a writer like Mr. Paxton Hood, who once described Llanidloes as the home of the *really great poet*, John Dyer," and, *mirabile dictu!* spoke of Grongar Hill as "a delicious spot in that neighbourhood." Mr. Hood, with the usual lightness of a professional bookmaker, appears to have hashed up the story of "The Sin Eater" from Murray's "Handbook to South Wales," without troubling himself to alter much of the phraseology, still less to inquire into the existence of tho revolting custom either now or at any time past.
>
> It becomes our duty to call attention to an even worse example of ignorance, because exhibited by a parson accustomed by his ordinary pursuits to greater accuracy, both of investigation and of thought, than a mere raconteur like Mr. Hood. In the *British Medical Journal* of April 14 thia year appeared the third of the Gulstonian Lectures on "The Sterility of Women," delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in February, 1883, by J. Matthews Duncan, M.D., LL.D., &c., Phyysician-Accoucheur and Lecturer on Midwifery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of the heads of the lecture deals with the sterility alleged to be "dependent on some inscrutable incompatibility of the parties, as in Augustus and Livia, Napoleon and Josephine," after which follow certain observations which, however proper to a professional journal, would be decidedly out of place in one like our own. These directly lead up to a statement "that religion, morals, and law continue to interdict the cure that might result" from the adoption of a natural method indicated by the lecturer. And immediately afterwards comes the following assertion, infamous in its purport and astonishing in the information it conveys, which we have reluctantly felt compelled to reproduce in full: —
>
> "Unfortunately, however, among large classes – chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland – custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatibility. The practice is called bundling, or keeping company, and consists in parents permitting daughters to cohibit with an eligible man on the understanding that, if pregnancy ensues, the legal marriage tie is made. A woman an proving sterile mav be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."
>
> Now, we do not wish to characterise this as a wicked invention from first to last, because we are perfectly well aware there have been some absurd notions about that respect to the Welsh custom of "bundling," which may have had some slight substratum of fact. But what we do say, and say most emphatically, is that the custom, whenever and wherever it might have prevailed, was not the infamous thing here described. If the facts were invvestigated we unhesitatingly assert that they would disclose no more harmful a state of affairs than is witnessed in every day courtship in English or Scotch life. Indeed, if the decision were left to us, we should say that, as compared with the blue-chian and stained-glass window attitudes of those languishing youths and maidens with whom MEssrs. Gilbert and Sullivan have made us acquainted, those adopted by the Bundlers (whom we admit, for the sake of our illustration, to exist) are much the more wholesome of the two. That such an infamous imputation against the morals of Welch parents and Wlesh children should have been uttered or printed without careful inquiry into the facts is almost inconceivable. That such an abominable accusation should have been allowed to pass unchallenged would have been less conceivable still. We were therefore pleased to find the cudgles taken up with some warmth on behalf of the Welsh people by Mr. E. Rice Morgan, Morriston, who, in a letter to the editor of the *British Medical Journal*, printed in its issue of May 5, says:-
>
> WELSH MORALITY

> Sir,—

> On page 702 of your journal for the 14th instant, Dr. Matthews Duncan states this:—
>
> "Unfortunately, however, among large classes — chiefly, I am told, in Wales and some parts of Scotland – custom permits, and local morals do not interdict, a practice which produces many illustrations of this mutual incompatibility.

A woman proving sterile may be deserted by her follower, and gets another with whom the result is different."
>
> I know the habits of the Welsh well, and, thought they are far from what could be wished, there is no such practice as Dr. Duncan alludes to. To make such a statement and allow it to be printed is a gross moral blunder. I would suggest to Dr. Duncan to examone more closely into the morals of his own country. let him examine and compare the statistics of illegitimacy there and here. I should be glad to see them printed. —
>
> Youres obediently, E. RICE MORGAN.
>
> This communication attracted the notice of Dr. Dd. Thomas, Ystalyfera, who, thinking the charge made by Dr. matthews DUncan should not be allowed to remain without a further attempt at refutation, also wrote the editor a letter on the subject, but beyond an acknowledgement of its receipt no further notice was taken of it in the columns of the *British Medical Journal*. Through the courtesy of Dr. Thomas we are enabled to publish a copy of this letter. It is as follows:—
>
> TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BRITISH EMEDICAL JOURNAL."
>
> SIR,– I am glad to find my friend, Mr. E. Rice Morgan, has entered his protest against the odious and unwarrantable statement made by Dr. Matthews Duncan as to welsh morality in his address on "Sterility" as published recently in your journal (*vide* page 702, April 14).
>
> I have lived nearly all my life in Wales, and from what I know of the habits of the people I am glad of this opportunity to endorse every word that Mr. Morgan says.
>
> Between the Judge-Advocate-General (who claims to rempresent in Parlimanet the opinion of the Wesh Primcipaility) saying theat "the Welsh people hated tests more than they hated Atheists" and Dr. Duncan's infamous accusation as to the existince of "bundling" in Wales, I fear our friends beyond Offa's Dyke will credit us with a less degree of civilisation than what they have hitherto done. True, nearly all the Welsh members voted for the Bradlaugh Relief Bill; but I am satisfied that many did so more the sake of following their leader than of representing the voice of their constituents. And I fear Dr. Duncan made his reckless statement more with the view of writing a sensational paper than of putting before the public a plain statement of facts.On reading over Dr. Duncan's address, and particulalry that part of it with reference to "bundling," I could not but be struck with the recollection of a little pamphlet which appeared in Edinburgh some twenty years or more ago, called "The Mysteries of the Temple," "By an Acoolyte." This production was supposed to be a take-off on the then practice of the late Sir James Simpson; but, as it was written with little or no regard for truth, it was suppressed after but a short existence. For my own part, and for the sake of the reputation of my countrymen and countrywomen, I would be glad to find a similar fate befall Dr. Duncan's address rather than it should be the means of disseminating broadcast such erroneous statements as it contains, and thereby branding a whole nation with gross immoraility.— I remain, sir, your obedient servant, DD. THOMAS, M.D. Ystalfera, 7th May.
>
> This letter was not a wit too scathing in view of the aggravated character of the charge to which it was intended as a reply. That it was refuesed insertion may not impposibly be taken as only another instance of how very much more ready the owners of some English minds are to give currency to any scandalous rumour, no matter how flimsy and untrustworthy, concerning their Wlesh neighbours than to afford the latter a full and fiar opportunity of self-justification. Whataver the edotor of the *British Medical Journal* may have thought of Dr. Thomas's letter, we are quite sure that all Welsh people, and all right-minded English people as well, will feel thankful to the Doctor for having written it. The Duncans and ths Paxton Hoods of the country are people who must be taught that they cannot malign their neighbours, whenever it please them, with impunity.
