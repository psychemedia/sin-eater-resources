# Following the First Controversy


In the months following the flurry of correspodence that constituted the first sin-eater controversy at the end of 1875 and start of 1876, the pages fell laregly silent on the matter, although topics on folklore and various customs continued to be popular.

In the [April 12th, 1876](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2093636/6#?xywh=198%2C658%2C2797%2C1845) issue *Bye-Gones*, p43, for example, we find the fllowing column on exorcisms in Wales which derives from the Lady Verney column on *Old Welsh Legend and Poetry*:

> EXORCISM IN WALES.
>
> *(From Old Welsh Legends and Poetry in "Contemporary Review," by Lady Verney.)*
> An old clergyman at the beginning of this century made a profession of exorcism. He was once asked how he could lend himself to such superstition among his flock, and replied that he could not alter their belief which made them miserable, and that a 1 he did was to give them comfort and assistance. He then gave an account of what had once happened to himself. A farmer's wife camo to tell him that they were half ruined, every thing about their place went wrong without any cause, their fences were broken, their beasts were lamed or destroyed, their poultry died, while within the house the china came to grief, the linen was burnt; she knew they were cursed, arid entreated him to come and undo the spell. He went up to the farmhouse, which was on a lonely mountain, and desired to be left alone in the kitchen. Suddenly the poor woman rushed in to say that while she was preparing tea three tea-cups had been mysteriously broken, and the servant-girl had appeared with a goose hanging to her apron. He sat considering with his head on his hand, and then desired the girl might be sent in to him. He looked at her sternly, and said, "You know something about this." She denied it vehemently: "You want to break my character." "You had better confess," he said, solemnly; whereupon she became still more violent. At last he drew out his pocket book and began to write, If you don't tell me the truth directly I will make a pair of horns to grow out of your head." She then fell on her knees, entreating for mercy, and confessed that a neighbour, anxious to get the farm, had bribed her to do ail the mischief possible in order to induce the owners to believe themselves bewitched and to leave the place. The clergyman made her promise that nothing of the kind should ever happen again; if it did, he said, he would make the horns grow instantly. He then went out and told the farmer he had uncursed the place, and all went on rightly from that time; but he had never revealed the reason until that moment.
>
> In another case a clergyman, celebrated for exorcisms, was sent for to a house haunted by the devil close to the sea-shore. He went and spent three night3 there alone, after which he announced that he had done the deed, "but that the devil was the hardest he had ever had to deal with." He never would reveal what took place. It was probably some smuggling transaction. He died rich, as he was well paid for such operations.

Towards the end of 1876, a "new comer" to Cardiff enquired of the readers of the Western Mail in the edition of [November 20th, 1876](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4344887/4344890/8/), p3, to what extent ancient burial and marriage customs prevailed, including that of the sin-eater, but their appeal seems to fall on deaf ears:

> BURIAL CUSTOMS IN WALES. TO THE EDITOR.
>
> Sir ,— Is there among the numerous intelligent correspondents of the *Western Mail* one who can inform me to what extent the ancient burial and marriage customs of the Welsh still prevail? I allude particularly to the customs of watching over the dead in the manner called by the Irish "waking" – the placing of salt on the breast of the corpse, and the performance of the sin eater. I am told that these customs were still prevalent in Carmarthenshire, and other like neighbourhoods strongly Welsh, within a few years back. Do they still prevail ? A late number of the *Dublin University Magazine* represented the customs of this kind in Yorkshire as being only just extinct. No doubt your correspondents in Carmarthenshire could enlighten me as regards the same here; or the learned "Morien" might consent to devote a paragraph or two to the subject, which is full of interest to readers who have come to Wales from other parts. The bidding to weddings I believe is still practised in some sections, and the galloping to church may be also, but of this I have not heard. NEW COMER. Cardiff, Nov. 17.

There do not appear to have been any replies.

In Notes and Queries, [Vol 9 Iss 212, dated January 19th, 1878](https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1878-01-19_9_212/page/3/mode/2up), p48, a query on the matter of customs surrounding "bread and salt" appears:

> Bread and Salt.
>
> Some years since I call for the first time upon Canon Percy, of Carlisle, at his residence there. When refreshment had been offered and declined, he said, "You must have some bread and salt," with some remarks to imply that it was the way to establish a friendship. These were then brought in and eaten, without anything to lead one to suppose that this was an unusual custom at the house. Was this a practic peculiar to himself or to his family? or is such custom prevalent in the North, or in any other part of England? I have not met with it else-where.
>
> Ed. Marshall, F.S.A

Although this does not directly relate to the ritual that was often described in a sin-eater context, I wonder if we might not co-opt this sotry to create a fictional sin-eater tale of our own involving a priest who takes various sincs unto himself, but then passes them on to his unkowing parishioners!

# A Minor Skirmish, Eddowe's Journal, 1878-9

Discussion around the tradition thus appears to have fallen back into obscurity. In the summer of 1878, a short piece appeared in the [August 14th, 1878](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001502/18780814/092/0006) edition of *Eddowes's Shrewsbury Journal*, that restated the observations of Bagford's letter, but it drew no immediate response:

> SIN EATERS.
>
> An usage called sin eating (see Hosea iv. 8) undoubtedly arose in Roman Catholic times, and, however it may have been limited to the clergy in early ages, was afterwards continued, and practised as profession, certain persons called sin eaters. In letter from John Bagford, dated 1715, printed in *Leland's Collectanea*, there is the following account of sin eater:— "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire in those villages adjoining to Wales when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him groat which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread which ate; and a full bowl of ale which drank off at a draught. After this he got from the cricket, and pronounced with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul." Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum are statements, in Aubrey's own handwriting, to the same purport.
>
> Boileau

Several months later, in an issue of the same periodical, and dated Christmas Day, [December 25th, 1878](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001502/18781225/131/0006), p6, the same author picks up the tale again with an ostensible correction:

> SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PATCHES.
>
> SIN EATERS (August 14, 1878).
>
> In a former article on this subject I spoke of the practice as having arisen in Roman Catholic times, this statement I have to modify, for I read, in Canon Kingsley's *Health and Education* p. 224. thus— Plato speaks of lower grade of Orphic priests, Orpheotelestai, who used to come before the doors of the rich and promise by sacrifice and expiatory songs release them from their own sins and those of their forefathers, and such (the Canon says) would be but too likely to get a hearing from the man who was afraid of a weasel or an owl." Superstition has a far-reaching pedigree. A similar practice, initiated by Orphic priests, is continued by ignorant Papists (who servilely copied most if not all of the follies of paganism), and is found existing in Shropshire villages in the 18th century. Alas! poor human nature !
>
> Boileau.

This note attracted an immediate reply in the following New Year's Day issue, dated [January 1st, 1879](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001502/18790101/127/0006), a short, teasing response that requests more direct evidence of the sin-eating tradition:

> SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PASTURES
>
> SIN EATERS (25 December. 1878). Can "Boileau" give any proof of the truth of his assertion that Sin Eating existed in Shropshire in the eighteenth century ? Can he name single place in the county where it was practised either in the eighteenth, or any other century ? Until he does, Shropshire Sin Eating must be regarded myth.
>
> Proud Salopian.

*Boileau* responds later that month, in the edition of [January 29th, 1878](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001502/18790129/097/0006)

> SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PASTURES
>
> SIN EATERS (January 1st, 1879). "Proud Salopian" asks (January 1st, 1879) for proof respecting this practice.

As provenance, they cite their original correspondence describing the tradition (which cites Bagford's letter in *Leland's Collectanea*):

> If he will refer to *Shreds and Patches* of Ang. 14th. last year, he will see what authority I relied on.

as well as providing a perhaps more convenient reference in the guise of the 1813 edition of Brand's *Popular Antiquities*:

> In Brand’s *Popular Antiquities* vol ii., p. 155-6, quarto edition of 1813, he will find all the proof which can be given ; and Bagford adds, "How can a man think otherwise of this than that it proceeded from the ancient Heathens?"

*Boileau* then includes the Aubrey quote, with which we are increasingly familiar:

```{admonition} Boileau, quoting Aubrey
:class: dropdown

> Aubrey further remarks. "In the county of Hereford was an old Custome at Funeralls hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskal) I remember lived in Cottage Rosse high-way The manner was that when the Corps waa brought out of the House and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of Beer (which he was to drink up), and Sixpence in money: in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This Custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape Goate in the old Lawe— Levit. chap xvi , v 21. 22. 'And Aaron shall lay,' &c. This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government; as at Dynder (*volens nolens*, the Parson of the Parish) the Kindred Woman deceased there had this punctually performed according to her Will: and, also, the like was done at the City of Hereford in those times, where a Woman kept, many yeares before her death, a Mazard Bowle for the Sinne-Eater; and the like in other places in this Countie: as also in Brecon (a). I believe Custom was heretofore used all over Wales (b)
>
> "(a) E.g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin. the Minister, about 1640. could not hinder the performance of this ancient Custome.
>
> '(b) MS. Lansd, 226, fol. 116.' In another page. Mr. Aubrey says:— “A.D. 1686 This Custom is used this day in North Wales, where milk seems to have been the substitute for beer."
```

Additional details are also hinted at courtesy of Pennant, also described in Brand's *Popular Antiquities*:

> In the same book. Brand's *Popular Antiquities* p 193, I note there is farther account of this custom from Pennant's MS. relative to North Wales.
>
> Boileau.

Unfortunately, this does not satisfy *Proud Salopian*, who in their letter in the following edition, of [February 5th, 1879](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001502/18790205/144/0006) is keen to learn of a more contemporary description of the tradition:

> SALOPIAN SHREDS AND PASTURES
>
> SIN EATERS (29 January, 1879)
>
> Boileau stated that the custom of Sin Eating was practised in Shropshire the eighteenth century, and I asked him to mention any place in the county where it ever obtained. He is evidently unable to this, and has to seek instances in Herefordshire and Wales. The charge against Shropshire is, therefore, clearly "not proven."
>
> Proud Salopian.

Thus far, I have been unable to find any signs of a further response from *Boileau*.

## British Goblins

Towards the end of 1879, reviews started to appear for a new book on "Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends and Traditions" in the form of [*Britsh Goblins*](https://archive.org/details/britishgoblinswe00sikeuoft), which appears to have had a publication date of 1880, by the Hon. Wirt Sykes.

> LITERATURE.
>
> BRITISH GOBLINS  Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends and Traditions; by the Hon. Wirt Sykes, United States Consul for Wales. London, Sampson Low & Co.
>
> THIS is, to us, one of the most attractive books of the season. Not only has Mr. Sykes carefully culled from published sources —such as Peter Roberts's Cambrian Antiquities, Jones's "Apparations,""Cymru Fu," "Cambro Briton," "Bye-gones" "Archaeologia Cambrensis" all that relates to his subject, but he has gone about amongst the people of South Wales for himself, and taken down from the lips of the elders there old stories of bye-gone customs and once prevalent superstitions. May be that the author places too much confidence in some of those narratives; whether he does or not, they add greatly to the interest of his book, and readers can judge for themselves how much to put under the head of "national superstitions," and how much to the credit merely of the foolish fancies of the narrators. We are glad to see that Mr. Sykes has investigated the "Sin Eater" fable. We don't believe an instance of this practice was ever proved to have been observed in Wales, or Shropshire either, and the author, after giving all the "illustrations" he can gather, says:-
>
> "Such is the testimony. I venture no opinion upon it further than may be conveyed in the remark that I cannot find any direct corroboration of it. I have not only seen no reference to it in Welsh writings, but I have never met with any unlettered Welshman who had ever heard of it."

[The review then goes on to cover other matters covered in the work.]

Folk lore: or, superstitious beliefs in the west of Scotland within this century
1879-12-17
, p60-62

> DEATH
>
> After death there came a new class of superstitious fears and practices. The clock was stopped, the looking- glass was covered with a cloth, and all domestic animals were removed from the house until after the funeral These things were done, however, by many from old custom, and without their knowing the reason why such things were done. Originally the reason for the exclusion of dogs and cats arose from the belief that, if either of these animals should chance to leap over the corpse, and be afterwards permitted to live, the devil would gain power over the dead person.
>
> When the corpse was laid out, a plate of salt was placed upon the breast, ostensibly to prevent the body swelling. Many did so in this belief, but its original purpose was to act as a charm against the devil to prevent him from disturbing the body. In some localities the plate of salt was supplemented with another filled with earth. A symbolical meaning was given for this ; that the earth represented the corporeal body, the earthly house, — the salt the heavenly state of the soul. But there was an older superstition which gave another explanation for the plate of salt on the breast. There were persons calling themselves "*sin eaters*" who, when a person died, were sent for to come and eat the sins of the deceased. When they came, their *modus operandi* was to place a plate of salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse, and repeat a series of incantations, after which they ate the contents of the plates, and so relieved the dead person of such sins as would have kept him hovering around his relations, haunting them with his imperfectly purified spirit, to their great annoyance, and without satisfaction to himself. This form of superstition has evidently a close relation to such forms of ancestor-worship as we know were practised by the ancients, and to which reference has already been made.
>
> Until the funeral, it was the practice for some of the relations or friends to sit up all night, and watch the corpse. In my young days this duty was generally undertaken by youtiis, male and female friends, who volunteered their services; but these watchings were not accompanied by the unseemly revelries which were common in Scotland in earlier times, or as are still practised in Ireland. The company sitting up with the corpse generally numbered from two to six, although I have myself been one of ten. They went to the house about ten in the evening, and before the relations went to bed each received a glass of spirits ; about midnight there was a refreshment of tea or ale and bread, and the same in the morning, when the relations of the deceased relieved the watchers. Although during these night sittings nothing ubbefitting the solemnity of the occasion was done, the circumstances of the meeting gave opportunity for love-making. The first portion of the night was generally passed in reading, — some one reading aloud for the benefit of the company, afterwards they got to story-telling, the stories being generally of a ghostly description, producing such a weird feeling, that most of the company durst hardly look behind them for terror, and would start at the slightest noise. I have seen some so affected by this fear that they would not venture to the door alone if the morning was dark. These watchings of the dead were no doubt efficacious in perpetuating superstitious ideas.
>
> The reasons given for watching the corpse differed in different localities. The practice is still observed, I believe, in some places ; but probably now it is more the result of habit — a custom followed without any basis of definite belief, and merely as a mark of respect for the dead ; but in former times, and within this century, it was firmly held that if the corpse were not watched, the devil would carry off the body, and many stories were current of such an awful result having happened One such story was told me by a person who had received the story from a person who was present at the wake where the occurrence happened. I thus got it at second hand. The story ran as follows ; — The corpse was laid out in a room, and the watchers had retired to another apartment to partake of refreshments, having shut the door of the room where the corpse lay. While they were eating there was heard a great noise, as of a struggle between two persons, proceeding from the room where the corpse lay. None of the party would venture into the room, and in this emergency they sent for the minister, who came, and, with the open Bible in his hand, entered the room and shut the door. The noise then ceased, and in about ten minutes he came out, lifted the tongs from the fireplace, and again re-entered the room. When he came out again, he brought out with the tongs a glove, which was seen to be bloody, and this he put into the fire. He refused, however, to tell either what he had seen or heard; but on the watchers returning to their post, the corpse lay as formerly, and as quiet and unruffled as if nothing had taken place, whereat they were all surprised.

> British Goblins, Welsh Folk Lore, Fairy Mythology% Legends, and Traditions. By Wirt Sikes, United Statel Consul for Wales. (London Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, Fleet-street). It has been known for several months past that Mr. Wirt Sikes. who has written so much about Wales and its people in the American magazines, was engaged upon an important work treating of a most picturesque side of Welsh character. This work is now before us, in a handsome volume of 428 p.p. illustrated with several drawings full of life and movement from the pencil of a Welsh artist, Mr. T. H. Thomas. The scope of the volume is clearly indicated to sell by its title, given above. It is evidently the result of long study of Welsh literature, and of patient inquiry among the Welsh peasantry. It is divided into four books, entitled respectively "The Realm of Fasrie," "The Spirit World," "Quaint Old Customs." and "Bells, Wells, Stones, and Dragons." It is impossible in the limits at our disposal to do justice to a work of this character, but it may in general be said to cover the field of folk- lore somewhat exhaustively. While not intended to to deal with the legends of the Arthurian period, these are often and gracefully referred to for purposes of interesting comparison with what the author terms the "humble goblins," of Welsh fireside tails—th" fairies, ghosts, superstitious customs, and cromlech-hunting elves. Fairies are classified in five divisions, thus: Ellyllon. or elves: Coblynau, or mine fairies: Bwbachod, or household fairies Gwragedd Annwn, or fairies of the lakes and streams; and Gwyllion, or mountain fairies. Numberless fairy tales are told, either as taken down from the lips of the peasantry with whom the author has conversed in his rambles about the Princi- pality, or translated from rare and curious old Welsh volumes. As an example of the latter, taken almost at random, we may quote the following Once more this legend appears, this time with a feature I have nowhere else encountered in fairy land, to wit, the father of a fairy damsel. The son of a farmer on Drws Coed Farm was, one fogey day, looking after his father's sheep, when crossing a marshy meadow he beheld a little lady behind some rising ground. She had yellow hair, blue eyes, and rosy cheeks. He approached her, and asked permi-sion to converse whereupon she smiled sweetly and said to him, Idol of my hopes, you have come at last I" They there and then begun to "keep company," and met each other rh,i]y here and there along the farm meadows. His intentions were honourable he desired her to marry him He was sometimetl absent for days together, no one knew where, and his friends whi-pered about that he had been witched. Around the Turf Lake (Llyn y Dyw. rc'ueni was a grove of trees, and under one of these one day fairy promised to be his. The consent of her father was now necessary. One moonlight night an appointment was made to meet in this wood. The father and daughter did not appear till the moon had dis- appeared behind the hill. Then they both came. The fiiry father immediately gave his consent to the marriage, (HI one condition, namely, that her future husband should never hit her with iron. If ever thou dost touch her flesh with iron she shall be no more thine. but she shnll return to her own." They were married—a good-looking pair. Large sums of money were brought by her. the night before she we idinsr. to Drw Coed. The shepherd lad became wealthy, had several luwàsome children, and they were very haopy. After some years, they were one day out riding, when her horse funk in a deep mire, and by the assistance of her husband, in her hurry to remount, she was struck on her knee by the stirrup of the saddle. Immediately voices were heard singing' on the brow of the hill, and she disappeared, leaving- all her children be- hind. She and her mother devised a plan by wh eh she could see her beloved, but as she was not allowed to walk the earth wiih man, they floated a large turf on the lake, and on this turf she stood for hours at a time holding converse with her husband. continued until his death. In Book II., "The Spirit World," the author has managed to bring together a collection of the most blood-freezing ghost stories that we have ever had the pleasure of coming across. We have little doubt this will be with many readers the most popular part < .f the book. The ghosts are also regularly classified, and comparisons drawn between these and like creature of popular fancy in other lands. The chapters on death- omens are especially absorbing, delineating the peculiari- ties of the corpse candle, the yicarch yrhHyyn, the U.lucth, the teidu, or goblin funeral, and many others. It is on this head observed— That these various portents are extensively believed in at the present day there cannot be a doubt; with regard to the most important of them. I am able to testify with the fullest freedom; I have heard regarding them story after story, from the lips of narrators whose incerity wa expressed vividly in face, tone. and behaviour. The excited eye, the pai n? cheek, the bated breath, the sinking voice, the intense and absorbed manner—familiar phenomena in every circle where ghost storie are toJd-{>i¡]cllced the perfect sincerity, a least, cl the speakers. It is unueccessary here to repeat, what I for my own prt never foreet, nor, I trust, does the re&0(>r, that Wales is no exception to the rest of the world in itscredniity. That it is more picturesque is true, and it is also true that there is here an unusual amount of legend which has not hitherto found its way into books. A pleasant change of subject is found in the Third Book," where a large number of quaint old customs are described. The sin-eater, custom long associated with Wales by writers in this field, is treated off at some length, and the evidence pro and con regarding it care- fully collated. It is evident that Mr. Wirt Sikes, in the true spirit of scientific inquiry, has no preco: calved theory to establish, and he frankly says he can find no evidence that there ever was such a custom in Wales. The subject has engaged my attention from the first moment I set foot on Cambrian soil, and I have not only seen no reference to it in Welsh writings, but I have never met any unlettered Welshman who had never heard of it. "Concerning the custom of bundling (courting a-bed), on the other hand, his testimony is that it is still practised in certain rural neighbourhoods of Wales. He adds "It is only by breathing the very atmosphere of an existance whose primitive influences we may thus ourselves feel, that we can get a just conception of underlying forces which govern a custom like this. Of course it is sternly con- demned by every advanced moralist, t-ven in the neighbourhoods where it prevails." An instance of bundling is given which came to the author's know- ledge so lately as 1877. In this connection he pertinently recalls certain laws of the ancient Brit"ns regarding courtship, which were so severe that" any other issue to courtship than marriage was practically impossible." Many of the quaint old customs in Wales, our author tells us, while they "appear to be meaning- less, to people of average culture, are in truth replete with meaning:" However trivial they may seem, they are very seldom the offspring of mere fooling. The student of comparative folk- lore is oftel1 able to trace their origin with surprising dis- tinctness, anù to evolve from them a significance before UB- suspected. In many cases these customs are traced to the primeval mythology. Others are clearly seen to be of Druidical origin. Many spring from the rites Rnd 01)':r. -uœs of the Roman Catholic Church in the early days of Chris- tianity on Welsh soil—where, as is now generally conceded- the Gospel was first preached in Great Britain. Som", em- body historical traditions, and wme are the outgrowth of peculiar states of ociety in medieval times, DJreciJy ;>- j: directly, they are all associated with superstition, though in many instances they have quite lost any superstitous charac- ter in our day. Among those which the author considers to be of Papal origin, but which have now no moral significance is the following :— Among Twelfth Night customs none is more cp; ,hr.l7>:>d than that called Mary Lwyd. It prevails in various parts of Wales, notably in Lower Glamorganshire. The skeleton of a horse's head is procured by the young men or boys of a village, and adorned with "favour-" of pink, blue, yellow, &c. These are generally borrowed from the girls, as it is not considered necessary the silken fillets and rosettes should be new, and such finery costs money. The bottoms of two black bottles are inserted in the sockets of the skeleton head to serve as eyes, and a substitute for ears is also contrived. On Twelfth Night they ca-rry this object about from house to house, with shouts and songs, and a general cultivation of noise and racket. Sometimes a duet is sung in Welsh, outside a door, the singers begging to be invited in; if the door be not opened they tap on it, and there is frequently quite a series of awen sung, the parties within denying the outsiders admission, and the outsiders urging the same. At last the door is opened, when in bounces the merry crowd, them the Mary Lwyd, borne by oue personating a hor-e, who is led by another personating the groom. The horse chases the girls around the room, capering and neighing, whil.: the groom cries, "So ho, my boy—gently, poor felJow:" and Le girls, of course, scream with merriment. A dance foil ,ws—a reel, performed by three young men, tricked eut with The company is then regaled with cakes and ale, and tue- revellers depart, pausing outside the door to sing a parting song of thanks and good wishes to their entertainers. British Goblins is evidently the work of an author well versed in the folk-lore of other countries, especially in that of Germany and Scandinavia. The copious in- dex at the end of the volume, and the lists of contents before each chapter, add much to the usefulness of the book. It is dedicated, most appropriately, to the Prince of Wales, and its popularity in Wales is certain to be great—not because all the author's views will be entirely agreed with, but because of the amount of information it affords on many subjects hitherto little known, the deeply interesting materials of which it is composed and the sympathetic and generous appreciation of aj that is best in the Welsh character which Mr. Wirt Sikes has so constantly displayed in his literary work.
