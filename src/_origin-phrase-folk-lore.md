# The Origins of "Folk-Lore"

Before we start on our journey in search of the sin-eater, it is worth setting the scene. Today, we would probably identify the field of study associated with such an ambition as that of folklore, or folklore studies, the study of traditional culture by way of cultural artifacts, behaviours and language. But in the mid-19th century, *folk lore* (or variously, *folk-lore*, *folklore* etc.) had, as a word, or phrase, only recently been coined. So what is the folk history of the term, and how might we explain whatever degree of popularity it had as an area of study, in 19th century Britain?

The tale, and two related one, centers around a singular individual, William John Thoms. For it was he who coined not only the phrase, but also went on to found *Notes & Queries*, a publication we shall have course to refer to many times throughout our journey, as well as playing a foundational role in the founding of the Folklore Society. So let us start with a brief history of this singular individual.

## William Thoms, "Folk-Lore" and *Notes and Queries*

https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Thoms,_William_John

wikipedia - In 1845, he was appointed Clerk to the House of Lords, and subsequently Deputy Librarian at the House of Lords Library. In 1849, he founded the quarterly journal Notes and Queries, which for some years he also edited.Thoms is credited with inventing the term "folklore" in an 1846 letter to the Athenaeum.[2] He invented this compound word to replace the various other terms used at the time, including "popular antiquities" or "popular literature". He was fond of the works of Jacob Grimm, which he considered remarkable.

Folk-Lore, the Lore of the People

Your pages have so often given evidence of the interest which you take in what we in England designate as Popular Antiquities, or Popular Literature (though by-the-bye it is more a Lore than a Literature, and would be most aptly described by a good Saxon com-pound, Folk-Lore, the Lore of the People)— that I am not without hopes of enlisting your aid in garnering the few ears which are remaining, scattered over that field from which our forefathers might have gathered a goodly crop.

No one who has made the manners, customs, observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, &c., of the olden time his study, but must have arrived at two conclusions :- the first, how much that is curious and interesting in these matters is now entirely lost —the second, how much may yet be rescued by timely exertion. What Hone endeavoured to do in his "Every-Day Book," &c., the *Athenaeum*, by its wider circulation, may accomplish ten times more effectually- gather together the infinite number of minute facts, illustrative of the subject I have mentioned, which are scattered over the memories of its thousands of readers, and preserve them in its pages, until some James Grimm shall arise who shall do for the Mythology of the British Islands the good service which that profound antiquary and philologist has accomplished for the Mythology of Germany. The present century has scarcely produced a more remarkable book, imperfect as its learned author confesses it to be, than the second edition of the _"Deutsche Mythologie"_ and, what is it?- a mass of minute facts, many of which, when separately considered, appear trifling and insignificant,—but, when taken in connexion with the system into which his master-mind has woven them, assume a value that of he who first recorded them never dreamed of attributing to them.

How many such facts would one word from you evoke, from the north and from the south_from John o'Groat's to the Land's End! How many readers would be glad to show their gratitude for the novelties which you, from week to week, communicate to them, by forwarding to you some record of old Time --some recollection of a now neglected custom, some fading legend, local tradition, or fragmentary ballad !

Nor would such communications be of service to the English antiquary alone. The connexion between the Folk-Lore of England (remember I claim the honour of introducing the epithet Folk-Lore, as Disraeli does of introducing Father-Land, into the literature of this country) and that of Germany is so intimate that such communications will probably serve to enrich some future edition of Grimm's Mythology.

Let me give you an instance of this connexion.- In one of the chapters of Grimm, he treats very fully of the parts which the Cuckoo plays in Popular Mythology of the prophetic character with which it has been invested by the voice of the people; and gives many instances of the practice of deriving predictions from the number of times which its song is heard. He also records a popular notion, "that the Cuckoo never sings till he has thrice eaten his fill of cherries." Now, I have lately been informed of a custom which formerly obtained among children in Yorkshire, that illustrates the fact of a connexion between the Cuckoo and the Cherry,—and that, too, in their prophetic attributes. A friend has communicated to me that children in Yorkshire were formerly (and may be still) accustomed to sing round a cherry-tree the following invocation :-

Cuckoo, Cherry-tree,  
Come down and tell me  
How many years I have to live.

Each child then shook the tree, and the number of cherries which fell betokened the years of its future life.

The Nursery Rhyme which I have quoted, is, I am aware, well known. But the manner in which it was applied is not recorded by Hone, Brande, or Ellis:—and is one of those facts, which, trifling in themselves, become of importance when they form links in a great chain-one of those facts which a word from the Athenæum would gather in abundance for the use of future inquirers into that interesting branch of literary antiquities, our Folk-Lore.

Ambrose Merton

P.S._ It is only honest that I should tell you I have long been contemplating a work upon our *Folk-Lore* (under that *title*, mind Messrs. A, B, and C- so do not try to forestall me);—and I am personally interested in the success of the experiment which I have, in this letter, albeit imperfectly, urged you to undertake.

We have taken some time to weigh the suggestion of our correspondent-desirous to satisfy ourselves that any good of the kind which he proposes could be effected in such space as we are able to spare from the many other demands upon our columns and having before our eyes the fear of that shower of trivial communication which a notice in conformity with his suggestion is too likely to bring. We have finally decided that, if our antiquarian correspondents be earnest and well-informed, and subject their com- munications to the condition of having something worthy to communicate, we may - now that the several antiquarian societies have brought their meet-ings, for the season, to a close—at once add to the amusement of a large body of our readers and be the means of effecting some valuable salvage for the future historian of old customs and feelings, within a compass that shall make no unreasonable encroachment upon our columns. With these views, however, we must announce to our future contributors under the above head, that their communications will be subjected to a careful sifting—both as regards value, authenticity, and novelty; and that they will save both themselves and us much unnecessary trouble if they will refrain from offering any facts or speculations which do not at once need recording and deserve it. Brevity will be always a recommendation, where there are others; and great length in any article will, necessity, exclude it, even where its merits would recommend. The cases will be very rare in which an article should exceed a couple of our columns,—and the exception can be only when the article itself will bear dividing without injury. But notices much shorter will always be more welcome ;—and, in fact, extent will be, on all occasions, an important element in our estimate of the admissibility of a communication. We will hint, also, to our correspondents, that we should, in each case, prefer receiving (though we do not make it absolute as a rule,) the confidential communication of the writer's real name and address.

Folk-Lore
Bartholomew Tide

I do not know that I can better show my gratitude for the insertion in last Saturday's *Athenaeum* of my letter inviting you to receive, and your country readers to furnish, communications on the subject of our 'Folk-Lore,' than by indicating to "intending" correspondents some points connected with our Popular Mythology and Observances, respecting which new facts and existing traditions might prove of considerable value.

I would observe, in the first place, that, as the Fairy Mythology of England, as preserved to us in the writings of Shakspeare (its best and most beautiful expositor), exhibits a striking intermixture of Celtic and Teutonic elements, all local traditions respecting that mystic race,—whether

*Of elves, of hills, brooks, standing lakes, or groves, —*

will be useful in developing the influence which such elements respectively exercised upon this poetical branch of our Popular Mythology. And as I agree with Mr. Keightley no mean authority on such a subject-in opinion "that the belief in Fairies is by no means extinct in England,—and that in districts, if there be any such, where steam-engines, cotton mills, mail coaches `[This was written, by Mr. Keightley, in 1828 ; but now, now, what Chaucer said of the "elves" may almost be applied to the mails. "But now can no man see non *mails* mo."`], and similar exorcists have not yet penetrated, numerous legends might be collected," — I am not without hope of seeing many "a roundel and a fairy song" rescued from destruction through the agency of the *Athenaeum*.

Can no Devonshire correspondent furnish new and untold stories of his native Pixies? Are there no records of a fairy pipe-manufactory to be gathered at Swinborne, in Worcestershire ?-In the mining and mountainous districts of Derbyshire are all "such antique fables and such fairy toys" entirely extinct ? - If so, is not the neighbourhood of Haddon, or of both, still visited by the coach drawn by headless steeds, driven by a coachman as headless as themselves ?-Does not such an equipage still haunt the mansion of Parsloes, in Essex?—and could not some correspondent from that county furnish you with stories of the inhabitants of Coggeshall, to prove them very rivals of the Wise Men of Gotham ?—Is the Barguest no longer seen in Yorkshire ?-Is "howdening" altogether obsolete in Kent- and, if so, when was this last trace of a heathen rite performed ?-Are the legends of Tregeagle no longer current in Cornwall ?-_These are all subjects not undeserving attention : and it should be remembered that legends and traditions which are considered trifling, in the localities to which they more immediately relate, assume an interest in the eyes of strangers to whom they are not familiar—and an importance when placed in apposition with cognate materials, by the light which they both receive and furnish from such juxtaposition.

There is another matter, too, on which local information is much to be desired while it is still attainable. I mean the "Feasts" which are still annually celebrated in the more remote parts of the country; many of which are, doubtless, of very considerable antiquity-even as old as the days of Heathenism. This is a branch of our Popular Antiquities which—to use a happy phrase of Horace Walpole's -has not yet been "tapped" in England ; one which can now be thoroughly and properly investigated only by ascertaining, in each case, the following particulars, among others: the day on which the Feast is held; the peculiar observances by which it is accompanied, and— which will serve, in some measure, to illustrate the history of the climate in this country, and (strange combination !) the progress of social improvement—the peculiar dishes which are usually introduced on such festivals.

I ought to apologize for thus occupying so much of your space: but, as you have kindly consented, at my request, to open your pages to contributions on the subject of our · 'Folk-Lore,' I thought it might be of advantage to point out to correspondents some matters respecting which communications would be both valuable and acceptable. 

AMBROSE MERTON

The Epithet 'Old Scratch.'

Of that huge mass of imperfectly digested materials which may be said to constitute the text book of the students of our English 'Folk-Lore,' Brand's 'Popular Antiquities,' there is no chapter more imperfect, and consequently more unsatisfactory, than that entitled 'Popular Notions concerning the Apparition of the Devil.'

In this chapter,-after some allusion to the names "Old Nick," "Old Harry," "Old Scratch,"  "The Old One,"—Brand observes :—"The epithet 'old' to so many of his titles seems to favour the common opinion, that the Devil can only appear in the shape of an old man."—It may, however, be doubted whether the epithet "old" has not, in this case, been derived from the Early Latin Fathers; who frequently use the expression, "Antiquus hostis," when speaking of the Enemy of mankind. In this way, the Anglo-Saxon, Caedmon, speaks of "*se* ealda deofol,"—"se ealda," "the Old Devil," "the Old One;" and in North Friesland, the same epithet, "*de ual duivel*," still obtains. *Gammel* Erik (Old Erik) is a title bestowed upon the Devil by the Danes ; and in this *Old Erik* we have, probably, the origin of our "Old Harry." In the old Norse, "Kölski"—which signifies both "senex" and "diabolus"-is the epithet by which the "foul fiend" is usually designated.

Again, though the epithet "Scratch" is, by modern usage, exclusively applied to his Satanic Majesty, such was not its original application. In the old High German monuments, mention is made of a small elfish sprite, *Scrat*, or *Scrato*,-by Latin writers translated Pilosus ; as Waltschrate, or Wood Scrat, is Satyrus. In the 'Vocabularius' of 1482 we find Schretlin (penates). Nacht-schrettele (Ephialtes). The Anglo-Saxon Schritta (Hermaphroditus), and the Old Norse Skratti (malus genius, gigas), are also clearly allied to this elfish Being.

Grimm describes the *Schrat* as resembling in its nature the Latin Faun, and the Greek Satyr, -the 'Sylvanus' of Livy; and the Schratlein as being a domestic spirit more resembling the German Wichtel and Alp. The Schrat is never represented as a female ; and differs from the Elf as appearing only singly-not in hosts.

The reader of the third volume of the 'Fairy Legends of the South of Ireland'-which contains a translation of the Brothers Grimm's 'Essay on the Irish Legends' — will , doubtless, remember the very curious old German poem there translated, in which the nature of the Schretel or Schrat is fully described. The manner in which the sprite encounters a huge white bear, by whom it is worsted in the contest,-in consequence of which the house is freed from its intrusion,-is told with considerable humour ; and will give the reader a satisfactory notion of the malicious spirit who has been despoiled of his name, for the purpose of enriching the abundant nomenclature in which Old Scratch-as the Devil is now improperly designated— already rejoices.

THE FOLK-LORE OF SHAKSPEARE. By William Thoms.

[Those readers of the Atheneum who take an interest in our English " Folk-Lore" `[We may be permitted to express some satisfaction at the universal adoption of this name— invented by our correspondent Ambrose Merton. In less than twelve months it has almost attained to the dignity of a "household word."]` will, doubtless, remember that the articles so entitled which have from time to time appeared in these columns were evoked by an intimation that "communications on such subjects from earnest and well-informed correspondents" would be welcome. They may remember, too, that such intimatio was given at the suggestion of a correspondent signing himself "Ambrose Merton;" who, in solicitng the aid of the *Athenaeum* for preserving the infinite number of minute facts illustrative of this branch of antiquarian learning scattered over the memories of its many readers, confessed to a personal interest to the success of his appeal— on the ground of his having long contemplated a work in connexion with English Folk-Lore.

That correspondent was the present writer; and the work to which he referred was one in which he proposed to make the writings of Shakspeare and that Folk-Lore which the poet loved mutually illustrative of each other. The papers under the above special heading which may from time to time appear in our columns, are fragments of that attempt to throw a light over the writings of the Poet of the People from the side of our popular literature, customs and superstitions.]

Folk Lore.—When and by whom was this word introduced into the English language? In Latham's *Dictionary* the earliest example given is dated 1852—the form is "folks-lore." Folk-lore was certainly used some years before that date in *The Athenaeum*, and if gossip is not wrong we owe this useful and popular word to a scholar well known to the readers of "N.& Q." The word promises to have many relatives— " folk- song, " " folk-speech " are taking the place of the older phrases.

"We may be pardoned for here mentioning the fact that it was when inviting assistance in the preservation of our old superstition and mythology, that Mr. Thoms first made public the word 'folk-lore,' to designate the subjects of popular belief and knowledge. The word was at once caught up and adopted in England and on the Continent, and few would now believe that the term never existed until Mr. Thoms made use of it in the Athenaeum of 22nd August, 1846."

Origin of the Word "Folk-Lore"

I am greatly indebted to W. E. A. A. for giving me an opportunity of putting on record in "N. & Q." how I was led to the coinage of this now universally recognized word. For I may say, as Coriolanus said of the fluttering of the Volscians, "Alone I did it."

Popular antiquities and superstition, and the relation of national legends and traditions to one another, had long been a subject of great interest to me— an interest greatly fostered by the perusal of Grimm's *Deutsche Mytholigie*. Some time after the appearance of the second edition of that masterly work, ] began to put in order the notes which I had been collecting for years, with a view to their publication ; and feeling sure that the Iron Horse then beginning to ride roughshod over every part of the country would soon trample under foot and exterminate all traces of our old beliefs, legends, &d., I besought *The Athenaeum* to lend its powerful influence towards their collection and preservation.

My kind friend, Mr. Dilke, most readily fell into my views. The subject was "tapped" (as Horace Walpole would say) in that journal on the 22nd August, 1846, in a paper written by myself under the pseudonym of Amprose Merton, and headed Foik-Lore.

In the opening of that appeal, I described the subject as "what we in England designate as popular antiquities, or popular literature (though, by-the-bye, it is more a Lore than a Literature, and would be most aptly described by a good Saxon compound, Folk-Lore—the Lore of the People)."

When seeking to prove that the object I had in view would not be of service to English antiquaries only, I added :—

"The connexion between the Folk-Lore of England (mind, I claim the honour of introducing the epithet Folk-Lore, as Disraeli did of introducing Father-Land, into the literature of this country) and that of Germany is so intimate that such communications will probably serve to enrich some future edition of Grimm's Mythology."

And my communication closed with the following postscript, in which, with a precaution which was subsequently justified, I reiterated my claim :—

"It is only honest that I should tell you that I have long been contemplating a work upon our *Folk-Lore* (under that title, mind, Messrs. A, B, and C, so do not try to forestall me), and I am personally interested in the success of the experiment, which I have in this letter, albeit imperfectly, urged you to undertake."

The word took its place, for it supplied a want ; and when Dean Trench's *English Past and Present* appeared (1855), I was pleased to find one so qualified to judge of the value of the word speaking of it as follows :—

"The most successful of these compounded words (borrowed recently from the German} is 'Folk-lore,' and the substitution of this for the long and latinized 'Popular Superstitions' must be deemed, I think, an unquestionable gain."

The impression that the word was borrowed from the German is a very natural one. But should the Archbishop of Dublin ever see this note, I am sure that accomplished scholar will in future editions of his book do justice to the English origin of the word Folk-lore.

William J. Thoms.

Ethnology in folklore
by Gomme, George Laurence, 1853-1916

1892

p.v-viii

Preface

I HAVE sought in this book to ascertain and set forth the principles upon which folklore may be classified, in order to arrive at some of the results which should follow from its study. That it contains ethnological elements might be expected by all who have paid any attention to recent research, but no attempt has hitherto been made to set these elements down categorically and to examine the conclusions which are to be drawn from them.

It is due to the large and increasing band of folklore devotees that the uses of folklore should be brought forward. The scoffer at these studies is apt to have it all his own way so long as the bulk of the books published on folklore contain nothing but collected examples of tales, customs, and superstitions, arranged for no purpose but that of putting the facts pleasantly before readers. But, more than this, recent research tends to show the increasing importance of bringing into proper order, within reasonable time, all the evidence that is available from different sources upon any given subject of inquiry. Looked at in this light, ethnology has great claims upon the student. The science of culture has almost refused to deal with it, and has been content with noting only a few landmarks which occur here ami there along the lines of development traceable in the elements of human culture. But the science of history has of late been busy with many problems of ethno- logical importance, and has for this purpose turned sometimes to craniology, sometimes to archeology, sometimes to philology, but rarely to folklore. If folk- lore, then, does contain ethnological facts, it is time that they should be disclosed, and that the method of dis- covering them should be placed before scholars.

Of course, my attempt in this direction must not be looked upon in any sense as an exhaustive treatment of the subject, and I am not vain enough to expect that all my conclusions will be accepted. I believe that the time has come when every item of folklore should be docketed and put into its proper place, and I hope I have done something towards this end in the following pages. When complete classification is attempted some of the items of folklore will be found useless enough. But most of them will help us to understand more of the development of thought than any other subject; and many of them will, if my reading of the evidence is correct, take us back, not only to stages in the history of human thought, but to the people who have yielded up the struggle of their minds to the modern student of man and his strivings.

At the risk of crowding the pages with footnotes, I have been careful to give references to all my authorities for items of folklore, because so much depends upon the value of the authority used in these studies. I believe they are all quoted accurately, but shall always be glad to know of any corrections or additions.

Professor Rhys has kindly read through my proofs, and I am very grateful for the considerable service he has thereby rendered me.

p1-2

Chapter 1

Survival and Development

THERE has grown up of late years a subject of inquiry- first antiquarian merely, and now scientific into the peasant and local elements in modern culture, and this subject has not inaptly been termed ' folklore.' Almost always at the commencement of a new study much is done by eager votaries which has to be undone as soon as settled work is undertaken, and it happens, I think, that because the elements of folklore are so humble and unpretentious, because they have to be sought for in the peasant's cottage or fields, in the children's nursery, or from the lips of old gaffers and gammers, that unusual difficulties have beset the student of folklore. Not only has he to undo any futile work that stands in the way "of his special inquiry, but he has to attempt the rebuilding of his edifice in face of contrasts frequently drawn between the elements which make up his subject and those supposed more dignified elements with which the historian, the archaeologist, and the philologist have to deal.

The essential characteristic of folklore is that it consists of beliefs, customs, and traditions which are far behind civilisation in their intrinsic value to man, though they exist under the cover of a civilised nationality. This estimate of the position of folklore with reference to civilisation suggests that its con- stituent elements are survivals of a condition of human thought more backward, and therefore more ancient, than that in which they are discovered.

Except to the students of anthropology, the fact of the existence of survivals of older culture in our midst is not readily grasped or understood. Historians have been so engrossed with the political and commercial progress of nations that it is not easy to determine what room they would make in the world for the non-progressive portion of the population. And yet the history of every country must begin with the races who have occupied it. ...

A Plan to "digitise" the transribe the parish registers of the nation

PARISH REGISTERS.— STATISTICS.

Among the good services rendered to the public by yourself and your correspondents, few, I think, will be found more important than that of having drawn their attention to Mr. Wyatt Edgell's valuable suggestions on the transcription of Parochial Registers. The supposed impracticability of his plan has perhaps hitherto deterred those most competent to the work from giving it the consideration which it deserves. I believe the scheme to be perfectly practicable; and as a first move in the work, I send you the result of my own dealings with the registers of my parish.

It is many years since I felt the desideratum which Mr. Edgell has brought before the public; and, by way of testing the practicability of transcribing and printing the parochial registers of the entire kingdom in a form convenient for reference, I made an alphabetical transcript of my own, which is now complete. The modus operandi which I adopted was this :—1. I first transcribed, on separate slips of paper, each baptismal entry, with its date, and a reference to the page of the register, tying up the slips in the order in which the names were entered in the register; noting, as I proceeded, on another paper, the number of males and females in each year.

2. The slips being thus arranged, they came in their places handy for collation with the original. I then collated each, year by year; during the process depositing the slips one by one in piles alphabetically, according to the initial letter of the surnames.

3. This done, I sorted each pile in an order as strictly alphabetical as that used in dictionaries or ordinary indices.

4. I then transcribed them into a book, in their order, collating each page as the work proceeded.

5. I then took the marriages in hand, adopting the same plan; entering each of these twice, viz. both under the husband's and the wife’s name.

6. Next, the burials, on the same plan.

7. I then drew up statistical tables of the num- ber of baptisms, marriages, and burials in each year, males and females separately ; where the register appeared badly kept making notes of the fact, and adding such observations as occasionally seemed necessary.
8. I then drew up lists of vicars, transcripts of miscellaneous records of events, and other casual entries that appeared in the register.\*

\* To obviate the difficulties arising from capricious spelling, I assumed that which I thought to be the correct one, and entered all of the name under that one, placing, however, in parenthesis, the actual mode of spelling adopted in the instance in question, and also entering the name, as actually spelt, in its proper place, with reference to the place where the searcher would find it; e.g. In my register, the name of " Caiser" ap- pears under more than twenty varieties of form. I enter them all under " Cayser." In the margin, opposite the first of these entries, I write consecutively the different modes of spelling the name —"Caisar," " Caiser," " Casiar," " Kayser," &c. &c. &c. In the table itself, I write,

Cayser, John.  
[Casiar] John,  
[Kaysar] John, &c. &c. &c.

Then, "Casiar," " Kaysar," &c., appear in their respective places sic, " Casiar," v. " Cayser," " Kaysar," v. " Cayser," &c., nearly on the plan adopted by Mr. Duffus Hardy in his admirable indices to the *Close Rolls*.

I noted, as I went on, the time occupied in each of these operations. It was as follows :—

1. The first transcripts on slips, with addition of statistical tables—
Baptisms - - - - 2004  
Marriages, 420; each twice 840  
Burials’ - - - 1244   
Total - - - 4088...55} hours,  
2 Collating and filing alphabetically 23 —  
3. Sorting in strict alphabetical order 134. —  
4. Transcribing into book - - 24 —  
5. Copying statistical tables into book 5 —  
Transcripts of miscellaneous entries, lists of vicars, &c. &c. 7 -  
Total - 195 1/4 hours.

My registers begin in the year 1558, and the present population of the parish is about 420; so that you have here an account of the labour necessary to complete an alphabetical transcript of the register of a rural parish of that extent in population,

I send you the result as a first step to a work of great national importance, and of inestimable value with relation to family descent, title to property long in abeyance, &c. &c. As to statistics, I doubt whether any data worthy of consideration can be obtained from these sources, owing to the constant irregularities which occur in keeping the registers.

No man, much less the minister of a psrish, who has abundant calls upon his time, can be expected to sit down to the task of transcribing his registers through many consecutive hours; but there are few who could not give occasionally one or two hours to the work. In this way I effected my transcripts ; the work of 195 hours being distributed through nearly five months—no great labour after all.

On an average, twelve words, with the figures, may be calculated for each entry ; which will give for this parish about 500 folios. Each entry having been transcribed twice, we may call it, ata rough calculation, 1000 folios written out ready for printing.
If the authorities at the Registrar-General's office would give their attention to it, they must have there abundant data on which to form calculations as to the probable cost of the undertaking. And I cannot help thinking that, setting aside printing as an after consideration, alphabetical transcripts, at least, might be obtained of all the parochial registers in the kingdom, and deposited in that office, at no insurmountable expense; and if the cost appear too heavy, the accomplishment of the work might be distributed through a given number of years ; say ten, or even twenty.

Parliament might, perhaps, be induced to vote an annual grant for so important a work till it was accomplished ; albeit, when we think of their niggardly denial of any thing to the printing, or even the conservation of the public records, san- guine hopes from that quarter can hardly be indulged.

To insure correctness, without which the scheme would be utterly valueless, I would propose that a certain number of competent transcribers be ap- pointed for each county, either at a given salary, or at a remuneration of so much per entry, to copy the registers of those parishes the ministers of which are unwilling to do it, or feel themselves unequal to the task. The option, however, should always, in the first instance, be given to the minister, as the natural custos of the registers, and as one, from local knowledge, likely to do the work correctly. To each county there should also be appointed one or more competent persons as collators, to correct the errors of the transcribers.

I throw out these rough hints in the hope that some of your correspondents will furnish their ideas on the subject, till we at last arrive at a fully practicable plan of carrying out Mr. Wyatt Edgell’s suggestions, and, at all events, obtain transcripts, if not printed copies, of every register in thekingdom.
