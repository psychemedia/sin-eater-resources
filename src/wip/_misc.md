BIZARRE TALES OF THE 'SIN EATER' AND CITY 'S LAST WIFE SALE: [Echonews Edition]
Northern Echo; Darlington (UK) [Darlington (UK)]. 09 Nov 2005: 09. 

THE long-forgotten past has been brought vividly back to life in a new book that explores a city's history.

Among the characters and facts that North Yorkshire historian Maurice Taylor has unearthed is the bizarre story of the Ripon Sin Eater.

A custom dating back to pre-Christian times, the sin eater was summoned to the bedside of a dead person. On the corpse was placed a tankard of ale containing a coin and a piece of bread.

The sin eater drank the ale, ate the bread and pocketed the coin, symbolically taking in the sins of the deceased.

The tradition continued in the area into the mid-19th Century.

Other stories in the book, An Illustrated History of Ripon, tell of the city's last-known wife sale and the last women to die accused of witchcraft, after a visit by a witch-finder.

Maurice Taylor has lived in Ripon for more than 30 years and has been researching its history since 1992. He often leads guided walks there.

He has uncovered much new information for the book, as well as previously unpublished illustrations.

The chapters cover the city's origins from prehistoric times to the present day, covering subjects including the market, its religious past and heroes and villains.

The book also contains lists of wakemen, mayors and bishops, as well as information such as the origins of Ripon street names.

An Illustrated History of Ripon, priced 12.99, will be launched on December 8 and will be available from House of Stratus, in Fishergate, Ripon.

Copies can be ordered in advance from the shop.
