I am now going to give you an account of the Kyhirraeth, a doleful fore-boding noise before death, and enquire into the cause of this, and of the appear- ance of the Corpse-Candles.
a doleful disagreeable sound heard before the deaths of many, and most apt to be heard before foul weather: the voice resembles the groaning of sick persons who are to die; heard at first at a distance, then comes nearer, and the last near at hand; so that it is a three-fold warning of death, — the king of terrors. It begins strong and louder than a sick man can make, the second cry is lower, but not less doleful, but rather more so; the third yet lower and soft, like the groaning of a sick man, almost spent and dying; so that a person well remembering the voice, and coming to the sick man's bed who is to die, shall hear his groans exactly alike,

BIZARRE TALES OF THE 'SIN EATER' AND CITY'S LAST WIFE SALE: [Echonews Edition]
Northern Echo; Darlington (UK) [Darlington (UK)]. 09 Nov 2005: 09. 

THE long-forgotten past has been brought vividly back to life in a new book that explores a city's history.

Among the characters and facts that North Yorkshire historian Maurice Taylor has unearthed is the bizarre story of the Ripon Sin Eater.

A custom dating back to pre-Christian times, the sin eater was summoned to the bedside of a dead person. On the corpse was placed a tankard of ale containing a coin and a piece of bread.

The sin eater drank the ale, ate the bread and pocketed the coin, symbolically taking in the sins of the deceased.

The tradition continued in the area into the mid-19th Century.

Other stories in the book, An Illustrated History of Ripon, tell of the city's last-known wife sale and the last women to die accused of witchcraft, after a visit by a witch-finder.

Maurice Taylor has lived in Ripon for more than 30 years and has been researching its history since 1992. He often leads guided walks there.

He has uncovered much new information for the book, as well as previously unpublished illustrations.

The chapters cover the city's origins from prehistoric times to the present day, covering subjects including the market, its religious past and heroes and villains.

The book also contains lists of wakemen, mayors and bishops, as well as information such as the origins of Ripon street names.

An Illustrated History of Ripon, priced 12.99, will be launched on December 8 and will be available from House of Stratus, in Fishergate, Ripon.

Copies can be ordered in advance from the shop.

Elias Owen was a cleric and an antiquary. His early career was in teaching and he became headmaster of Llanllechid National School. Owen had a keen interest in archaeological matters and he published many researches on the antiquities of his parish in the 'North Wales Chronicle'. Even though Owen followed a career in education and the Church he remained a diligent student of antiquities. His 'Welsh folk-lore' was a prized essay at the 1887 National Eisteddfod, London. It was published as a single volume in 1896.

emblems of his occupation, the rule, compass, and square, and he made the following epitaph :
This craggy stone or covering for an architect's bed,.
The lofty buildings raised high, yet now lyes down his head:
His line and rule, so death concludes, are locked up in store,
Build they who list, or they who wist, for he can build no more.
His house of clay could hold no longer ;
May Heavens frame him stronger.
John Abel
Vive ut vivas in vitum cetcrnam."

Abel died in 1674 at the age of ninety seven. He had not only a constructive capacity, but a fine imagination. His outlines are graceful, and his details extremely good. Architecture owes much to his ability, more especially the fine examples of his work in Herefordshire.

The curious custom of sin-eating lingered at Ledbury much later than in other places on the Welsh border. Mrs. F. H. Leather, writing in "Memorials of Old Herefordshire" (1904), deals with the subject in the "Folk-lore of the Shire." She records that on Palm Sunday the day is celebrated in a curious manner in Hentland Church. "The churchwardens," writes Mrs. Leather, "present to the clergyman and each of the congregation, a small cake, which is eaten within the church, as evidence of a desire to cease from all enmities and to prepare for the Easter festival." It would be interesting to know the connection, if any, between this custom and the ancient practice of sin-eating. Formerly a cup of beer accompanied each cake, but this part of the ceremony has now been abandoned. This custom was observed also at Sellack as late as 1867.

The practice of "sin-eating" referred to, peculiar to the Welsh border, was discontinued before the end of the seventeenth century. The following description of it, given in Brand's "Popular Antiquities," is taken from the Lansdowne Manuscripts: "In the County of Hereford it was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them—he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentably poor rascal—I remember that he lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that when a corpse was brought out and laid on the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, full of beer, which was also drunk up, and sixpence in money. In consideration whereof, he took upon him *ipso facto* all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after death. This custom alludes, methinks, to something of the scapegoat kind in Ihe Levitical law, and though rarely used in our days, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government. ... The like is done in the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowl for the sinne eater."
Another account says the sin-eater "pronounced the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."

Dr. Schuyler, in his book on Turkestan, describes a corresponding custom: "In Ach Kurgan ... he met an old man called an ishachi, who made his living by taking upon himself the sins of the dead, and devoting his life to prayer for their souls."

THE REVENANT ON THE THRESHOLD
Elif Boyacıoğlu
Abstract: This study explores accounts of the revenant, the walking dead in
medieval Britain through the concept of a failure in the ritual process that surrounded death. This concept is used to explore the rituals leading to, surrounding, and following death, as well as the consequences of their perceived failure.
The study of folklore and supernatural beliefs provides a unique insight into the
perception of the failed ritual process of death and its consequences, as well as
how the community dealt with them. Thus the nature of the revenant and the
conditions that lead to its existence as a consequence of a ritual failure will be
explored. It is identified as a stagnated presence, divorced from its ritual context,
with no foreseeable end. The revenant threatens the community as a whole, be
it through physical violence or contagion; it needs to be excised to protect the
community and its members.

sin eater story in S. Baring Gould's new novel, *Guavas the Tinner*.


FOLLOWING GUAVAS REVIEWS INCLUDED IN BOOK BUT NOT RESOURCES

OF recent essays in fiction indubitably the most striking is S. BARING GOULD'S Guavas the Tinner (Methuen). The story, rich in detail of quaint customs now obsolete, is set among the tin-mines of Dartmoor during Elizabeth's reign. Writ in Mr. BARIING GOULD'S bold, telling manner, it is full of vivid actuality, and presents that keenness of method — giving no word that has not direct bearing on the theme — which characterises the work of this able writer.

NEW NOVELS

...

"GUAVAS THE TINNER,"

Mr. Baring-Gould's latest story is a romance of Dartmoor in the days of Oueen Elizabeth, and it has all the freshness, the colour, and the picturesque originality which give distinction to his tales. It is a rather sombre story, for it opens with a scene on a dark moorland on a bitter night, which discloses a man( pinioned to a cross by a knife stuck through his hand, while a wolf, scenting blood, prowls round him and threatens to spring at his throat. It is also a strictly historical story, for Mr. Baring-Gould, whose information is unbounded, has gathered together elaborate details as to the mining customs of the age and country of which he writes, and has not spared his frivolous readers in retailing them. We miss the whimsical humour which he sometimes permits to carry him away. We miss the lighter touches which the novel-reader loves. But when every criticism is exhausted, the power and charm of his new book survive, and in its force and its impressiveness it remains a characteristic product of a writer who is never commonplace. The story of Guavas is a very simple one. He is a Cornish miner driven from his claim by the jealous rivalry of his Dartmoor colleagues, and torn between the stormy passion which nearly brings him to the feet of Isolt, the bailiff's dark and handsome daughter, and the gentler, deeper love which ultimately binds him to Lemonday Ford, a sweetheart of a less alarming and exacting type. We are a little inclined to think that Mr. Baring-Gould, in making Lemonday the winner, has sacrificed the interest of what might have been a finely tragic tale. But there is no doubt that Guavas would have led a less happy life with Isolt, and that he deserved tranquillity after all the adventures he went through. The book is throughout exceedingly original, full of vivid scenes, full of striking people, and full of that local colour which its author can always paint in with a master hand. Whatever criticisms we may suggest, we cannot fail to recognise its merits, and to admire the versatility and vigour in which its writer never fails.

ROMANCE AND HISTORY.

"Guavas the Tinner." The tin-workers of Dartmoor in the Elizabethan age have supplied Mr. Baring-Gould with the material for a romance in his later manner, and he has made of it a very neat and effective piece of work within its somewhat narrow bounds. The peculiar customs and laws observed (or not observed) by these craftsmen were of a kind to lend imaginative writer useful aid, should he desire to add individuality and local colour to his purely fictitious elements. Thus, both by the insertion of footnotes and by copious explanations in the text, Mr. Baring-Gould's new novel, Guavas the Tinner (Methuen and Co.) has something of historic dignity sustain its surface of romance. The subject is quite unhackneyed, and therefore welcome; while it is treated in a fresh and interesting fashion, with poetic fancy and dramatic skilL So much, however, we always expect from Mr. Baring-Gould. We have in time past had from him, in addition, subtle method of characterisation which is, unfortunately absent from his present book. Guavas, the hero, and his pair of loves, are pleasantly drawn, but quite elementary in conception; no personality of the story has any depth or any qualities likely to make a lasting impression. They are companionable for the moment, as are all Mr. Baring-Gould's heroes and heroines, but they will be quickly forgotten. On the other hand, there are spirit and a verisimilitude about the plan and execution of the story which make it, as whole, one to be remembered.

MR. BARING GOULDS LATEST

Mr. Baring-Gould has again made good use of his passionate love of exploring old traditions and unearthing from historic spots the secrets of their past; and in burrowing among the old tin-workings of Dartmoor, as he frequently burrows among the old folk-songs of the West, he has on this occasion found material for a somewhat wild and fantastic tale which he is pleased to place in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, though probably the tale would gain in probability by being put back least a century or so. Guavas the Tinner is a Cornish miner who, working among Dartmoor folk with better skill and luck than the natives, incurs the envy of all, and still more the hatred of Dickon Rawle, a mean fellow whose rival is for the affections of Isolt, the daughter of the Bailiff of the Stannaries. This lady is of the ravenhaired, wild, and wicked order; and being herself in love with Guavas and fearing that his affections have strayed to a little moorland maiden called Lemonday (the names are all quaint enough), connives at her hero being nailed by the hand to a post for a breach pf the stannary laws in order that she may release him under oath of perpetual constancy to her. But human hearts are not chained in this way, and a series of cleverly wrought incidents bind Guavas to the purer love of the moorland maid. It will be guessed that excitement and incident are not wanting before the successful ending of the tale is reached when say that, besides the transfixion of Guavas on Dartmoor, there is fearfully realistic right between a man and a wolf, the burying alive of the hero in a disused mine, the shooting of the wicked Isolt with a silver bullet by the bungling Dickon Rawle, and the disappearance of this inefficient villain in a bog. The narrative is interspersed with those charming little touches of folk-lore which come so trippingly to the pen of the writer; among others may be mentioned a very curious wake and pretty monkish legend about Joseph of Arimathea's connection with the West of England tin trade. The invocation to Joseph used at the smelting of the tin, and quoted as prevalent in Devonshire in Elizabethan times, is, oddly enough, used to this day at a factory in London where tin is the metal employed. This piece of knowledge, accidentally acquired, we venture to present to Mr. Baring-Gould in return for a few hours' pleasant reading.  *Guavas the Tinner. By S. Baring-Gould.
