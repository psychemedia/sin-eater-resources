THE "SIN EATER" AT CELTIC FUNERALS. In his fifth Celtic lecture at Glasgow University on Saturday, the Rev. Dr Henderson continued the discussion of the death and funeral rites of the Celts. He mentioned the curious custom of the "sin-eater," traces of which, though not the rite itself, lingered in the Highlands. At a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association at Ludlow in 1852, Llandebie, near Swansea, was specified as a place where the custom had survived to within a recent period. When a person died the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread which he finally ate, thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received a fee of half a crown, and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze; for as it was believed that he had really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood, regarded as a mere Pariahâ€”as one irredeemably lost. The custom as practised among the Lowland Scots was known as dishaloof. Dr Henderson cited instances of the custom as once practised in Yorkshire, in Bavaria, and in Turkestan. One might think, he said, that such a rite as that of sin-eating would soon pass away. But a case had been observed in England as recently as 1893.
