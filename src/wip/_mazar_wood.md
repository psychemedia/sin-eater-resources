MAZER WOOD : GUTTA PERCHA. 

In the Musaeum Trade.icantimium, or a Collectian 
of liarities preserved at South Lambeth, near Lon- 
don, by John Tradescant, 1656, I find, amongst 
"other variety of rarities," "the plyable IMazer 
wood, which, being warmed in water, will work to 
any form;" and a little farther on, in the list of 
"utensils and household stufFe," I also find "Mazer 
dishes." In my opinion, it is more than a coin- 
cidence that Doctor Montgomery, who, in 1843, 
received the gold medal of the Society of Arts 
for bringing giitta percha and its useful properties 
under tiie notice of that bodv, describes it in 
almost the same words that Tradescant uses when 
speaking of the jiliable jNlazer wood: the Doctor 
say.s, "it coidd be moulded into any form by 
merely dipping it into boiling water." It is 
worthy of remark that Tradescant, who was the 
first botanist of his day, seems to have been un- 
certain of the true nature of the " Mazer wood," 
&)T he does not class it with his " gums, rootes, 
woods ;" but, as before observed, in a hetero- 
geneous collection which he styles " other variety 
ef rarities." Tresuming, as I do, that this Mazer 
wood was what we now term gutta ]K'rcha, the 
(lueslion may be j)ropounded, how could Trades- 
cant have procured it from its remote locale? 
'J'he answer is easy. In another part of the 
Musaum Tradescaiitianum may be found a list of 
the "benefactors" to the collection; and amongst 



their names occurs that of William Curteen, Esq. 
Now this "\\'iniam Curteen and his father Sir 
William, of Flemish descent, were the most ex- 
tensive British merchants of the time, and had 
not only ships trading to, but also possessed forts 
and factories on, some of the islands of the 
Eastern Archipelago, the native habitat of tlie 
sapotaceous tree that yields the gutta percha. 
Curteen was a collector of curiosities himself, and 
no doubt his captains and agents were instructed 
to procure such : in short, a specimen of gutta 
percha was just as likely to attract the attention 
of an intelligent Englishman at Amboyna in the 
fifteenth century, as it did at Singapore in the 
nireteenth. 

If there are still any remains of Tradescant's 
collection in the Ashraolcan Museum at Oxford, 
the question, whether the Mazer wood was gutta 
percha or not, might be soon set at rest ; but it is 
highly probable that the men who ordered the 
relics of the Dodo to be thrown out, showed but 
little ceremony to the Mazer wood or dishes. 

A curious instance of a word, not very dissimilar 
to Mazer, may be found in Eric Red's Saga, part 
of the Flat'o Annals, supposed to be written in the 
tenth century, and one of the authorities for the 
pre-Columbian discovery of America by the Ice- 
landers. Karlsefne, one of the heroes of the Saga, 
while his ship was detained by a contrary wind in 
a JTorwegian port, was accosted by a German, who 
wished to purchase his, Karlsefne's, broom. 

" ' I will not sell it,' said Karlsefne. ' I will give 
you half a mark in gold for it,' said the German man. 
Karlsefne thought this a good offer, and thereupon 
concluded the bargain. Tile German man went away 
with the broom. Karlsefne did not know what wood 
it was ; but it was Masur, which had come from Wine- 
land!" 

Perhaps some reader may give an instance of 
Mazer wood being mentioned by other writers ; or 
inform me if the word Mazer, in itself, had any 
peculiar signification. W. Pinkerton.

Mazer Wood (Vol. iii., p. 239.). — The Querist 
asks, " Has the word Mazer any signification in 
itsslf?" 

It is used to signify a cup. Vide Walter Scott's 
Lord of the Isles, where Robert Bruce is speaking: 

" Bring here, he said, the Mazers four, 
My noble fathers loved of yore.' 

And it is probably derived from the Irish " Maed- 
dher," a standing cup, generally of wood, of a 
quadrangular form, witli a handle on e.ach of the 
sides. The puzzle was how to drink out of it, 
which was done from tlie angles. A silver " Maed- 
dher" was presented to Lord Townshend when 
leaving Ireland, who puzzled many of his English 
friends by placing it before them filled with claret. 
Uninitiated persons usually attempted to drink 
from the flat side, and poured the wine over their 
clothes. I tliink another was presented to Lord 
Normanby when in Ireland. We see guttapercha

Mazer Wood (Vol. iii., pp. 2.39. 288 ). — 
Your Querist asks, " Has the word Mazer any 
signification in itself?" It signifies iJ/ayj/e, being 
a corruption of the "Welsh word Masarn — the 
maple-tree. Probably, therefore, the use of the 
wood of the maple tor bowls and drinking-cups 
prevailed in this country many centuries before 
the times of Spenser and Chaucer, in whose works 
they are mentioned. In Devonshire the black 
cherry-tree, which grows to a large size in that 
county, is called the mazer-tree. From this cir- 
cumstance I conjecture that this wood has been 
used there in former times for bowls and drinking- 
cups as a substitute for maple. That the original 
word, mazer, should have been retained, is not to 
be wondered at. It is known that when the mazer 
bowl was made of silver, the old name was re- 
tained. The name of the maple-tree, in the Irish 
language, is crann-mhalpais ; therefore the name 
of the Irish wooden driuking-cup mtedher cannot 
be derived from it. S. S. S.

Mazer Wood and Sin-eaters (Vol. iii., pp. 239. 
288.).—The following extract from Hone’s Year 
Book, p.858., will add to the explanation fur- 
nished by S.S.S., and will also give an instance 
of the singular practices which prevailed among 

“ Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British 
Museum are statements in Aubrey’s own handwriting 
to this purport. In the county of Hereford was an 


old custom at funerals, to hire poor people, who were 

to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One 
of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable, poor 
rascal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse high- 
way. The manner was, that when the corpse was 
brought out of the house, and laid on the bier, a loaf 
of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin 
eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple, 
full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence 
in money, in consideration whereof he took upon him, 
ipso facto, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or 
her from walking after they were dead.” 

Perhaps some of your readers may be able to 
throw some light on this curious practice of sin- 
eating, or on the existence of regular sin-eaters.

[ Mr. Ellis, in his edition of Brande’s Popular Anti- 
quities, vol. ii. p. 155, 4to. has given a curious passage 
from the Lansdowne MSS. concerning a sin-eater who 
lived in Herefordshire, which has been quoted in the 
Gentleman's Magazine, vol, xcii. pt. i. p. 222. ]
