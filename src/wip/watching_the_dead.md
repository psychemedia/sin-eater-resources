> DOLES AND INVITATIONS AT FUNERALS.

> Doles were used at funerals, as we learn from St. Chrysostom, to procure rest to the soul of the deceased, that he might find his judge propitious. [Greek quotation in footnote.]

> The giving of a dole, and the inviting of the poor ["Preteria convocabantur et invitabantur necdum sacerdotes et religiosi, sed et egeni pauperes." Durand. Had our famous poet, Mr. Pope, an eye to this in ordering, by will, poor men to support his pall? By the will of William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, executed April 29, 1397, he directs "that twenty-five shillings should be daily distributed among three hundred poor people from the time of his death to the arrival of his body at the conventual church of Bustlesham, in which it was to he deposited." See Warner's Topographical Remarks, relating to the Southwestern parts of Hampshire, ii. 73.] on this occasion, are synonymous terms. There are some strong figurative expressions on this subject in St. Ambrose's Funeral Oration on Satyrus, cited by Durand. Speaking of those who mourned on the occasion, he says: "The poor also shed their tears; precious and fruitful tears, that washed away the sins of the deceased. They let fall floods of redeeming tears." From such passages as the above in the first Christian writers, literally understood, the Romanists may have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead.

> Strutt, in his English AEra, tells us that Sir Robert Knolles, in the eighth year of Henry IV., died at his manor in Norfolk, and his dead body was brought in a litter to London with great pomp and much torchlight, and it was buried in the White Friars' church, "where was done for him a solemn obsequie, with a great feast and *lyberal dole* to the poore." This custom, says Strutt, of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners, was universally practised all over the kingdom, as well as giving alms to the poor, in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased. Manners and Customs, ii. 209. See a curious account of doles in Dr. Ducarel's Tour through Normandy, fol. ed. p. 81.

> Among the articles of expense at the funeral of Sir John Rudstone, Mayor of London, 1531, given by Strutt, iii. 169, from MS. Harl. 1231, we find the following charges: "Item, to the priests at his ennelling, [Anointing with holy oil. See Halliwell's Dict., p. 61.] 9s.; to poor folke in almys, 5s.; 22 days to 6 poor folke, 2s.; 26 days to a poor folke, 8d." Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, i. 579, speaking of Eskdale chapeiry, says: "Wakes and doles are customary; and weddings, christenings, and funerals are always attended by the neighbours, sometimes to the amount of a hundred people. The popular diversions are hunting and cock-fighting." Nichols, in his History of Leicestershire, ii. part i. p. 357, speaking of Stathern in Framland hundred, says: "In 1790 there were 432 inhabitants, the number taken by the last person who carried about bread, which was given for *dole* at a funeral; a custom formerly common throughout this part of England, though now fallen much into disuse. The practice was sometimes to bequeath it by will; but, whether so specified or not, the ceremony was sel-dom omitted. On such occasions a small loaf was sent to every person, without any distinction of age or circumstances, and not to receive it was a mark of particular disrespect. [Mr, Lysons, in his Environs of London, iii. 341, speaking of some lands said to have been given by two maiden gentlewomen to the parish of Paddington, for the purpose of distributing bread, cheese, and beer among the inhabitants on the Sunday before Christmasday, tells us that they are now let at £21 per annum, and that "the bread was formerly thrown from the church-steeple to be scrambled for, and part of it is still distributed in that way."]

> Pennant, in his History of Whiteford Parish, p. 99, says: "Offerings at funerals are kept up here, and, I believe, in all the Welsh churches." He also says: "In North Wales, pence and half-pence (in lieu of little rolls of bread), which were heretofore, and by some still are, given on these occasions, are now distributed to the poor, who flock in great numbers to the house of the dead before the corpse is brought out. When the corpse is brought out of the house, laid upon the bier, and covered, before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased, widow, mother, daughter or cousin, (never done by a man,) gives, over the corpse, to one of the poorest neighbours, three 2d. or four 3d. white loaves of bread, or a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor person who receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister, if present, says the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward for church. The things mentioned above as given to a poor body are brought upon a large dish over the corpse, and the poor body returns thanks for them, and blesses God for the happiness of his friend and neighbour deceased." This custom is evidently a remain of the *Sin-Eating*, q. v.

> It appears from the Statistical Account of Scotland, v. 523, that at Glasgow large donations at funerals are made to the poor, "which are never less than five pounds, and never exceed ten guineas, in which case the bells of the city are tolled."

> In Dives and Pauper, First Precept, chap. 63, we read :
> "*Dives.* What seyst thou of them that wole no solemnyte have in their buryinge, but be putt in erthe anon, and that that shulde be spent aboute the buriyng they bydde that it shulde be yoven to the pore folke blynde and lame? — *Pauper*. Comonly in such prive buriynges ben *ful smalle doles and lytel almes yoven, and in solemne buriynges been grete doles and moche almesse [Alms. See examples in nalliwell's Dict., p. 47. ] yoven, for moche pore people come thanne to seke almesse*. But whanne it is done prively, fewe wytte therof, and fewe come to axe almesse! for they wote nat whanne ne where, ne whom they shulde axe it. And therefore I leve sikerly that summe fals executoures that wolde kepe alle to themself biganne firste this errour and this folye, that wolden make themself riche with ded mennys godes, and nat dele to the pore after dedes wylle, as noweall false executoures use by custome." ["The auncient fathers, being veri desirous to move their audience unto charitye and almose dedes, did exhorte them to refresh the poore and to give almoses in the funeralles, and yeares myndes of their frendes and kynnesfolkes, in stedde of the bankettes that the paynymes and heathen were wont to make at suche doinges, and in stedde of the meates that they did bring to their sepulchres and graves." The Huntyng of Purgatory, by Veron, 1561, f. 106]
