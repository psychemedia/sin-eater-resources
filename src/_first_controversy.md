# The First Controversy, 1875

The response to the article in *Blackwood's*magazine*, and in particular the mention of "the sin-eater", begins with the Vol 8 Iss 182 edition *The Academy*, dated [November 6th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-06_8_182/page/478/mode/2up?q=legends), on p. 478

> AMONG curious customs and superstitions noticed in an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folk-lore of North Wales" there is one the singularity of which is heightened by the statement that it still survives in North and South Wales and the Border. At a funeral, "a hireling who lives by such services has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from walking after death." The scapegoat is currently called a "Sin-eater."

In the following issue ([Vol 8 Iss 183, Novemmber 13th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-13_8_183/page/504/mode/2up?q=legends)), the first piece of correspondence appears, from a certain *D. SILVAN EVANS*, on p.506. Silvan Evans had presumably picked up notice of the item in the previous edition of the *Academy*:

> In the ACADEMY of November 6 (p. 478) I find an extract from an article in Blackwood on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death;" and this functionary, it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends.

> D. SILVAN EVANS.

At the time of writing, Daniel Silvan Evans was an ordained priest and scholar, author and editor of several Welsh language works including an English and Welsh dictionary. He was also just at the end of his term of editing *Archaeologia Cambrensis* (1871-1875), the journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, which may be recalled as the venue for Matthew Moggridge's observations on the sin eater in 1852.

The letter expresses a certain amount of doubt as to the veracity of the "alleged" tradition, based on the author having lived for a quarter of a century in the principality in an occupation that *"often brings me in contact with funerals"* and having *"never found a trace of such a custom"*.

Silvan Evans then goes on to request further information on sources and locations and offers to visit the location to pursue further investigations. He also asks for the " *Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater"'* as one *"interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends"*. 

A reprinted version of Silvan Evans letter to the *Academy* also appeared *The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard*, published on [November 19th, 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3307679/3307686/41/sin-eater), p7, introduced as:

> LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES.- The following letter has appeared in the Academy. "Llanymawddwy Rectory. Merioneth November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy*of November 6th, (p 478) I find ...

The next issue of the *Academy*, Vol 8 Iss 18 dated [November 20th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-20_8_184), pp. 529-30, has a response that recaptures must of the evidence that we are familiar with. It is restated here to provide a concise benchmark for the state of understanding we might have expected from the participants from this point in the debate.

> "LEGENDS AND FOLK-LORE OF NORTH WALES": THE SIN-EATER, Hammersmith : Nov. 16, 1875.
>
> Professor Evans has "never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period." May I be allowed to point out what appears to be the original passage from which the writer of the article drew the authority for his statement, and apparently its very words ? It occurs in a work so well-known as *Brand's Popular Antiquities* (Bohn's edition, 1849, vol. ii. 246-248), where the following is cited from Bagford’s letter, dated February 1, 1714-5, in Leland's *Collectanea*, i. 76 :—
>
> "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq."
>
> The following words of Aubrey’s own are then quoted :—
>
> "In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor peopie, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. Ono of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal) I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowlo, of muple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. . . . This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman deceased there had this cere- monie punctually performed, according to her will: and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." (*Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism.* Lansdowne MSS. 226, fol. 116.)
>
> In a note the same writer adds that at Llanggors, Brecon, about 1640, Mr. Gwin, the minister, "could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome." And he says in another page of the MS. cited: "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales."
>
> While these statements very clearly affirm the former prevalence, in North Wales and the Border, of the superstitious practice in question, they do not, of course, go to show that, in the words of the article, it is "still surviving" in those localities, as well as in South Wales. The writer, however, of the interesting compilation in *Blackwood* has little to tell us about surviving North Welsh superstitions, and less that is new. Some of those mentioned (e.g., that about pigeon's feathers, and the Bible and key or sieve spell to find'a thief) are common in various parts of England and Scotland; others, like the *Canwyll Corph* (Corpse Candle), are more or less satisfactorily referred to in well-known works— as in the *Choice Notes from Notes and Queries*, and in the old *Cambrian Quarterly Magazine*; other remarkable superstitions, again, alleged to be still living, such as that of the *Mallt y Nos*, or *Mam y Drwg* (Mother of Mischief), are not mentioned.
>
> I venture to remark that the popular superstitions of Wales still await a student, acquainted with the Welsh language, and content, instead of seeking *folk*-lore from books, to collect it at the firesides of the people, in the out-of-the-way villages and secluded glens where it lingers longest. David Fitzgerald.

There is a second piece of correspondence, immediately following (p530), that add's a further reference to Hone's *Year Book*:

> Croeswylan, Oswestry.
> In reference to the strange profession of "Sin-Eater," mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in *Blackwood* resides. Askew Roberts.


?first hint that correspondent Askew Roberts, at least, has an inkling who the author of the *Blackwood* article is.

> The Academy of Nov. 20, contains the following letter on the subject, in reply to the Rev. Silvan Evans :—
>
> In reference to the strange profession of a Sin-Eater, mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in Blackwood resides. Croeswylan, Oswestry. ASKEW ROBERTS.
>
> The following is the information given by Hone in his *Year Book*, col. 858:— According to Lawrence Howell, *History of the Pontificate*, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, "They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, however, Sin Eating has been a very much more vulgar affair, and a letter from John Bagford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's *Collectanea*, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:—
>
> Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old "sire," (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."
>
> Bagford states that he received his information from "the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounts of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own handwriting. In these he tells of "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a professional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon "at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

> Mr. Silvan Evans's ignorance of the superstition of the "Sin-eater" as connected with Wales and the Border counties surprises me the more as he has been for some years editor of the *Cambrian Archaeological Journal*; and during those years, if I mistake not, the second series of that valuable work has been carefully indexed. If he will turn to Ser. II., vol. iii. pp- 330, *seq.*, he will find that at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852 Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire. That which can be pointed to within a generation back may be said, speaking broadly, to "survive" or linger still; and I have only delayed writing these remarks in the hopes of hunting up a paper where, early in the present year, I found a notice of a still later case. Other of your correspondents have relieved me of the necessity of referring to instances of the "Sin-eater" custom cited by Leland, Aubrey, and others, as having occurred between 1686 and 1715 in three or four Herefordshire parishes, in Shropshire, *in the villages adjoining Wales*, at Llangorse, near Brecon, and elsewhere in North and South Wales.
>
> I regret that my ignorance of Welsh precludes me from giving Mr. Evans the Welsh equivalent for the term. My article in *Blackwood* pretends to no such knowledge, though I regret, as a Borderer, that my education herein is imperfect.
>
> Should I be able to trace the custom to a still later date than 1848 or 1852, no one will be better Pleased than myself to communicate the fact to the Academy.

> In reply to Rev. D Sdvan Evans, the accuser says the case was under consideration brian Archaeologists in Ludlow, in 1852, when one Mr. Moggridge to the over-zealous cause where, within five years, at ecod near Llandebie, Carmarthenshire I Accused, the custom in Wales was said to be present, but when the test is called for it will go back to a maximum of 30 years. 30 years in this period is more than two hundred years ago. But although he returned to 1847, he could not tell us whether or not the circumstance took place in or near Llandebia whether at Llandilo fawr, Cwmdwr, Pontardulais, or elsewhere. But though he did specify a time and place, we assure him pf, Mr. Moggridge, and everyone else, did not take the Yes circumstance there within me of the older inhabitants. It is customary in some Welsh times before commencing with the body from the house to go for beer and cakes for the essentials, before gathering to assist in digestion; and it is highly probable that the scholar Moggridge assumed that this was the custom of his own nation's fool. It is very interesting to see a few superficial and fast antiquaries discussing subject houses. Great care must be taken with things that hold a close connection to a nation. Many factions belong to us as Welshmen, and turn our backs willingly to the scourge, but let us not be insulted for things or belonging to us, and that by a nation whose sacred place is sacred to superstition.

[Discussion on a paper "On the Belief in Bhutas—Devil and Guost Worship in Western India., pp408- By M. J. Watnovsz, F.R.A.S."]

> Mr. Moggridge said : Mention was made of superstitious observances in our own island. I may, therefore, be permitted to bring to your notice a curious custom that not long since was still extant in South Wales and some of the adjoining counties, that of the Sin-eater. More than two centuries ago a well-known writer, Aubrey de Gentilésisme gives a full account of this observance in Herefordshire, where he was fortunate enough to "interview" the Sin-eater himself. Among the mountains of South Wales I find a similar ceremony prevailing down to almost our own times. When a person died, the Sin-eater of the district was called in. On his arrival he received a plate, on which he poured some salt. Upon the salt he placed a piece of bread, laid the plate on the chest of the defunct, muttered words of charmed power while bending over the corse, then eat the bread, whereby he eat up and appropriated to himself all*the sins of the deceased, received two shillings and sixpence for his services, and quickly retired from the pitying gaze of are present, who regarded him as one utterly and irremediably lost.
>
> Mr. Jeremiah said: I was very much interested in the paper just read. With reference to the alleged custom of *sin-eating* in Wales, mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, I would remark that the discussion raised by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans in the (November 5, 1875) appears to have gone adrift for want of the Welsh word for *Sin-eater*. The discussion arose, as all must be aware, from a statement made by a writer in *Blackwood's Magazine* for last month, in an article on the Legend and Folk-lore of North Wales,' where he says, in reference to a funeral custom, that the "Scapegoat . . . is currently called a 'sin-eater.'" Dr. Evans demanded the Welsh equivalent, which the author of that article could not give, in consequence of, he says, "my ignorance of Welsh." (Academy, Nov. 27, p. 555.) Had he referred to Bingley’s "North Wales," vol. ii. p. 278, he would have seen a way out of his difficulty, and a clear answer to the query put by Dr. Evans; and Mr. Moggridge will also see, I think, that the custom was not known as sin-eating, although the original meaning may have been of that nature. Bingley says, "It is usual in several parts of North Wales for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person of the same sex, and nearly the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment, and in some instances for weeding and adorning it on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called Diodlys, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where, at the same time, the body is standing ona bier. It had its name from a custom, which is now discontinued (1804), of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceed with the body to the church." It appears, then, that the custom means simply a "gift of ale or beer," and not *sin-eating*. Pennant’s (in his "Tours in Wales," vol. iii. p. 159, edition 1810) account is slightly different. He says: "Previous to a funeral it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next-of-kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter—for it must be a female—to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves in a t dish, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it *immediately*. When that was done they kneeled down, and the minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceeded with the corpse, and at every crossway between the house and the church they laid down the bier and knelt, and again repeated the Lord's Prayer, and did the same when they first entered the churchyard." This custom,
and that of the alleged sin-eating, are conclusively one and the same, viz. that of Diodlys.
> 
> Mr Edkins and the President also made a few remarks.

> THE "SIN EATER" IN WALES.
>
> *To the Editor of the Aberystwyth Observer.*
>
> SIR.—The old saying is very true "if you want to hear news you must go from homo." Now we have received a strange piece of news, that we have a "Sin Eater" in connection with funerals in Wales. Some years ago, I was employed by an eminent antiquary to collect old Welsh legends, traditions and customs. I have made researches in almost every parish in South Wales but I never heard of the "Sin Eater."
>
> We are told this custom prevailed at Llandebe, in Carmarthenshire.
>
> I went to reside in that village in 1850; and I lived there for six years. My avocation brought me in contact with all the parishioners I knew them well, and I am well acquainted with the history of the place, its customs and traditions. I attended many funerals, but this Sin Eater never cropped up; and I never saw cakes distributed at funerals.
>
> The Welsh people are, it is true, in some localities a little tainted with superstition, as to ghosts &c., but they are not so superstitious as the importations who cross the "Severn Sea" to South Wales they are too well acquainted with their Bibles as to believe in such a thing as a "Sin Eater."
>
> We are told that this was maintained at the Cambrian Society's meeting held at Ludlow in 1852; if such trash as this be accepted by antiquarians as facts, their knowledge of the Principality must be very limited; and I pity their ignorance of Welsh history and traditions.
>
> I thank the Rev. Daniel S. Evans, of Llany-Mawddwy, for calling attention to this rank libel on Welshmen.
>
> I am, sir, yours faithfully,

> RHEIDIOL.

> BYE-GONES December 22, 1875.

THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)- The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter signed RHEIDIOL, Twmbariwn, on this subject, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer proceeds to say :- I lived at Llandebie many years ago, and I am well acquainted with the history of that parish and its customs and traditions, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a thing. I am well acquainted with Welsh lore in almost every parish in South Wales, which I collected for the late Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little superstitious, but he is far too intelligent to believe in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Association, that they have better foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

> Correspondence The Sin-Eater, by Prof. D. Silvan Evans
>
> THE SIN-EATER.
>
> Aberystwyth : Jan. 29, 1876.
>
> At the risk of exposing my “ignorance” still further, and thereby causing additional surprise to the writer of the paper on the “Legends and Folklore of North Wales” in *Blackwood’s Magazine*, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. Like every other country, the Principality had, and still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-eater does not appear to be among them. Since the appearance of my former letter in the ACADEMY (November 13), I have made all the enquiries I could into the subject, with the view of ascertaining whether such a personage has, or ever had, “a local habitation and a name” among us. I have spoken to many and corresponded with several persons who are known to have paid attention to the customs and traditions of the country; and the sum of their communications is, without any exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater was as novel to them as it was to me.
>
> The writer points to Llandebie as the place where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. Matthew Moggridge at the annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852, and is “surprised” that I, who became connected with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* in 1872, should not be minutely acquainted with everything that appeared in that journal some twenty years previously, Whether I ever read the account of the Ludlow meeting I cannot now say; but if I did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge’s revelations had been effaced from my memory when I wrote my letter. The writer tells us that “at the meeting of the Cambrian archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire.” Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for sentiments which he never expressed. The description of the sin-eater, given by Mr. Moggridge, is taken from Aubrey; and the following are his words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the organ of the Association :—
>
> "In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt."
>
> Out of this statement the author of the article makes “five years”! and by that process brings the custom down to 1847. Mr. Moggridge, in a letter dated the first day of the present year, tells me that he does “not remember anything that gives a date,” and adds that “the only written account” of the sin-eater "from *personal* knowledge is that of Aubrey, 'de Gentilisme.'" Aubrey, if I may rely on the extracts given in the ACADEMY, does not say that he was eyewitness to the performances of the sin-eater in any part of *Wales*, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as having prevailed at any time in the Principality; and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of the Principality and not of the English counties.
>
> But let us return to Llandebie, the locality in which it is asserted that the custom prevailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Rowlands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author of a small volume of *Historical Notes* published about ten years ago, and at one time librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these words :—
>
> “I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, customs, and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of the 'sin-eater;' in fact people there never give cakes at funerals. I know almost every parish in South Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth."
>
> Letters to the same effect appeared in the *Western Mail*, which circulates very extensively in the Principality, in the *Aberystwyth Observer*, and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin-eater.
>
> The Rev. Rees Evans, Vicar of Llandebie, has favoured me with the following letter in answer to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on the part of your readers for inserting it without abridgment :—
>
> "I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., which contained such extraordinary statements in reference to a superstitious custom supposed and alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the employment at funerals of a strange person called the 'sin-eater.' I have been the vicar of this parish for the last fourteen years, and I have known this neighbourhood well for the last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I received your letter of such a personage as the 'sin-eater.' However, with the view of arriving at the truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which appeared subsequently in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this parish, as to the probability of there having ever existed here such a functionary as 'sin-eater;' and the result of my investigation in the matter is this :—
>
> That such a custom as that alluded to in your letter never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had long conversations while investigating the matter in question for you. One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I have made, my candid opinion is that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any credible evidence."
>
> Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter of a century.
>
> The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge as being still seen in some parts have no connexion, or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin-eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are given for their employment. They are not uncommon, I understand, among Roman Catholics at the present day.
>
> The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just seen, he does not state that he saw any performance of the custom among the Welsh people. Those who only retail his statements need not detain us. I leave it to others to judge what amount of credibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part. If we put implicit belief in what he says about the sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, I do not see how we can consistently refuse his evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent.
>
> In conclusion I would remark that if the custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is somewhat strange, if not "surprising," that the discovery of it has been exclusively confined to those who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the country.

> There is a strange superstition concerning the "sin-eater." which remains in some secluded places, perhaps the echo of the idea of substitution for sin in the Jewish scapegoat. He presents himself, professionally, at the moment of death, puts a plate containing bread and salt on the breast of the corpse, mutters an incantation, and proceeds to eat the bread, thereby "eating up the sins of the dead," and especially preventing him, or her, from “walking” after death. The man who exercises this tremendous power is a sort of pariah, detested in the neighbourhood, and does his work for half-a-crown, and sometimes even goes as low as sixpence in his demands.
>
> Another instance of the extraordinary power which, it is supposed, can be exerted by very ordinary individuals, is accomplished by throwing oneself on one's knees and repeating the Cursing Psalms, when the dreadful wishes of David for his enemies are made to cling to the person thus prayed against. “The devil can quote Scripture” indeed. This Pagan and devilish use of the Bible, and the change of name, not of nature, which has taken place in many an ancient local deity, may still be met with in Brittany, where there was a Celtic goddess of Hate, now transmogrified into "Notre Dame de la Haine." If three *Aves* are uttered at nightfall in her chapel near Treguier, winged with the proper directions against the hated person, "death happens irrevocably within the year to him or her."

> THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES.
>
> February 8, 1876.
>
> I crave Mr. Silvan Evans's pardon for the hasty assumption that the editor of an Archaeological journal would possess or have access to a complete set of the past volumes, in which case he need not have denied in his first letter to the ACADEMY having ever heard of the Sin-eater in Wales, seeing that he now admits that if "he ever read Mr. Moggridge's revelations at Ludlow, they had been effaced from his memory" when he first wrote. To me he does not seem even now to have fully refreshed his memory; as after quoting a portion of Mr. Moggridge’s remarks at the Ludlow meeting in 1862, and calling Mr. Moggridge as a witness, at this distance of time, that "he does not remember anything that gives a date," he takes me to task *for making "five years!" out of that statement, and by that process bringing the custom down to* 1847. Had Mr. Evans turned over a leaf and read the last words of Mr. Moggridge on the occasion referred to, he would have found that they were to the effect that "he believed people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice: one case, he was informed, *occurred four or five years ago; but he believed it was extinct now.*" Perhaps, had I not wished to be succinct, I should have given Mr. Moggridge’s own words for the mountain valley in which, when he brought forward the subject in 1852, the practice was said to have existed till recently. But "at or near Llandebie" is a wide statement, and though the present vicar and the quondam schoolmaster may never have heard of the "Sin-eater," I am still disposed to believe that there must have been some foundation for Mr. Moggridge’s statement. Only last night, in the Introduction to Murray’s *Handbook to South Wales*, 1870 (the editor of which I am unacquainted with, although I have an impression that he was a medical man of eminence, connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works), I came upon this paragraph in p. xxvii: "The superstition of the sin-eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman in Caermarthenshire." I refer to the Ordnance Maps, and find Cwm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary*, refers to the same superstition, and if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr. Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practise on their credulity and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not widely removed from others which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius on 1 Cor. iv. 13 traces one such in Caesar’s account of the Gauls, B. ix, 6. That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious. Mr. Silvan Evans's parting shot at the discoverers "who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and but slightly acquainted with the country," shall not draw me from my incognito, or I might show him that by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, I am connected with two counties of South Wales, and that I have travelled frequently over most of the Principality, although I have failed to acquire its language.

> THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> The discussion on this subject, commenced in the Academy, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in Bye-gones towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the writer of an article in Blackwood, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthenshire, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave Dec 1. 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are now informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the existence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1876, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's communication.

> Llanymawddwy : Feb. 12, 1876.
>
> The question between the writer in Blackwood and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find that in his letter in the Academy of to-day he mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, leaving the point at issue just where it was. He stated in his article that the custom of the Sin-Eater prevails in North and South Wales at the present day; when I challenged that statement and asked for proof, we were told that by the present day he means some thirty years ago; and when pressed for the locality he goes under the aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebi "in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." When persons appeal to certain tribunals, they should not complain if they are sent to appear before the tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made on the spot by competent persons; and those who will take the trouble to read my last letter will see with what success, The Sin-Eater is as little known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. Now the writer shifts his ground and moves, under the enlightening guidance of Murray's *Handbook for Travellers in South Wales*, to Cwm Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The compiler of that volume, whether ever "connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works" or not, states nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal knowledge, or from the personal knowledge of any informants, but quotes almost the identical words of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight variation as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the February number of the Contemporary Review, simply relates the same story over again, without any corroboration of her own. A false story does not become truth by repetition, and these repetitions add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is simply waste of space to retail them.
>
> The writer complains that I did not turn over a certain leaf in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, where he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeologists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating was carried on *at Llandebie until within five years of that time* (1852). The leaf had been turned over and read before I wrote my last letter; I turn it over again, and on it read the last utterances of Mr. Moggridge as follows :—
>
> “Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of Sin-Eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped; and the rest still retained; and us he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thorough] ashamed of the practice; one case, he was infienel, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now.”
>
> These are Mr. Moggridge’s last words at Ludlow, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it must be, as I understand him, to some part of  Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to be more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my remarks do not apply. Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants of the alleged sin-eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that the "more odious part of the custom has been removed," which amounts to begging the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly admits that he never witnessed the “horrid custom” at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs us that it “was said to have prevailed:” he does not mention his authorities, nor does he so much as hint what means his informants had of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no disrespect to him when I say that both the vicar and the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascertaining the facts of the case, on account of their connexion with the locality and their knowledge of the vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge’s opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of facts; and opinions, from whatever source they may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. The question at issue lies within the domain of fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge has any foundation on a more solid substance than "imagination all compact."
>
> It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to “refresh” my memory respecting “the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scapegoat.” It is useless to argue about what may, could, or should have occurred, when we are concerned only with what has actually taken place. It is needless to expatiate on the possibility of a custom, when its existence is denied. The writer might have spared his sneering remark about: the "treason" of calling Welshmen "ignorant" and "superstitious." The qualities denoted by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are not confined to the Principality of Wales; and one at least of these benighted barbarians holds that it is treason against truth to make charges that cannot be substantiated against any nation, however "ignorant" or "superstitious" that nation may be. The writer seems to assume that it is “a point of national honour,” rather than any higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate groundless imputations. When “ national honour” and truth go together, “ national honour” is not to be contemned.
>
> The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on ac- count of his incognito. He need not. It is perfectly immaterial whether he retains or doffs it; but it shall not shield him from the  consequences of making statements of questionable authenticity. He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales"; but he does not tell us that his ‘ancestors ever furnished him with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or that in his frequent visits to our benighted country he ever encountered that dread functionary. Such being the case, I confess to being a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees and broad acres in two or more counties, fine things as they are, to the subject we are now dis- cussing. More to the point is the admission that, notwithstanding his frequent travels "over most of the Principality" he has "failed to acquire its language," that language being the very key to its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, therefore, must resemble those of a blind man in quest of the beautiful.
>
> If the writer proves, as he states in *Blackwood*, that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is "still surviving in North and South Wales," I shall at once confess my error, and the "national honour" shall take its chance; but if he fails to do this, he ought, in justice to the country of his "ancestry," to retract the groundless charge. He it is that has brought the accusation against it, and on him lies the burden of proof.

The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office— that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and ever.'

The custom of placing a late of salt on the breast of a dead person is, I imagine, not obsolete in this county yet; at any rate instances have occurred within my own knowledge.

I presume Mr. Morris quotes at second-hand, or he would have seen that he has only unearthed old Aubrey's "long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal." for, in the passage immediately before Roscoe’s quotation, the author says :— “Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom (but I have an idea by Mr. Kyrle, the 'Man of Ross'), which describes a 'Sin-Eater,' who 'lived by Ross highway, and is described as a 'gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor raskal.'"

> If your readers will refer to Mr. Fitzgerald's letter on November 20, 1875, they will see that the "poor raskals" are identical; and Mr. Downes, the author of the Mountain Decameron (who dates his book "Builth, Breconshire, April, 1836 "), does not profess to do more than pen a fancy sketch on Aubrey’s text, laying his scene in Cardiganshire.

> THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES.
>
> The Rev. Professor Silvan Evaus, B.D., of Llanymawddwy, has contributed another letter to the Academy in disproof of the absurd statements which have been forthcoming respecting the alle-eo functions of the imaginary "Sin-Eater":—
>
> THE "SIN-EATER."
>
> Llanymawddwy, Feb. 12, 1876.
>
> The question between the writer in *Blackwood* and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find that in his letter in the *Academy* of to-day he mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, leaving the point at issue just where it was. He stated in his article that the custom of the sin-eater prevails in north and south Wales at the present day; when I challenged that statement and asked for proof, we were told that by the present day he means some thirty years ago; and when pressed for the locality he goes under the aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebie "in the hill country of Carmarthenshire." When persons appeal to certain tribunals, they should not complain if they are sent to appear before the tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made on the spot by competent persons; and those who will take the trouble to read my last letter will see with what success. The Sin-Eater is as little known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. Now the writer shifts his ground and moves under the enlightening guidance of Murray's *Handbook for Travellers in South Wales*, to Cwm Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The compiler of that volume, whether ever "connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works" or not, states nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal knowledge of any informants, but quotes almost the identical words of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight variation as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the February number of the *Contemporary Review*, simply relates the same story over again, without any corroboration of her own. A false story does not become truth by repeti-tion, and these repetitions add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is simply waste of space to retail them.
>
> The writer complains that I did not turn over a certain leaf in *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, where he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeologists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating was carried on at *Llandebie until five years of that time* (1852). The leaf had been turned over and read before I wrote my last letter; I turn it over again, and on it read the last utterances of Mr. Moggridge as follows:—
>
> "Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of Sin-Eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped and the rest still retained; and as he advanced'still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now."

I allude particularly to the customs of watch. ing ever the dead in the manner called by the Irish wikingthe placing of salt on the breast of the corpse, and the perform. ance of the sin eater. I am told that these customs were still prevalent in Carmarthenshire, and other like neighbourhoods strongly Welsh, within a few years back. Do they still prevail P A late number of the Dublin University Magazine represented the customs of this kind in Yorkshire as being only just extinct. No doubt your correspondents in Carmarthenshire could en. lighten me as regards the same here; or the learned" Morien" might consent to devote a paragraph or two to the subject, which is full of interest to readers who have come to Wales from other parts.

When refreshment had been offered and declined, he said, "You must have some bread and salt,” with some remarks to imply that it was the way to establish a friendship. These were then brought in and eaten, without anything to lead one to suppose that this was an unusual custom at the house. Was this a practic peculiar to himself or to his family? or is such custom prevalent in the North, or in any other part of England? I have not met with it else-where.

> and, however it may have been limited to the clergy in early ages, was afterwards continued, and practised as profession, certain persons called sin eaters. In letter from John Bagford, dated 1715, printed in *Leland's Collectanea*, there is the following account of sin eater:— "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire in those villages adjoining to Wales when a person died, there was notice given to an old 'sire' (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him groat which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread which ate; and a full bowl of ale which drank off at a draught. After this he got from the cricket, and pronounced with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul." Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum are statements, in Aubrey's own handwriting, to the same purport.

Superstition has a far-reaching pedigree. A similar practice, initiated by Orphic priests, is continued by ignorant Papists (who servilely copied most if not all of the follies of paganism), and is found existing in Shropshire villages in the 18th century.

> SIN EATERS (Jmnoary lift, 1879). "Proud Salopian" asks (Janaary 1st, 1879) for proof respecting this practice. If he will refer to *Shreds and Patches* of Ang. 14th. last year, he will see what authority I relied on. In Brand’s *Popular Antiquities* vol ii., p. 155-6, quarto edition of 1813, he will find all the proof which can be given ; and Bagford adds, "How can a man think otherwise of this than that it proceeded from the ancient Heathens?" Aubrey further remarks. "In the county of Hereford was an old Custome at Funeralls hire poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskal) I remember lived in Cottage Rosse high-way The manner was that when the Corps waa brought out of the House and layd on the Biere, a Loafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of Beer (which he was to drink up), and Sixpence in money: in consideration whereof he took upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This Custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape Goate in the old Lawe— Levit. chap xvi , v 21. 22. 'And Aaron shall lay,' &c. This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government; as at Dynder (*volens nolens*, the Parson of the Parish) the Kindred Woman deceased there had this punctually performed according to her Will: and, also, the like was done at the City of Hereford in those times, where a Woman kept, many yeares before her death, a Mazard Bowle for the Sinne-Eater; and the like in other places in this Countie: as also in Brecon (a). I believe Custom was heretofore used all over Wales (b)

> THIS is, to us, one of the most attractive books of the season. Not only has Mr. Sykes carefully culled from published sources —such as Peter Roberts's Cambrian Antiquities, Jones's "Apparations,""Cymru Fu," "Cambro Briton," "Bye-gones" "Archaeologia Cambrensis" all that relates to his subject, but he has gone about amongst the people of South Wales for himself, and taken down from the lips of the elders there old stories of bye-gone customs and once prevalent superstitions. May be that the author places too much confidence in some of those narratives; whether he does or not, they add greatly to the interest of his book, and readers can judge for themselves how much to put under the head of "national superstitions," and how much to the credit merely of the foolish fancies of the narrators. We are glad to see that Mr. Sykes has investigated the "Sin Eater" fable. We don't believe an instance of this practice was ever proved to have been observed in Wales, or Shropshire either, and the author, after giving all the "illustrations" he can gather, says:-

Originally the reason for the exclusion of dogs and cats arose from the belief that, if either of these animals should chance to leap over the corpse, and be afterwards permitted to live, the devil would gain power over the dead person.

> When the corpse was laid out, a plate of salt was placed upon the breast, ostensibly to prevent the body swelling. Many did so in this belief, but its original purpose was to act as a charm against the devil to prevent him from disturbing the body. In some localities the plate of salt was supplemented with another filled with earth. A symbolical meaning was given for this ; that the earth represented the corporeal body, the earthly house, — the salt the heavenly state of the soul. But there was an older superstition which gave another explanation for the plate of salt on the breast. There were persons calling themselves "*sin eaters*" who, when a person died, were sent for to come and eat the sins of the deceased. When they came, their *modus operandi* was to place a plate of salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse, and repeat a series of incantations, after which they ate the contents of the plates, and so relieved the dead person of such sins as would have kept him hovering around his relations, haunting them with his imperfectly purified spirit, to their great annoyance, and without satisfaction to himself. This form of superstition has evidently a close relation to such forms of ancestor-worship as we know were practised by the ancients, and to which reference has already been made.

> Until the funeral, it was the practice for some of the relations or friends to sit up all night, and watch the corpse. In my young days this duty was generally undertaken by youtiis, male and female friends, who volunteered their services; but these watchings were not accompanied by the unseemly revelries which were common in Scotland in earlier times, or as are still practised in Ireland. The company sitting up with the corpse generally numbered from two to six, although I have myself been one of ten. They went to the house about ten in the evening, and before the relations went to bed each received a glass of spirits ; about midnight there was a refreshment of tea or ale and bread, and the same in the morning, when the relations of the deceased relieved the watchers. Although during these night sittings nothing ubbefitting the solemnity of the occasion was done, the circumstances of the meeting gave opportunity for love-making. The first portion of the night was generally passed in reading, — some one reading aloud for the benefit of the company, afterwards they got to story-telling, the stories being generally of a ghostly description, producing such a weird feeling, that most of the company durst hardly look behind them for terror, and would start at the slightest noise. I have seen some so affected by this fear that they would not venture to the door alone if the morning was dark. These watchings of the dead were no doubt efficacious in perpetuating superstitious ideas.
>
> The reasons given for watching the corpse differed in different localities. The practice is still observed, I believe, in some places ; but probably now it is more the result of habit — a custom followed without any basis of definite belief, and merely as a mark of respect for the dead ; but in former times, and within this century, it was firmly held that if the corpse were not watched, the devil would carry off the body, and many stories were current of such an awful result having happened One such story was told me by a person who had received the story from a person who was present at the wake where the occurrence happened. I thus got it at second hand. The story ran as follows ; — The corpse was laid out in a room, and the watchers had retired to another apartment to partake of refreshments, having shut the door of the room where the corpse lay. While they were eating there was heard a great noise, as of a struggle between two persons, proceeding from the room where the corpse lay. None of the party would venture into the room, and in this emergency they sent for the minister, who came, and, with the open Bible in his hand, entered the room and shut the door. The noise then ceased, and in about ten minutes he came out, lifted the tongs from the fireplace, and again re-entered the room. When he came out again, he brought out with the tongs a glove, which was seen to be bloody, and this he put into the fire. He refused, however, to tell either what he had seen or heard; but on the watchers returning to their post, the corpse lay as formerly, and as quiet and unruffled as if nothing had taken place, whereat they were all surprised.

> British Goblins, Welsh Folk Lore, Fairy Mythology% Legends, and Traditions. By Wirt Sikes, United Statel Consul for Wales. (London Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, Fleet-street). It has been known for several months past that Mr. Wirt Sikes. who has written so much about Wales and its people in the American magazines, was engaged upon an important work treating of a most picturesque side of Welsh character. This work is now before us, in a handsome volume of 428 p.p. illustrated with several drawings full of life and movement from the pencil of a Welsh artist, Mr. T. H. Thomas. The scope of the volume is clearly indicated to sell by its title, given above. It is evidently the result of long study of Welsh literature, and of patient inquiry among the Welsh peasantry. It is divided into four books, entitled respectively "The Realm of Fasrie," "The Spirit World," "Quaint Old Customs." and "Bells, Wells, Stones, and Dragons." It is impossible in the limits at our disposal to do justice to a work of this character, but it may in general be said to cover the field of folk- lore somewhat exhaustively. While not intended to to deal with the legends of the Arthurian period, these are often and gracefully referred to for purposes of interesting comparison with what the author terms the "humble goblins," of Welsh fireside tails—th" fairies, ghosts, superstitious customs, and cromlech-hunting elves. Fairies are classified in five divisions, thus: Ellyllon. or elves: Coblynau, or mine fairies: Bwbachod, or household fairies Gwragedd Annwn, or fairies of the lakes and streams; and Gwyllion, or mountain fairies. Numberless fairy tales are told, either as taken down from the lips of the peasantry with whom the author has conversed in his rambles about the Princi- pality, or translated from rare and curious old Welsh volumes. As an example of the latter, taken almost at random, we may quote the following Once more this legend appears, this time with a feature I have nowhere else encountered in fairy land, to wit, the father of a fairy damsel. The son of a farmer on Drws Coed Farm was, one fogey day, looking after his father's sheep, when crossing a marshy meadow he beheld a little lady behind some rising ground. She had yellow hair, blue eyes, and rosy cheeks. He approached her, and asked permi-sion to converse whereupon she smiled sweetly and said to him, Idol of my hopes, you have come at last I" They there and then begun to "keep company," and met each other rh,i]y here and there along the farm meadows. His intentions were honourable he desired her to marry him He was sometimetl absent for days together, no one knew where, and his friends whi-pered about that he had been witched. Around the Turf Lake (Llyn y Dyw. rc'ueni was a grove of trees, and under one of these one day fairy promised to be his. The consent of her father was now necessary. One moonlight night an appointment was made to meet in this wood. The father and daughter did not appear till the moon had dis- appeared behind the hill. Then they both came. The fiiry father immediately gave his consent to the marriage, (HI one condition, namely, that her future husband should never hit her with iron. If ever thou dost touch her flesh with iron she shall be no more thine. but she shnll return to her own." They were married—a good-looking pair. Large sums of money were brought by her. the night before she we idinsr. to Drw Coed. The shepherd lad became wealthy, had several luwàsome children, and they were very haopy. After some years, they were one day out riding, when her horse funk in a deep mire, and by the assistance of her husband, in her hurry to remount, she was struck on her knee by the stirrup of the saddle. Immediately voices were heard singing' on the brow of the hill, and she disappeared, leaving- all her children be- hind. She and her mother devised a plan by wh eh she could see her beloved, but as she was not allowed to walk the earth wiih man, they floated a large turf on the lake, and on this turf she stood for hours at a time holding converse with her husband. continued until his death. In Book II., "The Spirit World," the author has managed to bring together a collection of the most blood-freezing ghost stories that we have ever had the pleasure of coming across. We have little doubt this will be with many readers the most popular part < .f the book. The ghosts are also regularly classified, and comparisons drawn between these and like creature of popular fancy in other lands. The chapters on death- omens are especially absorbing, delineating the peculiari- ties of the corpse candle, the yicarch yrhHyyn, the U.lucth, the teidu, or goblin funeral, and many others. It is on this head observed— That these various portents are extensively believed in at the present day there cannot be a doubt; with regard to the most important of them. I am able to testify with the fullest freedom; I have heard regarding them story after story, from the lips of narrators whose incerity wa expressed vividly in face, tone. and behaviour. The excited eye, the pai n? cheek, the bated breath, the sinking voice, the intense and absorbed manner—familiar phenomena in every circle where ghost storie are toJd-{>i¡]cllced the perfect sincerity, a least, cl the speakers. It is unueccessary here to repeat, what I for my own prt never foreet, nor, I trust, does the re&0(>r, that Wales is no exception to the rest of the world in itscredniity. That it is more picturesque is true, and it is also true that there is here an unusual amount of legend which has not hitherto found its way into books. A pleasant change of subject is found in the Third Book," where a large number of quaint old customs are described. The sin-eater, custom long associated with Wales by writers in this field, is treated off at some length, and the evidence pro and con regarding it care- fully collated. It is evident that Mr. Wirt Sikes, in the true spirit of scientific inquiry, has no preco: calved theory to establish, and he frankly says he can find no evidence that there ever was such a custom in Wales. The subject has engaged my attention from the first moment I set foot on Cambrian soil, and I have not only seen no reference to it in Welsh writings, but I have never met any unlettered Welshman who had never heard of it. "Concerning the custom of bundling (courting a-bed), on the other hand, his testimony is that it is still practised in certain rural neighbourhoods of Wales. He adds "It is only by breathing the very atmosphere of an existance whose primitive influences we may thus ourselves feel, that we can get a just conception of underlying forces which govern a custom like this. Of course it is sternly con- demned by every advanced moralist, t-ven in the neighbourhoods where it prevails." An instance of bundling is given which came to the author's know- ledge so lately as 1877. In this connection he pertinently recalls certain laws of the ancient Brit"ns regarding courtship, which were so severe that" any other issue to courtship than marriage was practically impossible." Many of the quaint old customs in Wales, our author tells us, while they "appear to be meaning- less, to people of average culture, are in truth replete with meaning:" However trivial they may seem, they are very seldom the offspring of mere fooling. The student of comparative folk- lore is oftel1 able to trace their origin with surprising dis- tinctness, anù to evolve from them a significance before UB- suspected. In many cases these customs are traced to the primeval mythology. Others are clearly seen to be of Druidical origin. Many spring from the rites Rnd 01)':r. -uœs of the Roman Catholic Church in the early days of Chris- tianity on Welsh soil—where, as is now generally conceded- the Gospel was first preached in Great Britain. Som", em- body historical traditions, and wme are the outgrowth of peculiar states of ociety in medieval times, DJreciJy ;>- j: directly, they are all associated with superstition, though in many instances they have quite lost any superstitous charac- ter in our day. Among those which the author considers to be of Papal origin, but which have now no moral significance is the following :— Among Twelfth Night customs none is more cp; ,hr.l7>:>d than that called Mary Lwyd. It prevails in various parts of Wales, notably in Lower Glamorganshire. The skeleton of a horse's head is procured by the young men or boys of a village, and adorned with "favour-" of pink, blue, yellow, &c. These are generally borrowed from the girls, as it is not considered necessary the silken fillets and rosettes should be new, and such finery costs money. The bottoms of two black bottles are inserted in the sockets of the skeleton head to serve as eyes, and a substitute for ears is also contrived. On Twelfth Night they ca-rry this object about from house to house, with shouts and songs, and a general cultivation of noise and racket. Sometimes a duet is sung in Welsh, outside a door, the singers begging to be invited in; if the door be not opened they tap on it, and there is frequently quite a series of awen sung, the parties within denying the outsiders admission, and the outsiders urging the same. At last the door is opened, when in bounces the merry crowd, them the Mary Lwyd, borne by oue personating a hor-e, who is led by another personating the groom. The horse chases the girls around the room, capering and neighing, whil.: the groom cries, "So ho, my boy—gently, poor felJow:" and Le girls, of course, scream with merriment. A dance foil ,ws—a reel, performed by three young men, tricked eut with The company is then regaled with cakes and ale, and tue- revellers depart, pausing outside the door to sing a parting song of thanks and good wishes to their entertainers. British Goblins is evidently the work of an author well versed in the folk-lore of other countries, especially in that of Germany and Scandinavia. The copious in- dex at the end of the volume, and the lists of contents before each chapter, add much to the usefulness of the book. It is dedicated, most appropriately, to the Prince of Wales, and its popularity in Wales is certain to be great—not because all the author's views will be entirely agreed with, but because of the amount of information it affords on many subjects hitherto little known, the deeply interesting materials of which it is composed and the sympathetic and generous appreciation of aj that is best in the Welsh character which Mr. Wirt Sikes has so constantly displayed in his literary work.
