# The First Controversy, 1875

The response to the article in *Blackwood's Magazine*, and in particular the mention of "the sin-eater", begins with the Vol 8 Iss 182 edition *The Academy*, dated [November 6th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-06_8_182/page/478/mode/2up?q=legends), on p. 478

> AMONG curious customs and superstitions noticed in an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folk-lore of North Wales" there is one the singularity of which is heightened by the statement that it still survives in North and South Wales and the Border. At a funeral, "a hireling who lives by such services has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from walking after death." The scapegoat is currently called a "Sin-eater."

## An Initial Response, Silvan Evans, 1875-11-13

In the following issue ([Vol 8 Iss 183, November 13th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-13_8_183/page/504/mode/2up?q=legends)), the first piece of correspondence appears, from a certain *D. SILVAN EVANS*, on p.506. Silvan Evans had presumably picked up notice of the item in the previous edition of the *Academy*:

> Correspondence

> "LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES."

> Llanymawddwy Rectory, Merioneth: November 8, 1875.
>
> In the ACADEMY of November 6 (p. 478) I find an extract from an article in Blackwood on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales," referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral "a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maple bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpence, in consideration of which he takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees him or her from *walking* after death;" and this functionary, it is added, is currently called a "Sin-eater." The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality. If the writer of the article will give me the name of any locality where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquiries on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends.

> D. SILVAN EVANS.

At the time of writing, Daniel Silvan Evans was an ordained priest and scholar, author and editor of several Welsh language works including an English and Welsh dictionary. He was also just at the end of his term of editing *Archaeologia Cambrensis* (1871-1875), the journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, which may be recalled as the venue for Matthew Moggridge's observations on the sin eater in 1852.

The letter expresses a certain amount of doubt as to the veracity of the "alleged" tradition, based on the author having lived for a quarter of a century in the principality in an occupation that *"often brings me in contact with funerals"* and having *"never found a trace of such a custom"*.

Silvan Evans then goes on to request further information on sources and locations and offers to visit the location to pursue further investigations. He also asks for the " *Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater"'* as one *"interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends"*. 

A reprinted version of Silvan Evans letter to the *Academy* also appeared *The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard*, published on [November 19th, 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3307679/3307686/41/sin-eater), p7, introduced as:

> LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES.- The following letter has appeared in the Academy. "Llanymawddwy Rectory. Merioneth November 8th, 1875. In the *Academy*of November 6th, (p 478) I find ...

## Response to Silvan Evans, Historical Evidence, 1875-11-20

The next issue of the *Academy*, Vol 8 Iss 18 dated [November 20th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-20_8_184), pp. 529-30, has a response that recaptures must of the evidence that we are familiar with. It is restated here to provide a concise benchmark for the state of understanding we might have expected from the participants from this point in the debate.

> "LEGENDS AND FOLK-LORE OF NORTH WALES": THE SIN-EATER, Hammersmith : Nov. 16, 1875.
>
> Professor Evans has "never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period." May I be allowed to point out what appears to be the original passage from which the writer of the article drew the authority for his statement, and apparently its very words ? It occurs in a work so well-known as *Brand's Popular Antiquities* (Bohn's edition, 1849, vol. ii. 246-248), where the following is cited from Bagford’s letter, dated February 1, 1714-5, in Leland's *Collectanea*, i. 76 :—
>
> "Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he eat; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq."
>
> The following words of Aubrey’s own are then quoted :—
>
> "In the county of Hereford was an old custome at funeralls to hire poor peopie, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. Ono of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal) I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layd on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne eater, over the corpse, as also a mazar bowlo, of muple, full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money; in consideration whereof he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the scapegoate in the old lawe, Levit. xvi. 21, 22. . . . This custome, though rarely used in our dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the presbyterian government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the parson of the parish), the kindred of a woman deceased there had this cere- monie punctually performed, according to her will: and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many yeares before her death, a mazard bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales." (*Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaism.* Lansdowne MSS. 226, fol. 116.)
>
> In a note the same writer adds that at Llanggors, Brecon, about 1640, Mr. Gwin, the minister, "could not hinder the performance of this ancient custome." And he says in another page of the MS. cited: "A.D. 1686. This custom is used to this day in North Wales."
>
> While these statements very clearly affirm the former prevalence, in North Wales and the Border, of the superstitious practice in question, they do not, of course, go to show that, in the words of the article, it is "still surviving" in those localities, as well as in South Wales. The writer, however, of the interesting compilation in *Blackwood* has little to tell us about surviving North Welsh superstitions, and less that is new. Some of those mentioned (e.g., that about pigeon's feathers, and the Bible and key or sieve spell to find'a thief) are common in various parts of England and Scotland; others, like the *Canwyll Corph* (Corpse Candle), are more or less satisfactorily referred to in well-known works— as in the *Choice Notes from Notes and Queries*, and in the old *Cambrian Quarterly Magazine*; other remarkable superstitions, again, alleged to be still living, such as that of the *Mallt y Nos*, or *Mam y Drwg* (Mother of Mischief), are not mentioned.
>
> I venture to remark that the popular superstitions of Wales still await a student, acquainted with the Welsh language, and content, instead of seeking *folk*-lore from books, to collect it at the firesides of the people, in the out-of-the-way villages and secluded glens where it lingers longest. David Fitzgerald.
>

There is a second piece of correspondence, immediately following (p530), that adds a further reference to Hone's *Year Book*:

> Croeswylan, Oswestry.
> In reference to the strange profession of "Sin-Eater," mentioned by the writer in *Blackwood* and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans, let me refer him and your readers to a well-known work, Hone's *Year Book*, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in *Blackwood* resides. Askew Roberts.

Askew Roberts, you might recall, was the original editor of Bye-gones, launched in 1871, the hyperlocal *Notes & Queries* of its time for Oswestry and the border counties of England and Wales.

We also get a first hint here that Askew Robers, at least, has a good idea about whom the author of the article might be.

```{admonition} Askew Roberts, citing Hone
:class: dropdown

> The following is the information given by Hone in his *Year Book*, col. 858:— According to Lawrence Howell, *History of the Pontificate*, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, "They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, however, Sin Eating has been a very much more vulgar affair, and a letter from John Bagford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's *Collectanea*, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:—
>
> Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to Wales, when a person died, there was notice given to an old "sire," (for so they called him) who presently repaired to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the door of the house, when some of the family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which he ate; a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. After this he got up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a composed gesture, "the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would pawn his own soul."
>
> Bagford states that he received his information from "the ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounts of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own handwriting. In these he tells of "a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a professional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon "at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

Askew Roberts letter in the *Academy* also appears in *The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard*, published on [November 26th, 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3307690/3307699/76/sin-eater), p9, along with the elaboration of the reference in Hone's *Year Book*.


## The Blackwood Author Replies, 1875-11-27

A week after the first response to Silvan Evans' letter in the Academy, and two weeks after that letter appeared, in  Vol 8 Iss 185 dated [November 27th, 1875](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1875-11-27_8_185/page/554/mode/2up?q=sin+eater), p555, the anonymous *Blackwood* author goes on the defensive in their response – their *retort* - to the Reverend, addressing him almost as if he were a poorly read schoolboy who hadn't done his prep:

> THE SIN-EATER. November 20, 1875.
>
> Mr. Silvan Evans's ignorance of the superstition of the "Sin-eater" as connected with Wales and the Border counties surprises me the more as he has been for some years editor of the *Cambrian Archaeological Journal*; and during those years, if I mistake not, the second series of that valuable work has been carefully indexed.

The author then instructs the naughty schoolboy as to where to look for the answer:

> If he will turn to Ser. II., vol. iii. pp- 330, *seq.*, he will find that at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852 Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire.

The patronising tone continues with an explanation of how the answer should be interpreted, explaining any delay in responding to Silvan Evan's initial letter as a result of a last minute search for a more contemporary example (which by implication Silvan Evans should have found if her weren't so lazy), but which the author, in fact, doesn't find either:

> That which can be pointed to within a generation back may be said, speaking broadly, to "survive" or linger still; and I have only delayed writing these remarks in the hopes of hunting up a paper where, early in the present year, I found a notice of a still later case.

To reinforce Silvan Evans' laziness, the anonymous correspondent points out that several other boys managed to do the homework all on their own:

> Other of your correspondents have relieved me of the necessity of referring to instances of the "Sin-eater" custom cited by Leland, Aubrey, and others, as having occurred between 1686 and 1715 in three or four Herefordshire parishes, in Shropshire, *in the villages adjoining Wales*, at Llangorse, near Brecon, and elsewhere in North and South Wales.

In adopting his superior tone, the author then responds, mockingly it seems, that they can't speak Welsh and never pretended to be able to. And that while their education may be lacking in this respect, the implication in tone is that they still knows how to do their homework properly.

> I regret that my ignorance of Welsh precludes me from giving Mr. Evans the Welsh equivalent for the term. My article in *Blackwood* pretends to no such knowledge, though I regret, as a Borderer, that my education herein is imperfect.

The *Blackwood* author then tries a rheterical trick of suggesting they will be more than pleased if further contemporary evidence comes to hand, (suggesting by omission that they have already provided more than enough such evidence anyway), and they will happily then provide it to the *Academy* themself.

> Should I be able to trace the custom to a still later date than 1848 or 1852, no one will be better Pleased than myself to communicate the fact to the Academy.

In signing off, the author continues to maintain their anonymity:

> The Author of a paper on "LEGENDS AND FOLK-LORE OF NORTH WALES in "Blackwood’s Magazine" For November.

> In reply to Rev. D Sdvan Evans, the accuser says the case was under consideration brian Archaeologists in Ludlow, in 1852, when one Mr. Moggridge to the over-zealous cause where, within five years, at ecod near Llandebie, Carmarthenshire I Accused, the custom in Wales was said to be present, but when the test is called for it will go back to a maximum of 30 years. 30 years in this period is more than two hundred years ago. But although he returned to 1847, he could not tell us whether or not the circumstance took place in or near Llandebia whether at Llandilo fawr, Cwmdwr, Pontardulais, or elsewhere. But though he did specify a time and place, we assure him pf, Mr. Moggridge, and everyone else, did not take the Yes circumstance there within me of the older inhabitants. It is customary in some Welsh times before commencing with the body from the house to go for beer and cakes for the essentials, before gathering to assist in digestion; and it is highly probable that the scholar Moggridge assumed that this was the custom of his own nation's fool. It is very interesting to see a few superficial and fast antiquaries discussing subject houses. Great care must be taken with things that hold a close connection to a nation. Many factions belong to us as Welshmen, and turn our backs willingly to the scourge, but let us not be insulted for things or belonging to us, and that by a nation whose sacred place is sacred to superstition.

Although archival copies of the *Western Mail* do not appear in the digital archives (scans for [July to December 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/browse/3980151) are missing from the National Library of Wales newspaper archive collection), a note in Bye-Gones of [December 22, 1875](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2093566/11#?xywh=-1479%2C-194%2C5791%2C3820), also reprinted in *The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard*, dated [December 24th, 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3307734/3307743/72/sin-eater), p9, contains an excerpt of a letter to that publication of December 16th, 1875, from a certain "RHEIDIOL" that also claims not to have witnessed or found evidence of the tradition, despite having been a collector of folklore in the area:

> THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)- The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter signed RHEIDIOL, Twmbarlwn, on this subject, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer proceeds to say :- I lived at Llandebie many years ago, and I am well acquainted with the history of that parish and its customs and traditions, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a thing. I am well acquainted with Welsh lore in almost every parish in South Wales, which I collected for the late Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little superstitious, but he is far too intelligent to believe in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Association, that they have better foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

A second letter from the same correspondent appeared in *The Aberystwith Observer* of December 18th, 1875](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3040691/3040694/15/sin%20eater), p3:

> THE "SIN EATER" IN WALES.
>
> *To the Editor of the Aberystwyth Observer.*
>
> SIR.—The old saying is very true "if you want to hear news you must go from homo." Now we have received a strange piece of news, that we have a "Sin Eater" in connection with funerals in Wales. Some years ago, I was employed by an eminent antiquary to collect old Welsh legends, traditions and customs. I have made researches in almost every parish in South Wales but I never heard of the "Sin Eater."
>
> We are told this custom prevailed at Llandebe, in Carmarthenshire.
>
> I went to reside in that village in 1850; and I lived there for six years. My avocation brought me in contact with all the parishioners I knew them well, and I am well acquainted with the history of the place, its customs and traditions. I attended many funerals, but this Sin Eater never cropped up; and I never saw cakes distributed at funerals.
>
> The Welsh people are, it is true, in some localities a little tainted with superstition, as to ghosts &c., but they are not so superstitious as the importations who cross the "Severn Sea" to South Wales they are too well acquainted with their Bibles as to believe in such a thing as a "Sin Eater."
>
> We are told that this was maintained at the Cambrian Society's meeting held at Ludlow in 1852; if such trash as this be accepted by antiquarians as facts, their knowledge of the Principality must be very limited; and I pity their ignorance of Welsh history and traditions.
>
> I thank the Rev. Daniel S. Evans, of Llany-Mawddwy, for calling attention to this rank libel on Welshmen.
>
> I am, sir, yours faithfully,
>
> RHEIDIOL.

```{admonition} Who Was "Rheidiol"?

At this point, the identity of "Rheidiol" is not clear, but we do have various snippets of information about them:

- their address: *Twmbarlwn*;
- they resided in "Llandebe" (*Llandebie*) from 1850 to 1856;
- they were "employed by an eminent antiquary to collect old Welsh legends, traditions and customs".

We also note that they "attended many funerals", which may be as a result of their profession or their standing in the community.

[Discussion on a paper "On the Belief in Bhutas—Devil and Guost Worship in Western India., pp408- By M. J. Watnovsz, F.R.A.S."]

> Mr. Moggridge said : Mention was made of superstitious observances in our own island. I may, therefore, be permitted to bring to your notice a curious custom that not long since was still extant in South Wales and some of the adjoining counties, that of the Sin-eater. More than two centuries ago a well-known writer, Aubrey de Gentilésisme gives a full account of this observance in Herefordshire, where he was fortunate enough to "interview" the Sin-eater himself. Among the mountains of South Wales I find a similar ceremony prevailing down to almost our own times. When a person died, the Sin-eater of the district was called in. On his arrival he received a plate, on which he poured some salt. Upon the salt he placed a piece of bread, laid the plate on the chest of the defunct, muttered words of charmed power while bending over the corse, then eat the bread, whereby he eat up and appropriated to himself all*the sins of the deceased, received two shillings and sixpence for his services, and quickly retired from the pitying gaze of are present, who regarded him as one utterly and irremediably lost.
>
> Mr. Jeremiah said: I was very much interested in the paper just read. With reference to the alleged custom of *sin-eating* in Wales, mentioned by Mr. Moggridge, I would remark that the discussion raised by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans in the (November 5, 1875) appears to have gone adrift for want of the Welsh word for *Sin-eater*. The discussion arose, as all must be aware, from a statement made by a writer in *Blackwood's Magazine* for last month, in an article on the Legend and Folk-lore of North Wales,' where he says, in reference to a funeral custom, that the "Scapegoat . . . is currently called a 'sin-eater.'" Dr. Evans demanded the Welsh equivalent, which the author of that article could not give, in consequence of, he says, "my ignorance of Welsh." (Academy, Nov. 27, p. 555.) Had he referred to Bingley’s "North Wales," vol. ii. p. 278, he would have seen a way out of his difficulty, and a clear answer to the query put by Dr. Evans; and Mr. Moggridge will also see, I think, that the custom was not known as sin-eating, although the original meaning may have been of that nature. Bingley says, "It is usual in several parts of North Wales for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person of the same sex, and nearly the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment, and in some instances for weeding and adorning it on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called Diodlys, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where, at the same time, the body is standing ona bier. It had its name from a custom, which is now discontinued (1804), of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceed with the body to the church." It appears, then, that the custom means simply a "gift of ale or beer," and not *sin-eating*. Pennant’s (in his "Tours in Wales," vol. iii. p. 159, edition 1810) account is slightly different. He says: "Previous to a funeral it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next-of-kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter—for it must be a female—to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves in a t dish, and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and required the person to drink a little of it *immediately*. When that was done they kneeled down, and the minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer, after which they proceeded with the corpse, and at every crossway between the house and the church they laid down the bier and knelt, and again repeated the Lord's Prayer, and did the same when they first entered the churchyard." This custom,
and that of the alleged sin-eating, are conclusively one and the same, viz. that of Diodlys.
> 
> Mr Edkins and the President also made a few remarks.

We have no record of what those remarks may have been.

> Correspondence The Sin-Eater, by Prof. D. Silvan Evans
>
> THE SIN-EATER.
>
> Aberystwyth : Jan. 29, 1876.
>
> At the risk of exposing my "ignorance" still further, and thereby causing additional surprise to the writer of the paper on the "Legends and Folklore of North Wales" in *Blackwood’s Magazine*, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. Like every other country, the Principality had, and still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-eater does not appear to be among them. Since the appearance of my former letter in the ACADEMY (November 13), I have made all the enquiries I could into the subject, with the view of ascertaining whether such a personage has, or ever had, “a local habitation and a name” among us. I have spoken to many and corresponded with several persons who are known to have paid attention to the customs and traditions of the country; and the sum of their communications is, without any exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater was as novel to them as it was to me.
>
> The writer points to Llandebie as the place where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. Matthew Moggridge at the annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Ludlow in 1852, and is "surprised" that I, who became connected with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* in 1872, should not be minutely acquainted with everything that appeared in that journal some twenty years previously, Whether I ever read the account of the Ludlow meeting I cannot now say; but if I did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge’s revelations had been effaced from my memory when I wrote my letter. The writer tells us that "at the meeting of the Cambrian archaeologists at Ludlow in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for sentiments which he never expressed. The description of the sin-eater, given by Mr. Moggridge, is taken from Aubrey; and the following are his words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, the organ of the Association :—
>
> "In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt."
>
> Out of this statement the author of the article makes “five years”! and by that process brings the custom down to 1847. Mr. Moggridge, in a letter dated the first day of the present year, tells me that he does “not remember anything that gives a date,” and adds that “the only written account” of the sin-eater "from *personal* knowledge is that of Aubrey, 'de Gentilisme.'" Aubrey, if I may rely on the extracts given in the ACADEMY, does not say that he was eyewitness to the performances of the sin-eater in any part of *Wales*, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as having prevailed at any time in the Principality; and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of the Principality and not of the English counties.
>
> But let us return to Llandebie, the locality in which it is asserted that the custom prevailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Rowlands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author of a small volume of *Historical Notes* published about ten years ago, and at one time librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these words :—
>
> "I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, customs, and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of the 'sin-eater;' in fact people there never give cakes at funerals. I know almost every parish in South Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth."
>
> Letters to the same effect appeared in the *Western Mail*, which circulates very extensively in the Principality, in the *Aberystwyth Observer*, and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin-eater.
>
> The Rev. Rees Evans, Vicar of Llandebie, has favoured me with the following letter in answer to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on the part of your readers for inserting it without abridgment :—
>
> "I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., which contained such extraordinary statements in reference to a superstitious custom supposed and alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the employment at funerals of a strange person called the 'sin-eater.' I have been the vicar of this parish for the last fourteen years, and I have known this neighbourhood well for the last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I received your letter of such a personage as the 'sin-eater.' However, with the view of arriving at the truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which appeared subsequently in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this parish, as to the probability of there having ever existed here such a functionary as 'sin-eater;' and the result of my investigation in the matter is this :—
>
> That such a custom as that alluded to in your letter never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had long conversations while investigating the matter in question for you. One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I have made, my candid opinion is that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any credible evidence."
>
> Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter of a century.
>
> The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge as being still seen in some parts have no connexion, or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin-eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are given for their employment. They are not uncommon, I understand, among Roman Catholics at the present day.
>
> The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just seen, he does not state that he saw any performance of the custom among the Welsh people. Those who only retail his statements need not detain us. I leave it to others to judge what amount of credibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part. If we put implicit belief in what he says about the sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, I do not see how we can consistently refuse his evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent.
>
> In conclusion I would remark that if the custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is somewhat strange, if not "surprising," that the discovery of it has been exclusively confined to those who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the country.

> There is a strange superstition concerning the "sin-eater." which remains in some secluded places, perhaps the echo of the idea of substitution for sin in the Jewish scapegoat. He presents himself, professionally, at the moment of death, puts a plate containing bread and salt on the breast of the corpse, mutters an incantation, and proceeds to eat the bread, thereby "eating up the sins of the dead," and especially preventing him, or her, from “walking” after death. The man who exercises this tremendous power is a sort of pariah, detested in the neighbourhood, and does his work for half-a-crown, and sometimes even goes as low as sixpence in his demands.
>
> Another instance of the extraordinary power which, it is supposed, can be exerted by very ordinary individuals, is accomplished by throwing oneself on one's knees and repeating the Cursing Psalms, when the dreadful wishes of David for his enemies are made to cling to the person thus prayed against. “The devil can quote Scripture” indeed. This Pagan and devilish use of the Bible, and the change of name, not of nature, which has taken place in many an ancient local deity, may still be met with in Brittany, where there was a Celtic goddess of Hate, now transmogrified into "Notre Dame de la Haine." If three *Aves* are uttered at nightfall in her chapel near Treguier, winged with the proper directions against the hated person, "death happens irrevocably within the year to him or her."

The Sin-Eater in Wales

The discussion on this subject, commenced in the *Academy*, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in *Bye-gones* towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the write of an article in *Blackwood*, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed; and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Combrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthanshore, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave in Dec. 1, 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are no informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the exitence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1875, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned; in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's connection.

> THE "SIN-EATER" IN WALES.
>
> February 8, 1876.
>
> I crave Mr. Silvan Evans's pardon for the hasty assumption that the editor of an Archaeological journal would possess or have access to a complete set of the past volumes, in which case he need not have denied in his first letter to the ACADEMY having ever heard of the Sin-eater in Wales, seeing that he now admits that if "he ever read Mr. Moggridge's revelations at Ludlow, they had been effaced from his memory" when he first wrote. To me he does not seem even now to have fully refreshed his memory; as after quoting a portion of Mr. Moggridge's remarks at the Ludlow meeting in 1862, and calling Mr. Moggridge as a witness, at this distance of time, that "he does not remember anything that gives a date," he takes me to task *for making "five years!" out of that statement, and by that process bringing the custom down to* 1847. Had Mr. Evans turned over a leaf and read the last words of Mr. Moggridge on the occasion referred to, he would have found that they were to the effect that "he believed people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice: one case, he was informed, *occurred four or five years ago; but he believed it was extinct now.*" Perhaps, had I not wished to be succinct, I should have given Mr. Moggridge's own words for the mountain valley in which, when he brought forward the subject in 1852, the practice was said to have existed till recently. But "at or near Llandebie" is a wide statement, and though the present vicar and the quondam schoolmaster may never have heard of the "Sin-eater," I am still disposed to believe that there must have been some foundation for Mr. Moggridge’s statement. Only last night, in the Introduction to Murray's *Handbook to South Wales*, 1870 (the editor of which I am unacquainted with, although I have an impression that he was a medical man of eminence, connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works), I came upon this paragraph in p. xxvii: "The superstition of the sin-eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman in Caermarthenshire." I refer to the Ordnance Maps, and find Cwm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary*, refers to the same superstition, and if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr. Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practise on their credulity and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not widely removed from others which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius on 1 Cor. iv. 13 traces one such in Caesar’s account of the Gauls, B. ix, 6. That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious. Mr. Silvan Evans's parting shot at the discoverers "who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and but slightly acquainted with the country," shall not draw me from my incognito, or I might show him that by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, I am connected with two counties of South Wales, and that I have travelled frequently over most of the Principality, although I have failed to acquire its language.

One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom in his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I have made, my candid opinion is that the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any credible evidence."
>
> Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter of a century.
>
> The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge as being still seen in some parts have no connection, or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin-eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are given for their employment. They are not uncommon, I understand, among Roman Catholics at the present day.
>
> The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just seen, he does not state that he saw any performance of the custom among the Welsh people. Those who only retail his statements need not detain us. I leave it to others to judge what amount of credibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey in any case in which superstition plays a part. If we put implicit belief in what he says about the sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, I do not see how we can consistently refuse his evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent.
>
> In conclusion I would remark that if the custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is somewhat strange if not "surprising," that the discovery of it has been exclusively confined to those who are ignorant of the language of the natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the country.

> THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> The discussion on this subject, commenced in the Academy, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in Bye-gones towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the writer of an article in Blackwood, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the "Sin-Eater" existed in the Principality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, whose connection with the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* was well known, should not be aware that Mr Moggridge had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom had prevailed at or near Llandebie, Caermarthenshire, within five years of that date. The substance of this we gave Dec 1. 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the *Western Mail* written, as we are now informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the existence of the practice in his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the *Academy*, Feb. 5, 1876, Mr Silvan Evans goes fully into the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Vicar of Llandebie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the "whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credulous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the organ of the Cambrian Archaeological Society commenced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's communication.

> The Sin-Eater, by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans and E. R. Morris.
>
> THE "SIN-EATER."
>
> Llanymawddwy : Feb. 12, 1876.
>
> The question between the writer in Blackwood and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find that in his letter in the Academy of to-day he mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, leaving the point at issue just where it was. He stated in his article that the custom of the Sin-Eater prevails in North and South Wales at the present day; when I challenged that statement and asked for proof, we were told that by the present day he means some thirty years ago; and when pressed for the locality he goes under the aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebi "in the hill-country of Carmarthenshire." When persons appeal to certain tribunals, they should not complain if they are sent to appear before the tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made on the spot by competent persons; and those who will take the trouble to read my last letter will see with what success, The Sin-Eater is as little known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. Now the writer shifts his ground and moves, under the enlightening guidance of Murray's *Handbook for Travellers in South Wales*, to Cwm Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The compiler of that volume, whether ever "connected with Monmouthshire Iron Works" or not, states nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal knowledge, or from the personal knowledge of any informants, but quotes almost the identical words of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight variation as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the February number of the Contemporary Review, simply relates the same story over again, without any corroboration of her own. A false story does not become truth by repetition, and these repetitions add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is simply waste of space to retail them.
>
> The writer complains that I did not turn over a certain leaf in the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, where he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeologists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating was carried on *at Llandebie until within five years of that time* (1852). The leaf had been turned over and read before I wrote my last letter; I turn it over again, and on it read the last utterances of Mr. Moggridge as follows :—
>
> "Mr. Moggridge said— Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of Sin-Eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped; and the rest still retained; and us he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thorough] ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now."
>
> These are Mr. Moggridge's last words at Ludlow, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it must be, as I understand him, to some part of  Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to be more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my remarks do not apply. Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants of the alleged sin-eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that the "more odious part of the custom has been removed," which amounts to begging the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly admits that he never witnessed the “horrid custom” at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs us that it “was said to have prevailed:” he does not mention his authorities, nor does he so much as hint what means his informants had of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no disrespect to him when I say that both the vicar and the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascertaining the facts of the case, on account of their connexion with the locality and their knowledge of the vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge’s opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of facts; and opinions, from whatever source they may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. The question at issue lies within the domain of fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge has any foundation on a more solid substance than "imagination all compact."
>
> It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to “refresh” my memory respecting “the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scapegoat.” It is useless to argue about what may, could, or should have occurred, when we are concerned only with what has actually taken place. It is needless to expatiate on the possibility of a custom, when its existence is denied. The writer might have spared his sneering remark about: the "treason" of calling Welshmen "ignorant" and "superstitious." The qualities denoted by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are not confined to the Principality of Wales; and one at least of these benighted barbarians holds that it is treason against truth to make charges that cannot be substantiated against any nation, however "ignorant" or "superstitious" that nation may be. The writer seems to assume that it is "a point of national honour," rather than any higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate groundless imputations. When" national honour" and truth go together, "national honour" is not to be contemned.
>
> The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on account of his incognito. He need not. It is perfectly immaterial whether he retains or doffs it; but it shall not shield him from the  consequences of making statements of questionable authenticity. He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales"; but he does not tell us that his ‘ancestors ever furnished him with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or that in his frequent visits to our benighted country he ever encountered that dread functionary. Such being the case, I confess to being a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees and broad acres in two or more counties, fine things as they are, to the subject we are now dis- cussing. More to the point is the admission that, notwithstanding his frequent travels "over most of the Principality" he has "failed to acquire its language," that language being the very key to its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, therefore, must resemble those of a blind man in quest of the beautiful.
>
> If the writer proves, as he states in *Blackwood*, that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is "still surviving in North and South Wales," I shall at once confess my error, and the "national honour" shall take its chance; but if he fails to do this, he ought, in justice to the country of his "ancestry," to retract the groundless charge. He it is that has brought the accusation against it, and on him lies the burden of proof.

As far as my readings to date go, there appears to be no further response from the anonymous *Blackwoood* author, and the major correspondence comes to an end.

But the debate was not quite over.

In the same issue...

> Homestay, Newtown, Montgomeryshire : February 12, 1876.
>
> Roscoe, in his *Wanderings and Excursions in South Wales*, quoting the author of the *Mountain Decameron*, locates "what is believed to have been the last Sin-Eater of Wales" differently from any mentioned in the Academy. I subjoin his remarks.
>
> "A gentleman who lived a little before the time of this dark superstition becoming obsolete (the earlier part of the last century) gives us this brief account of what is believed to have been the last 'Sin-Eater of Wales.'
>
> "'I got lost,' says he, 'near nightfall, after being landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey on the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black turbary of great extent divided me from the road. I was cautioned to ride far’ round this pitchy bog, for no horse ever ventured among the peat pits, the whole being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even without peril of being swallowed, man and horse.
>
> "'At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock of a rough road rung to my horse’s hoof, and I saw a cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a distance.
>
> "'The house was on a high point and turn of road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow ground.
>
> "'Just as I came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds of wailing within, and soon, a woman came out into the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay a corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit of bread placed on its breast. The woman was shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office— that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and ever.'
>
> "This is the traveller's account of this incident. He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman's long unanswered, till she kindled, on the high road’s point, the straw of her husband’s late bed—the usual signal of a death in the house.
>
> "The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel made of sea-wreck and nails of such, between sea-marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by day, none dare by night, whether for the footing, or the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that recluse."
>
> Persons acquainted with the district readily recognise the locality from the above description, others may do so when I state that the Cambrian Railway, between Machynlleth and Aberystwith, traverses the "black turbary of great extent," and the high road from Aberdovey passes close by one of the railway stations on this line, called "Ynyslas." The custom of placing a late of salt on the breast of a dead person is, I imagine, not obsolete in this county yet; at any rate instances have occurred within my own knowledge.

I presume Mr. Morris quotes at second-hand, or he would have seen that he has only unearthed old Aubrey's "long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal." for, in the passage immediately before Roscoe’s quotation, the author says :— “Mr. Fosbroke, in an account of the town of Ross, quotes a letter, I forget by whom (but I have an idea by Mr. Kyrle, the 'Man of Ross'), which describes a 'Sin-Eater,' who 'lived by Ross highway, and is described as a 'gaunt, ghastly, lean, miserable, poor raskal.'"
>
> If your readers will refer to Mr. Fitzgerald's letter on November 20, 1875, they will see that the "poor raskals" are identical; and Mr. Downes, the author of the Mountain Decameron (who dates his book "Builth, Breconshire, April, 1836 "), does not profess to do more than pen a fancy sketch on Aubrey’s text, laying his scene in Cardiganshire.

> Welsh Decameron
>
> The character of the *Mountain Decameron* as a work of fiction, its delineations of human nature devoid of credit, and its narratives of palpable improbabilities, will be best explained by the following review of it, which was published soon after its appearance.
>
> "While we praise the power and skill with which many parts of these tales are written ; the picturesque delineations of nature, the transcript of manners, and the general conduct of the fable; we must protest against the groundwork of the histories themselves, which are founded on circumstances, as that of Ruth and Marmaduke, most improbable and unnatural; as love growing up between a father and daughter, ignorant of their sacred relation to each other— their unhallowed hopes— their disappointment and their death of despair. Nearly all the stories are of the same cast, containing descriptions of strong uncontrollable passions, desperate resolves, fearful vicissitudes, and violent and tragic terminations. The skill with which such tales are written only adds to the evil they are too apt to occasion; and the sympathies they excite are so powerful and distressing, as to act most disadvantageously on the mind. If Mr Downes will take up another line of fiction, and delineate the milder feelings,— the gentler and softer affections, the less harrowing afflictions,— and will build them round the more endearing events of life, he will, we are sure, draw from them more useful lessons, and form more permanently engaging works." *Gent. Mag.*, vol. viii., New Series, pp 398 9 (Oct., 1837). Llallawg.

> The late Prebendary Davies.
>
> In our paper of Mar. 14 we briefly announced the death of this gentleman. In the Hereford Times of Mar. 17 there was the following somewhat extended notice : —
>
> We regret to announce the death of the Rev. James Davies, M.A., Prebendary of Hereford, at his residence, Moorcourt, near Kington, on Sunday last, in his 63rd year. Mr Davies was the second son of Mr Richard Banks of Kington, and was educated at Repton School and Lincoln College, Oxford, being a scholar on this foundation. He obtained a 3rd class "in Literis Humanioribus" in 1844, and subsequently proceeded to his B A. and M.A. degrees. He was ordained deacon in 1845 and priest in 1846 by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and held the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Forest of Dean, from 1847 to 1852. He was headmaster of King Edward's school, Ludiow, from 1852 to 1857 ; in the following year he succeeded his uncle at Moorcourt, when he assumed the surname of Davies by royal licence. He was a magistrate for the counties of Hereford and Radnor, and in 1875 he was appointed to the Prebendal Stall of Moreton et Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. He took an active interest in county and diocesan business ; amongst other things, the Church Building Society, diocesan inspection of schools, the Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, the Woolhope Club, and all local questions in and around Kington. For 21 years he regularly served a chapel of ease to the parish of Pembridge, erected by him at Moor Court. In a still wider circle he will be remem-bered in the literary world as the author of several classical works, and as a constant contributor to periodical literature, notably in the "Quarterly," "Contemporary," and "Saturday Reviews," "Blackwood’s Magazine," &c. In the neighbourhood of his home, where he was held in high esteem by all, the deceased gentleman’s death has occasioned deep sorrow ; and it is certain that a keen sense of grief will be felt throughout the large area in which he was so well known and so much respected.

> The papers contributed by the deceased gentleman to the periodicals named were largely topographical. Thus in the* Saturday Review* he published one on the Upper Wye, in 1872 ; on Montgomeryshire, in 1874 ; and on The Breiddeu Hills, in 1881. The last has an interesting history for some of our readers. Mr. Davies was on a visit to Mr. Morris Jones at Gungrog, and during the visit his host invited a small party to accompany his guest for a walk over the Breidden range ; an invitation we have never ceased to regret being unable to accept. The trip, as Mr. Davies put it in his subsequent paper, was "an endeavour at determining the locality of the last battle of the Silurian hero Caractacus, with his Roman Conqueror Ostorius;" and the paper was afterwards rewritten for the *Montgomeryshire Collections* of the Powys-Land Club.

> Mr. Davies was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, and a contributor to its journal. He wrote a very pleasant account, in the *Saturday Review*, of its excursion in 1874, under the title of "With the Cambrians at Wrexham"; and in 1881, he contributed a record of the Church Stretton meeting to *The Academy* , a record he afterwards amplified for the *Oswestry Advertizer*, from which paper it was transferred to the pages of the Shropshire Archaeological Society.

> A very interesting article from his pen was published in *Blackwood's Magazine* for Nov. 1875, on "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales," which was the subject — or rather a passage in it was— of a hot controversy in *The Academy*. In the course of his paper the writer (he preserved his incognito throughout) had mentioned the superstition of "The Sin-Eater," which attracted the attention of Professor Silvan Evans, who challenged the writer to produce proofs. Several letters were published, and other scribes joined in the discussion ; some account of which will, probably, shortly appear in the *Red Dragon*, issued by Daniel Owen and Co. of Cardiff.

> THE SIN EATER.
>
> There are two articles of belief connected with Wales and Welshmen that are firmly fixed in the minds of Englishmen all the world over. One of these is, that there is a village in Anglesey called LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwUtyssiliogogogoch, and the other that there used to be a disreputable old party connected with most parishes, whose business it was to swallow the offences of his defunct neighbours ; and who, accordingly, bore the ominous title of The Sin Eater. The latest reference I have seen to the village with the unpronouceable name is in the *South Australian Register* of Jan. 27th, of this year ; and the most recent "authority" for the superstition seems to be the Rev. Paxton Hood, who wrote a memoir of Christmas Evans a couple of years ago. But, first of all, let us see what the earliest known "authority" on the question has to say about it. John Aubrey, who flourished between 1626 and 1700, is the man to whom all later "historians" are indebted for their evidence of the prevalence of the custom. Poor old Aubrey has been dubbed by no less an authority than Giffard "a credulous fool," and, truly, as another writer observes, "his power of discriminating truth from falsehood was by no means remarkable."
>
> As the substance of what Aubrey says. Brand, in his *Popular Antiquities* quotes : "In the county of Hereford was an old oustome at Funeralls to hire Poor People, who were to take upon them the Sinnes of the Party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskel) I remember lived in a Cottage in Rosse high-waye. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the House, and layd on the Biere, a loafe of Bread was brought out and delivered to the Sinne Eater, over the Corps, as also a Mazar Bowle of Maple, full of beer (which hee was to drinke up), and Sixe-pence in money: in considera'con whereof he tooke upon him, *ipso facto*, all the Sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes, methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the olde Lawe." Aubrey goes on to say that though the custom was "rarely used in oure dayes, yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government." It was also observed at "Brecon, and heretofore all over Wales." He instances a case at "Glangors, where Mr Gwin, the Minister, about 1640, could not hinder the performance of this antient custome," and further remarks: "A.D. 1686. This custome is used to this daye in North Wales," where milk, he says, was the substitute for beer.
>
> Now this is positively all the evidence we have that such a custom ever prevailed in the Principality ; for although John Bagford (1717) tells (in Leland's Coll. I., lxxvi.) of "an old sire," who was furnished "with a Cricket, on which he sat ; a Groat, which he put in his pocket ; a Crust of Bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of ale, which he drank off at a draught," he does but copy Aubrey, upon whose text modern writers have founded homilies. Hone summarised most of the evidence in his *Year Book*. The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his *Health and Education* refers to the custom as an illustration of the performances of the Orphic priests, to show that in all ages we are very much alike ; and adds, "Alas, poor human nature !" Dr. Downes wrote most graphically of the custom in his *Mountain Decameron* —laying the scene between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth ; and others, "too numerous to mention," have given their versions of the practice, and specified the localities wherein it is observed ; but when these accounts are analysed, we invariably discern the "original sinner" to be the "long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Raskel" of the Ross highway.
>
> A very interesting discussion on this question took place in the *Academy* during the winter months of 1875-6, in consequence of an article in *Blackwood* on the "Legends and Folk-Lore of Wales," in which the writer referred to the horrible custom of sin-eating. This attracted the attention of the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, who wrote as follows : — "The earlier portion of my life was spent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Wales, but I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to, either as now existing or as having existed at some former period. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact with funerals ; but I have never found a trace of such a custom, and I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in the Principality." This at once called forth replies, but no new facts were obtained; all that was written being but a repetition of Aubrey and his followers. As may be supposed, the Blackwood writer was amongst the correspondents, and he called Professor Evans' attention to the fact that at the Ludlow meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society, in 1852, "Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this superstition as having occurred within five years at or near Llandebie, in the hill country of Carmarthenshire" and referred him to the *Journal* of the Society for the report. In the meanwhile Mr. Evans spared no pains to collect evidence, and took up "authorities," and gave the result of his enquiries in the Academy of Jan. 29, 1876. First of all he quotes a portion of what Mr. Moggridge was reported to have said ; which was this : — "In Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), only the plate and salt." It will be seen from the foregoing that no mention is made of "within five years ;" and on this fact Mr. Evans comments, but the matter was afterwards explained by the *Blackwood* writer in a further quotation from Mr. Moggridge, which, however, he and Mr. Evans read differently.
>
> In passing it will be interesting to note how old customs and legends get mixed up by modem historians ! Not a word is said by Aubrey about salt ; although the use of salt, in some form or other, at funerals, has not been disputed. But to return to Professor Evans's reply. In a private letter he received from Mr. Moggridge, that gentleman told him that he did "not remember anything that gives a date," adding that "the only written account" of the Sin Eater, "from personal knowledge, is that of Aubrey, ' de Gentilisme.'" And as Aubrey did not profess to speak from personal knowledge, Mr. Evans justly considered the matter as doubtful as ever. Llandebie itself was not unrepresented in the discussion. Mr. John Rowlands, the schoolmaster there, wrote to the following effect in the *Western Mail* : — "I opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, and I lived there for many years. I knew all the parishioners, and the history of the parish ; its legends, customs and traditions. And during the time I was there I attended many funerals, but never heard of a Sin Eater ; in fact people there never gave cakes at funerals. I knew almost every parish in South Wales. I collected all the legends, and made notes of the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillips. If such a custom had prevailed, I should have heard of it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring untruth." The Rev. Rees Evans, vicar of the parish, also wrote at some length, in reply to a letter from Mr. Silvan Evans. In the course of his communication he says : — "One intelligent old man, an octogenarian, whose ancestors had lived from time immemorial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in his opinion, could not have appeared here at least for the last two hundred years, or he would have heard of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a great age." The conclusion the clergyman comes to, after the enquiries he makes amongst his parishioners, is, that "the statements which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be substantiated by any reliable authority, or proved by any credible evidence."
>
> Mr. Evans's lengthy communication drew forth from the writer in *Blackwood* an equally lengthy reply ; in the course of which he referred to himself as, "by parentage, ancestry, property, and interests, connected with two counties of South Wales." And he speaks of his frequent travels over the whole of the Principality ; so he felt competent to offer an opinion, although he had failed to "acquire the language." Before this letter appeared, I had joined in the discussion, and hinted that the author of the paper on the "Legends and Folk Lore of Wales" was a resident of the Herefordshire border ; and I now have no hesitation in saying that it was the late Prebendary Davies, of Moor Court, Kington, whose recent death all who are interested in Welsh literature and archaeology have to mourn. His reply to Mr. Evans appeared on February 8th, and he quotes Murray's *Hand-book to South Wales* (edit. 1870), edited by "a medical man of eminence" (as he believes), for the fact that "the superstition of the Sin Eater is said to have lingered until very recently in the secluded valley of Cwm-Amman, in Caermarthenshire." After which he goes on to say:—"I refer to the ordnance maps, and find Cvvm-Amman to lie not far distant from Llandebie, on the Garnant branch of the Swansea Valley Railway. Lady Verney, in the current number of the *Contemporary* refers to the same superstition, and if the whole story does really trace back to Aubrey, it is at least singular that there should lie in wait for such enquirers as that pleasant antiquary, and his later fellow craftsman, Mr. Moggridge, deliberate fiction-mongers to practice on their credulity, and to spread abroad a lie which Welshmen feel it a point of national honour to repudiate. I scruple to take up your space, or I might show that such a superstition is not easily removed from others which, in many nations, have simulated the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat. Grotius on I Cor. iv., 13, traces one such in Caesar's account of the Gauls (B. ix., 6). That is coming near to the Welsh, though doubtless it would be treason to say that they are either ignorant or superstitious."
>
> In all this the *Blackwood* writer gives no further "authority;" — for the editor of the *Hand-book* could scarcely be accounted one — and Mr. Evans, in reply, observes that "Mr. Moggridge, and apparently the writer of the article, assume all along that the plate and salt are necessary remnants of the alleged Sin Eating practice ; and finding these articles employed in certain cases, they take it for granted that 'the more odious part of the custom has been removed,' which amounts to begging the whole question." He considers "it is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the part of the writer to 'refresh' his memory respecting 'the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical scape-goat;'" and concludes by refusing to give credit to any statement on the authority of "so credulous a person as Aubrey, in any case in which superstition plays a part." Here the discussion ended, as far as the principals were concerned. Another discussion was carried on in the "Shreds and Patches" column of the *Shrewsbury Journal* a year or two later ; and on more than one occasion the superstition has been referred to in the "Bye-gones" column of the *Oswestry Advertiser*. Mr. Wirt Sykes goes very fully into the question in his *British Goblins* and comes to the conclusion that "no other writer of Aubrey's time, either English or Welsh, appears to have made any reference to the Sin Eater in Wales; and equal silence prevails throughout the writings of previous centuries." And as to later "authorities," Mr. Sykes failed to discover one who wrote in the Welsh language, "a singular omission if there ever was such a custom, for concerning every other superstitious practice commonly ascribed to Wales, the Welsh have written freely."
>
> And now, when we might reasonably have expected that the Sin Eater had been laid for ever, appears the Rev. Paxton Hood's book — referred to in the March number of the Red Dragon. Mr. Hood is a very pleasant writer, but he is too impulsive for an antiquary. It was only in 1876 that he gave a glowing picture of Llanidloes, "the home of the really great poet, John Dyer," and told us of "Grongar Hill, a delicious spot in that neighbourhood !" Now he sets up an imaginary being in the district of Cwm-Amman ; and only varies the words of Mr. Murray's editor by remarking that the superstition "is said to linger even now," instead of (as Murray has it), "is said to have lingered until very recently," in that happy valley ! Mr. Hood's assertion was copied into *Notes and Queries* in January last, and will, doubtless, be accepted as gospel by a goodly number; but unfortunately for him, his book on Christmas Evans attracted the attention of a brother minister in the same Cwm-Amman Vale, who promptly wrote to the Christian World to repudiate the whole story.

> To the Editor of the Aberystwyth Observer.

> Sir.— I have been much interested by the letters which have appeared in your columns from the pen of the Rev. Silvan Evans on the subject of that suppositious personage, the "Sin Eater;" perhaps Mr. Evans or some other reader of antiquarian tastes may be able to inform me where I can find a reliable account of funny Twm, or as others prefer to style him "Thomas Jones, Esq., of Tregaron." I am aware that a "life" of Twm has been published at Llanidloes and by a London firm, but both those books have assumed the form of Welsh novels, and it is occasionally diiffcult to sever the real from the imaginary. If any of your readers can help me to solve my perplexity, or assist me to genuine facts I shall be heartily obliged. I am, sir, LLIDIARDE-Y-FFYNON.
