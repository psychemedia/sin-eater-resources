Notes and Comments

A commendable start was made yesterday with the preparations for the great regatta. The attendance at the public meeting was larger than had been imagined possible for the hour selected. Local yachting interests were largely represented, a fact made all the more agreeable by the ultimate result of the discussion.

We missed, however, the tradesmen who will derive the chief benefit from the regatta, They, at least, might have been expected to be eager that the most should be made of a great opportunity. Can it be that, inspired with implicit confidence in their townspeople into whose hands the control of the arrangements will fall, the trademen reserved themselves for the later effort to find the wherewithal? At all events, we hope to see them bulking large in the subscription list.

The preliminary skirmish for which we had been preparing the public for days came off with the best possible results, His Worship the Mayor facilitated agreement by casting overboard the preliminary meeting which had set so many teeth on edge. As usual, the press was made to serve as the sin-eater. It was gravely announced that an event widely reported --in every paper to substantially the same effect— had never taken place, and the public were invited to believe that wicked newspaper men had with one accord dreamt all the alleged facts.

It is undesirable to stir the paddle afresh, or a curious light-might be thrown on this incident. Our readers may, however, accept our assurance, given in all good faith, that the local press did not invent a single detail of that preliminary gathering, but each paper received the information independently from - but let the curtain descend, since somebody had to shoulder the blunder, and the press is accustomed to fill tho office of scape- goat.

One of the happiest circumstances attending the meeting was the brush over the title of the regatta. Grievances are better threshed out face to face than allowed to produce a silent fester none the less mischievous because unrecognised officially. The challenge of the title elicited a prompt and unmistakable demonstration in favour of retaining for Swansea that which had been won by Swansea. Mr. R. B. Lindley voiced the general feeling— its determination not to yield up to any section that which belonged to the whole community— its desire to rally to tho common cause every particle of influence capable of contributing to success. Mr. Griffith Thomas was quick to bring the matter to a head, and a practically unanimous vote dissipated all doubt regarding the view which prevailed.

Having nailed the Swansea colours to the mast the meeting proceeded to show how earnestly it sought to remove all reasonable cause of offence by the generosity of the treatment accorded the local yachtsmen who had been disposed to give a sinister interpretation to the change of title. There can be no two opinions respecting the generosity. It was so thorough that the members of the Bristol Channel Club cannot withhold their earnest support without loss of dignity and public respect. The whole incident ought now to be considered finally and happily closed and the long pull, the strong pull, and the pull all together should be a certainty.

Fault will doubtless be found with the committee selected, especially by those who did not attend to assist in making it less defective. of perfection are seldom practicable, and the committee in the exercise of its powers of addition may be trusted to repair the more obvious omissions. The main thing to remember is that the solitary rock which interfered with a clear course has been removed, and that the first-class yachts already promised ensure for Swansea the distinction and the practical benefit of the finest race ever seen in the Bristol Channel. We have now the ball at our feet, and unless singularly unfortunate or singularly incapable in our dealings with the owners of the yachts and the general public, weshould make the first of the great regattas of Swansea merely the fore-runner of many more in the years to come. All the natural advantages are here; it remains to be seen whether the necessary nous is also available to turn favouring cicumstances to account.

> THE SIN-EATER (Sept. 2, 1896).— The custom alluded to by Mr Seebohm is plainly connected with the worship of ancestors ; the cake was offered to them by males to the fourth degree of kindred. It does not seem possible to connect an *offering* at the hearth with the *meal* which is the central point of the sin-eater ritual. N.W.T.

N.W.T. is presumably N. W. Thomas?

> THE SIN-EATER (Sept. 2, 1896, May 12, 1897).— There is a long description of this old custom, as conducted in Devonshire, in S. Baring Gould's new novel, *Guavas the Tinner*. It is too long to transcribe into this column, but in that case a stranger was got hold of who had to eat a bit of saffron cake which lay on the dead man's breast and to drink from a bowl of spirits passed across the coffin. When he had done, all present raised a cry and threw at him sticks, cinders, and whatever they could lay hold of, and hustled him on all sides, and thrust him out of doors with the cry, "He has taken on him the sins o' the dead, Cast'm out." Will any of the readers of this column refer me to the literature of this subject? D.M.R.

> CHANCELLOR SILVAN EVANS.
>
> Some time ago a movement was set on foot to secure for the well-known Welsh lexicographer a pension from the Civil List. A petition bearing the names of the most representative and influential Welshmen, aided by the signatures of gentlemen eh belonged to other nationalities, was presented to Mr BALFOUR, and we are glad to state that the efforts made to duly recognise Chancellor EVANS' services to Welsh Literature have been crowned with success. It is with sincerest pleasure that we announce that a pension of £lOO is to be bestowed on Chancellor EVANS. The CHANCELLOR, now about 80 years of age, was born at a farm called Fronwilym, near Llanarth He is thus a Cardiganshire man, and we are proud of him as one of ourselves. It is very nit,,. worthy that threa of the most distinguished Welsh litterateurs of the present day hail from Ceredigion— Chancellor SILVAN EVANS, Principal RHYS, and Mr GWENOGFRYN EVANS. Chancellor EVANS has taken an interest in Welsh literature since his earliest boyhood. Being the youngest of a family of seven children, he was his mother's pet, and he had thus ample opportunities of hearing from her a vast amount of Welsh folk lore, of which she appears to have had an enormous fund. The old lady seems to have fired the boy's enthusiasm for things Welsh. When a very young man, he turned, as most young men with a literary bias turn, to poetry. and we have almost admired many of the compositions of the early period, and very particularly the translations from the English poets. The taste for Grammar, Welsh Archaeology, and Lexicography was developed at a very early age. In many of these earlier productions of his pen he is very fond of using archaic forms and phrase which are singularly delicious to our taste. Chancellor SILVAN EVANS is a standing proof that a lexicographer need not necessarily be a Dryasdus. It is hardly possible to meet a more witty and humorous companion. His supply of interesting folk lore tales is almost unbounded. These he has collected from various sources and at various times. No Welsh student should be without 'Ystên Sioned," which the CHANCELLOR collaborated with his old friend IFON, and which we must remind litterateurs was first printed at our office, and in the very conception of which we had a hand. We have often urged the CHANCELLOR to issue some other folk lore tales of a similar kind, for we are sure they would be most acceptable to the Welsh reading public of the present day. Chancellor EVANS for several years edited the " Archaeologia Cambrensis," to which he contributed a great number of articles on archaeolegy, hisory, language, folk lore, and cognate subjects. But the great work is undoubtedly the Welsh Dictioniry now issuing (though much too leisurely) through the press. This work, it is said, proved the most influential pleader of all in securing the Civil List pension. It is told that Mr BALFOUR lifted his hands in welcome and admiration when a copy of the great work was shown him. We have often referred to the work, but we cannot refrain from once more referring to this monument of Welsh scholarship. The more we look at it the more we are struck with the enormous reading that Chancellor Evans has brought to the task of its compilation. There is not a page but is rich in erudition, not a column but adds to the knowledge of the most well-informed and best-read. You can never peep into it without learning, something of the language of our couuntry and its history. Open the volumes at random, and you are at once face to face with a store of literary wealth which will repay studying and commnitting to memory. Take such a word as " Cyfoeth." First came its Cognates, as Cornish Covaith ; Irish, Cumact, &c; then its primary meaning, viz., a district, or region under one's rule or authority, territory, dominion. In attestation of this, there follows a series of references from the Mabinogion. Brut y Tywysogion, Buchedd Mair, Barddas, Iolo M.S.S., and WIlliam Salesbury's New Testament (Acts xxiii. 34), &c. In a sub-section there appears the phrase "Arglwydd y Cyfoeth," i.e., lord of the manor ; in a second sub-section comes a new meaning, viz., "Subjects." As a secondary meaning, we have "power, puissance, dominion, jurisdiction," as in such phrases as cyfoeth nef a daiar, powers of heaven and earth ; y Rhufeiniol gyfoeth, the Roman power; cyfoeth Duw, the power of God. All these meanings are well backed up by references to the ancient authorities. For third meaning we have weal, state, as for example y cyfoeth cyffredin, meaning the common or public weal. Fourthly, we arrive at the meaning riches, wealth, opulence, affluence, as in the phrases cyfoeth tiriog, landed property ; cyfoeth a golud, riches and wealth ; cyfoeth gogoniant, riches of glory. Those who live in our locality will now understand the meaning of the phrase by which one of our School Board districts is named — "Cyfoeth y Brenin." Look up, once more, the everyday word "dydd," and you will find five and a half columns of reading, which cannot possibly be dull to the most unintelligent. Years ago we used to see a great deal of Chancellor EVANS, and we have treasured many of the remarks on books and authors which be made in our hearing, and we have often thought that an article entitled "Silvaniana" would prove most interesting reading to all in whom the Welsh national sentiment is not defunct. We regret that our venerable friend has been for some time indisposed. We hope and trust however that the illness will soon pass away, and that he may be spared for many a year to prosecute the magnificent work to which he has devoted a long and assiduous lifetime.

> WAS THE SIBYL A CELTIC ORACLE.

>
> To the Editor of the "Western Mail."
>
> Sir,— Mr. J. S. Fraser, the great authority on folk-lore, has just brought out a new edition of Pausanius, in six volumes, including a most elaborate commentary. In the fifth volume, where Pausanius's remarks about the Sibyls come under review, the author of the "Golden Bough" adduces from German collections of modern folk-lore the following stories (as previously translated by Dr. M. R. James, and printed in the sixth volume of the "Classical Review"):-
>
> "Once upon a time there was a girl in London who wished to live for ever, go they say
>
> London, London is a fine town,
>
> A maiden prayed to live for ever.
>
> And still she lives ad hangs in a basket in a church, and every St. John's Day about noon she eats a roll of bread." Another tells of "a lady who resided at Danzig, and was so rich and so blest with all that life can give that she wished to live always. So when she came to her latter end she did not roally die, but only looked like dead, and very soon they found her in a hollow of a pillar in the church, half standing and half sitting, motionless. She stirred never a limb, but they saw quite plainly that she was alive, and she sits there down to this blessed day. Every New Year's Day the sacristan comes and puts a morsel of the holy bread in her mouth, and that is all she has to live on. Long, long has she rued her fatal wish who sets this transient life above the eternal joys of Heaven." A third story tells of a noble damsel who cherished the same foolish wish for immortality. So they put her in a baskot and hung her up in a church, and there she hangs and never dies, though many, many a year has come and gone since they put her there. But every year on a certain day they give her a roll, and she eats it and cries out "For ever' for ever! for ever!" And when she has so cried she falls silent again till the same time next year, and so it will go on for ever and for ever. The fourth anil last tale quoted by Mr. Frazer, which was taken down near Oldenburg in Holstein, te]s of "a jolly dame that ate and drank and lived right merrily and had all that heart could desire, and she wished to live always. For the first hundred years all went well, but after that she began to shrink and shrivel up, till at last she could neither walk nor stand nor eat nor drink. But die she could not. At first they fed her as if she were a little child, but when she grew smaller and smaller they put her in a glass bottle and hung her up in the church, and there she still hangs in the Church of St. Mary at Lubeck. She is as small as a mouse, but once a year she stirs."
>
> The way in which Mr. Frazer quotes these interesting German folk-tales is a capital instance of a weakness that the scientific folk-lorist is prone to- a weakness that I have already pointed out in my criticism of Mr. Sidney Hartland's treatment of the "Welsh Sin-eater." Mr. Frazer prints these tales in close connection with quotations of early references to oracular Sibyls in Roman and Greek authors of classical times. An unwary reader could not but connect them with the quotations from Petronius Arbiter, and the "exhortations to the Greeks attributed to Justin Martyr, and the inscriptions found in the lately discovered cave of the Erythraean Sibyl. Now, it so happened that just before Mr. Frazer's Pausanius came into my hands I had been reading a great deal about Christian symbolism. Among other material on that subject that was fresh in my memory was a little pamphlet by Mr. W. Marsh on the "Iconography of the Sibyls," where the author, omitting the treatment of the Sibyls by the great masters— Michael Angelo, Perugino, Raphael, and so on- describes how they are treated in Books of Hours, frescoes, and church windows. It is all but an absolute certainty that the German folk-tales quoted by Mr. Frazer have their source in the ecclesiastical art, and that any direct influence traceable to the old Sibyl oracles is in the highest degree improbable. Yet Mr. Frazer ignores entirely the Sibyl legends of Christian symbolism (I say legends, for many of the pictured representations include long-storied scrolls). His quotations, however, from earlier sources are more relevant to the illustration of his author, and one of them, the inscription from the Erythrean cave, is not, of course, in Alexandre's work on the Sibylline oracles, as that cave was only discovered in 1891. The short one has been restored to read thus:— "With good luck. The Erythraean Sibyl, daughter of a nymph and Theodorus." The longer inscription is given as follows:— "I am the oracular Sibyl, the minister of Phoebus, eldest daughter of a Naiad nymph. My native land is Erythrae, and no other, and Theodorus was my mortal sire. Cissotas was my birthplace, in which I uttered oracles to mankind as soon as I had issued from the womb. And, seated on this rock, I sang to mortal men prophecies of events which were yet to come. And every thrice three hundred years, as an unwedded maid, I travelled over all the earth; and here, again, beside this dear rock I now sit delighting in the kindly waters. And I rejoice that the time has now come to me in which I said that Erythrae would flourish again, and would enjoy all good government and wealth and virtue, when a new Erythrus should have come again to his dear native land." This inscription is referred to the second century A.D. -the time of the Antonines.
>
> But I must hurry on, and simply state here my opinion that the Sibyl of Cumae, in Campania. was, if not the earliest known to the Greeks, at any rate among the earliest. For I venture to suggest that the very name betrays her Western origin. The generally accepted derivation of that name, the Doric, sios-theos, and bolla-boule ("she that tells the will of God"), is all uncouth and far-fetched guess, indicating that the real meaning and origin were unknown to the Greeks. Now, to start with, the word looks like a genuine Latin diminutive, such as Tibullus, Catullus, and many others. Is there a Latin word with which it can be connected? There is. That word is sibus, which, with its compound per-sibus, is given by Festus as used by Plautus and Naevius in the sense of "acutus," "callidus". The feminine sibila might easily yield sibulla, and, in spite of the different quantity of the first syllable, it is not impossible that these words would be originally connected with sibilus- a "hissing" or "whistling." There is another very strong argument for the Western derivation of this oracle. Every schoolboy is familiar with the famous chaffering between Tarquin the Tyrant and the Cumaean Sibyl over the purchase of her fortune-telling book. In spite, however, of one's natural impression founded on that tale, the broad fact refnains that the oracles of the Cumaean Sibyl are chiefly distinguished from those of her numerous later sisters by some kind of defect in what I may call their literary promulgation. But to return to the derivation of the name: I do not know whether Sibus is a Latin word or not, but it has an undoubted cognate in Welsh.
>
> On p. 270 of Professor Rhys's "Celtic Heathendom" I find the following verses taken out of Skene's "Four Ancient Books of Wales":-
>
> "Seith seren yssyd,
>
> O seithnawn dofyd,
>
> Seon sywedyd
>
> A wyr eu defnyd.
>
> Seven stars are there,
>
> Of the seven gifts of the Lord;
>
> Seon the philosopher.
>
> He knows their nature."
>
> "Sywedyd" means philosopher, or man of science, and is obviously derived from "syw." At the present day my impression is that "syw" has the meaning of "smart" or "trim." On referring to Pughe's Dictionary it is quite clear that that eminent man had no real knowledge of the early meaning of the word. From the above-quoted old lines (probably) he supposed that "sywedyd" meant "astronomer"; and so he renders "Dewi mawr Mynyw swr sywedydd," "Great Dewi of Mynyw a constant observer of the stars," and comes to the conclusion that "syw" meant "steady or "constant." I do not know if "syw" is found spelt "siw" in old manuscripts, but it is extremely likely that "siu" or "siv" was the early form of the word, and in that case it would be the very same word as the Latin sibus, with the meaning of "he who knows." From "siw" we get "siwin" (? the Irish salmon of knowledge) and "siwen" "an epithet for the mermaid" (Pughe). Not only that, but the Welsh word for eel (llyswen) seems to be of similar derivation. Salesbury spells that word "llyssowen," which represents exactly the pronunciation known to me in my boyhood. It is not unlikely that the mysterious migrations and habits of sewin and eels may have had scmethiiig to do with the sibylline superstition. The important, position of salmon, and especially the salmon of knowledge in Irish folk-lore, is familiar to everybody; but even in Wales there are soma faint traces of similar beliefs. Professor Rhys draws attention (L.C.M., pp 555, 558) to the salmon of Llyn Llyw, connected by the ntory of Khulhwch with the Severn (Welsh Haf-ren; Lat. Sab-rina), and says that it "had more to say than the other ancients questioned by Arthur's men, because he had lived longer in the world". I may also quote the following from Theophilus Jones's "History of Brecknockshire":-
>
> "The sewin (a fish in high estimation in part of South Wales) is not found in many of the rivers of Breconshlra, except the Tawe. And here another observation occurs, though, perhaps, it has seldom, if ever, been attended to. The sewin is not seen in any river running in this country from east to west, but in all those flowing in a contrary direction. I leave this circumstance to the natural philosopher to account for; the fact it as I have stated" (I. p. 16). Whether it is a fact or not it cannot be dissociated from the "withershins," "tuathpel," or motion "against the sun" of folk-lore. That a marine origin may be almost certainly attributed to the sibyl also I gather from the Erythnean inscription given above. The "Exhortation to the Greeks" seems to imply the same thing, while the evidence of old coins tends in the same direction. A very early coin of Cumae at the British Museum has a female head on the observe, and a pistrix or "sea-serpent" on the reverse. Another (not in the British Museum) figured in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography under the article "Cumae," has on the reverse a female's head and upper part, with her hand on what looks like an eel, but it may be a sea-serpent! I have not seen similar figures on the old coinage of any other reputed seat of sibyls.
>
> I ought, perhaps, to mention that as Grote says (Greece III. p353) "There existed one solitary Grecian establishment in the Tyrrhenian Sea— the Campanian Cumae, near Cape Misenum, which the more common opinion of chronologists supposed to have been founded in 1050 B.C., and which has even been carried back by some authors to 1139 B.C. Without reposing any faith in this early chronology, we may, at least, feel certain that it is the most ancient Grecian establishment in any part of Italy."
>
> I have suggested above a Welsh origin for the word under discussion. In view, however, of the difficulty which Pughe seems to have encountered in dealing with "syw," the latter may, after all, lie another Irish survival in South Wales. In Irish, suadh— "cloak or gown of an Ollamh or professor: counsel, wisdom; also adj, discreet, wise"; and suaidh— "a wise man."— I am, &c., J. P. OWEN.
>
> P.S.—The last sentence reminds me that I have found an exact parallel from Scotland to my suggested derivation of Waunglyncath. A particular spot in Strathearn, a few miles from the famous Roman camp at Ardoch (see "Penny Cyclopedia," S. V.), is called Strageth, "the valley of the fort." There are still to be seen there the remains of an old Roman station. A careful examination by a competent military engineer of the country from the present Waunglyncath and Cathilas, its far as the Turcan (that is the local pronunciation, not Turcarn), would not improbably result in some interesting diseoveries.

> The Sin Eater of Wales.
>
> THE principality of Wales has within living memory possessed an official known as the "Sin Eater." It was the practice of a relative — usually a woman — to put on the breast of a deceased person a quantity of bread and cheese and beer, and the "Sin Eater" was sent for to consume them and to pronounce the everlasting rest of the departed. It was believed that in doing this he absolutely ate and appropriated to himself the sins symbolized by the viands, and thereby prevented their disturbing the repose of the sinner who had committed them. Such an arrangement would obviously leave nothing to be desired on the one side, but how it worked on the other we are not told. What was supposed to be the condition of this spiritual undertaker after the ceremony was concluded? Did his "appropriation" of the dead man's sins imply a sort of moral assimilation of them, answering to his physical assimilation of the bread and cheese? The question would obviously be one of some importance to a sin eater in large practice. If the responsibilities of his profession were as great as they would appear to have been on this hypothesis, he would need to retire from it early, and to devote a considerable portion of his closing years to repentance and good works. Again, it is natural to ask what happened at the decease of a popular or " ashionable" sin eater? Would anyone among his professional brethren undertake to eat his sins, even in the first flush of satisfaction produced by stepping into his shoes? If so, then, indeed, has the epithet of "gallant" been rightly bestowed upon little Wales. It is as though one doctor succeeding to another's practice should consent to assume the moral responsibility for his colleagues treatment of all his deceased patients, in addition to his own similar burdens. We yield to none in admiration of the quiet and homely heroism of the medical profession, but we doubt whether it would enable them to face such an ordeal as this. As to the Welsh practitioners to whom we have compared them, we shrink from pursuing the analysis further. It is evident that, as ,in the school boy game of "conquerors," where a stone which can smash the smasher of, say, fortythree other stones, takes all his conquests and becomes itself a "fortytourer," so the responsibilities of these unhappy men might accumulate at an alarming rate. One hardly dares to contemplate the internal condition of the sin eater of a sin eater who had in life attended a long series of other sin eaters. The cheese would be almost converted into Welsh rabbit before he had got it down.
