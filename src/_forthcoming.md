# Forthcoming

With the second controversy well underway, and out brief interlude, complete,we will noew resume the debate, although no longer in the pages of *The Times*. Instead we wil return to the home of the first debate, and the pages of *The Academy*.

The final part will see how the tradition – or legend? – of the sin-eater has been remembered, and perhaps further elaborated on, since then.

And there will also be an appenddix: on the Welsh tradition, or not?!, of "bundling".
