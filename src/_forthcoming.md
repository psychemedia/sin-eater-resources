# Forthcoming

The first controversy now discussed, the next chapters will review the intervening period between the first and second controversies.

The fourth part will introduce the trigger for the second correspondence debate, the meeting of the British Association, and the resulting debate.

The final part will see how the tradition – or legend? – of the sin-eater has been remembered, and perhaps further elaborated on, since then.

And there will also be an appenddix: on the Weslh tradition, or not?!, of "bundling".
