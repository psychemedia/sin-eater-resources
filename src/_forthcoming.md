The first controversy now discussed, there are just a few loose ends and minor skirmishes to tidy up, before going on to the third part which will review the intervening period between the first and second controversies.

The final part will see how the tradition – or legend? – of the sin-eater has been remembered, and perhaps further elaborated on, since then.
