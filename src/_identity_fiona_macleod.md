# An Aside — The Mysterious Miss Macleod

Of the various digitised copies of *The Sin-eater and Other Tales* that are available on `archive.org`, the author is intriguingly given as *William Sharp* in [at least one version](https://archive.org/details/sineaterandothe00shagoog/page/n304/mode/2up).

The reference to William Sharpe seemed really odd to me; a search of archive.org turns up Fiona Macleod's "The Sin-Eater and Other Tales", a tale of a Scottish sin-eater, with a William Sharp (not Sharpe) identied as the author [example](https://archive.org/details/sineaterandothe00shagoog/page/n304/mode/2up?q=sharp), but it seems as if that has been mistakenly extracted from elsewhere in the book?  But then it turns out the Fiona Macleod is a pseudonym of William Sharp... eg https://albion.org.uk/historical-albion/william-sharp-fiona-macleod-1855-1905/ ]`


So who why does this unusual attribution appear? Therein lies a literary mystery. For throughout her publishing career, Fiona Macleod had remained elusive. Despite being an active correspondent, she never appeared in public, and contact with her was through a forwarding address.

Whether deliberate or not, the publication of Macleod's first novel, *Pharais*, caused one reviewer to raise the possibility that Fiona Macleod was a psudonym

"PHARAIS." Mr. Grant Allen writes :— "Have you seen 'Pharais,' by Fiona Macleod? —whether a real name or a pseudonym I know not. It is a charming little volume, published by Frank Murray, at Derby; and it strikes me as one of the daintiest outcomes of the Celtic revival. The story is an idyll of the Western Isles, vague, dreamy, mysterious, yet throbbing with human interest. It touches at times on some real problems of latter-day thinking. It is Ossianic, of course, instinct with the spirit of the Celtic twilight, and seems to come to us straight from the Isles of the Dead that lie beyond Britain. But the sense of colour is delicious, and the touch as light and delicate as a beautiful woman's hand. The book, with its glimpses of misty straits and floating islets, reminds one exactly of the outlook from some far western headland over the summer-blue belted sea, as one has seen it often on the Argyllshire coast in the uncertain haze of a basking August. I will not attempt to tell the theme of the tale, lest a rough masculine hand should spoil its daintiness. I will only say, on the other hand, that 'Fiona Macleod' falls into the common Celtic fault of giving us a little too much of the Celtic nature-poetry. She must remember that the Celt has always his besetting sin of excessive sweetness to contend with; and that perfection in literature can only be attained by avoiding excess, even in the direction of ones own best qualities. Moreover, she should aim at an audience which loves not Celticism. Success still lies in the lap of the Saxon. I do not often review a book nowadays, but this little volume, dropped upon me from the clouds, has impressed me so much that I venture to call the attention of others to it. Only they must remember it is a work of fancy, not a circulating library novel, and must not expect to find it 'thrillingly interesting,' *à la* Fergus Hume or *à la* Rider Haggard."

The "Ossianic" reference might also be teasing us to recall the ... ossian controversry etc

"PHARAIS."

TO THE EDITOR Of THE WESTMINIER GAZETTE.

SIR, —My attention has been drawn to a suggestion in one or two evening papers of recent date that the author of the Celtic romance "Pharais"— a generous note about which from Mr. Grant Allen appeared in THE WESTMINSTER lately— is Mr. William Sharp. It is true that my fricntl and kinsman, Mr. William Sharp, saw "Pharais" "through the press" for me, and here, no doubt, is the origin of the misapprehension; but as to its authorship, will you courteously allow me to state that I, and I alone, am the writer of the book in question? I am, Sir, yours very truly, 3, East Savile-road, Newington, Edinburgh. FIONA MACLEOD.

Fiona Macleod, the author of "The Mountain Lovers," is a genuine name and not a pseudonym, as has been conjectured in some quarters. Fiona is the diminutive of Fionnaghal, the Gaelic equivalent of Flora. Miss Macleod is a native of the South Hebrides, where she passed her early years. She still spends part of the year in the Highlands of her native place and of Argyllshire, where the scenes of "The Mountain Lovers" are laid, and for the rest of the time she lives near Edinburgh. She is still quite young.

https://albion.org.uk/historical-albion/william-sharp-fiona-macleod-1855-1905/
William Sharp / Fiona Macleod 1855 – 1905

William Sharp / Fiona Macleod
William Sharp was truly a Victorian man of mystery. He was a forerunner and pioneer of the present time in so many ways — poet, novelist, biographer and friend of many prominent Victorian pioneers such as W.B.Yeats, Dante Gabriel Rosetti and John Arthur Goodchild. He also was impelled to invent for himself a completely 'other' secret life with a second identity as Fiona (a name he invented!) Macleod who wrote about her life in the Scottish Isles tapping into the ancient Celtic oral traditions with their stories of fairies, spirits and nature beings from what she called 'the green world.' Writing to Goodchild in the dedicatory introduction to 'The Winged Destiny' she wrote of Iona, 'Do you, too, not hold Iona, motherland of all my dreams, as something rare and apart, one who has her own  lovely solitude and her own solitary loveliness that is like no other loveliness? In your heart, as in mine, it lies an island of revelation and peace.' These writings became so popular at the time that she was listed in the social directory of 'Who's Who' from 1899-1905. Yet few guessed at the identity of Fiona Macleod, an identity that even his wife, Elizabeth, kept hidden as did his 'secret lover' Edith Wingate Rider.
From 1893-1905 Sharp wrote as Fiona Macleod and revealed a treasury of ancient Faery Lore dealing with both Christian and pre-Christian beliefs, revealing unknown aspects of the life of St.Columba and several beautiful stories of the Christ child. Sharp, as Macleod, found it easy to step between the worlds and write enchanting prose, poetry and plays about the ancient Celtic world, revealing the lost traces of the old Gaelic traditions for the first time in the English language.

The letters are interesting because of the wide range of people Sharp corresponded with and the topics he addressed. He was a close friend with many of the most important literary people of his age, among them Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Walter Pater, George Meredith, Thomas Hardy, and William Butler Yeats. He also corresponded with firms who published his books and with editors of magazines, journals, and newspapers for which he wrote articles and reviews. The letters will be of interest to individuals interested in literary and publishing activities in Great Britain and the United States in the 1880s and 1890s.

In 1894, William Sharp decided to publish a romance set in the western isles of Scotland under a female pseudonym, Fiona Macleod. He soon realized he would need to engage in correspondence from its supposed author in order to publish more works by Fiona Macleod while keeping his authorship secret. He enlisted his maiden sister, Mary Sharp, who lived with their mother in Edinburgh, to provide the Fiona Macleod handwriting. Sharp composed the letters and sent them to her to copy and mail from Edinburgh. Until his death in 1905, Sharp engaged in a double out-put of correspondence. This section includes letters Sharp wrote under both names.

The mechanism he devised to produce the Fiona Macleod letters contributed significantly to his ability to preserve for more than a decade the fiction that Fiona Macleod was a real woman. Claims that he was the real author emerged in print occasionally and were countered by pointing to the different handwriting. The letters were mailed always from one place while Sharp was constantly on the move. Sharp also moved Fiona Macleod about from place to place in order to preserve the secret, and it was convenient for her to send her letters to a friend in Edinburgh for posting.

The letters also gave Sharp the opportunity to create the person or, more accurately, the persona of Fiona Macleod. With great literary skill, he defined and entered the consciousness of a character and had that character project herself convincingly to her correspondents. She came through the letters as a  well-educated young woman steeped in Celtic lore. She was shy and reclusive, but also firm in her decisions, formal in manner, and resolved not to let herself be taken advantage of by publishers or diverted from her writing by newspaper reporters or suitors. She was also well-travelled, able to disappear on a yachting trip at a moments notice, because she had the good fortune to be married to a wealthy Scotsman who owned a yacht that could whisk her away to the western isles. She also had a sharp tongue which she exercised in correspondence when she thought her privacy or integrity endangered. She was particularly harsh in chastising anyone brash enough to suggest she had no existence except in the mind of William Sharp.

Fiona Macleod was William Sharp's most impressive literary achievement. Her personality emerges in many stories that describe the people she met and the places she visited and in dedications and prefatory notes in her books. Yet it is in the letters that Sharp brought her into being. His ability to sustain the fiction that Fiona Macleod was a real human being was due, primarily, to his ability to project her in the letters as a woman who interacted easily with the people she wrote about and who genuinely cared about them and about the people she addressed in her letters. 

The Fiona Macleod letters are best approached as a body of literature which Sharp composed as a matter of necessity and because he enjoyed the process of creative deception. Cast in this light, the letters and the character who emerges through them constitute one of the most interesting and provocative literary productions of the 1890s in England.

Who is "Fiona Macleod"? This is the question some readers are asking, a good deal of mystery having surrounded the identity of this lady since her writings first attracted notice. "Fiona Macleod" was thought to be a *nom de plume*, but when it was discovered that the name was a real one, the lady was said to be a daughter of the late Norman Macleod. This was ascertained to be incorrect, and then it was stated that she was a cousin of Mr. William Sharp's wife. This, and the fact that no one had seen the mysterious protége of Professor "Pat" Geddes, led to the theory that tho responsibility for "Pharais," "The Sin Eater," &c., lay with either Mr. or Mrs. Sharp. But this again has been denied by Professor Geddes, who declares that Fiona Macleod is— Fiona Macleod. And there the mystery remains. The other Celtic writer, Mr. Neil Munro, author of "The Lost Pibroch." is on the staff of the Glasgow *Evening News*.

MYSTERY! MYSTERY !

ALL IN A CELTIC HAZE.

"Mac" writes :— Highland Celts in Glasgow are, I hear, hot on the scent of what they imagine to be a female James Macpherson. This, of coarse, is Miss Fiona Macleod. The way which Miss Macleod has led our Glasgow countrymen is strange indeed, and the literary detective has been busy. In the first place, it is asserted that Miss Fiona Macleod does not exist. No one seems to have seen her. One gentleman called twice at her residence in Edinburgh, and Miss Macleod was out. She has written about Iona, but again in that well watched place her name is unknown. The natural inference, you will admit, is that there is something here to he "fahnd aht," as the Englishman says. Seeing that the non-existence of Miss Fiona Macleod has been thus established, the next point is who wrote those books to which that name is attached. Now. Mr William Sharp has declared himself to be Miss Fiona Macleod's uncle; he has, too, interested himself in Celtic things. Isn't it the second natural inference that he has written the books? But Mr Sharp has specifically denied the authorship. Then, of course, it must be Mr and Mrs Sharp in collaboration. But again comes denial. Mr Sharp has addressed the following note to the "Evening News," which has been somewhat persistent in casting on the existence of Miss Macleod:—"Miss Fiona Macleod is not Mr William Sharp. Miss Fiona Machnid is not Mrs William Sharp. Miss Fiona Macleod is—Miss Fiona Macleod." Personally I am disposed to believe Mr Sharp. He has attained to a place in the world of letters which is not to be trifled with, and he has done nothing to forfeit our confidence in his truthfulness. I cannot exactly see why, if he were the author of "Pharais", "The Mountain Lovers," and Miss Fiona Macleod's other books he should be disposed to deny it. Such denial would mean no gain but much loss to him when the inevitable discovery should come. But then an examination of "Miss Fiona Macleod's" works should, I think, satisfy most folk. They are undoubtedly those of a woman—that, I am safe in saying, anyone with a knowledge of literature cannot deny. Then I think for anyone who cares to take the trouble there is sufficient evidence in the books to show that they could scarcely be the work of Mrs Sharp. They are, to my mind, those of a younger woman who has been inflenced in some degree by the recent uprising of feminine fictionists. Of course, you may ask. But who is "Miss Fiona Macleod?" The question is natural, maybe, but is it any of your business? If this ??? to steer clear of the personal [photographist?] if she desires no photographic notoriety, no interviewer's questions— is she to be blamed for it?  There is no sin in it— literary or otherwise— that I can see. A curious, and I think a very ridiculous, satement is made about some of the work. It has been said that portions of it appeared long ago in America under Mr William Sharp's name. But the most astonishing assertion of all is that then they were Irish stories. I wonder is this some of the quiet fun with which, according to W. S. Gilbert, the world teems. The disbelief in Miss Macleod's personality is deepened in some minds by the fact that her work is full of Irishisms and contains much inaccurate Gaelic. I saw the other day a marked copy "The Washer of the Ford," and I must confess that the number of mistakes in Gaelic and in small points relating to manners, customs, and beliefs was somewhat startling. But are these mistakes, unfortunately too common, to blind us to the genius of this woman? I hear again and again that she is a greater fraud than Macpherson of Ossianic fame: that she is less true to outward nature than Macpherson. That may be: but what about truth to the spirit of things? Are we to deny that this woman, who writes so beautifully of what seems to her the characteristics of the Celtic mind—are we to deny her a place amongst Celtic writers? But I am forgetting: I set out to gossip about a mysterious personality, not to write a defence of Miss Macleod. Some day when the opposition to her becomes articulate I may bring forth the evidence I have been collecting to show that whatever may be her faults, the Celtic mind is in a great measure mirrored in her works. Altogether we seem to be oa the eve of a rather peculiar controversy.

NOTES

FIONA MACLEOD. PAGE 255
Miss Macleod is one of the younger writers most intimately associated with the Celtic Renascence in Scotland. "The Prayer of Women" (see page 255) is from Pharais: a *Romance of the Isles* (Frank Murray, Derby, 1894); "The Rune of Age" and "A Gaelic Milking Song" are from *The Mountain Lovers* (John Lane); the "Lullaby" and the two songs of Ethlenn Stuart are from her last volume, *The Sin-Eater: and other Tales* (Patrick Geddes and Colleagues, Edinburgh). "The Closing Doors" has not been published hitherto. The brief lyric, "The Sorrow of Delight," was contributed to an as yet unpublished fantastic sketch, *The Merchant of Dreams*, written in collaboration with a friend. Such of the poems scattered through her several volumes, and others, as she wishes to preserve in connected form, will be published by Miss Macleod early in 1896 (Patrick Geddes and Colleagues), under the title of *Lyric Runes and Fonnsheen*.

FIONA MACLEOD,

The reissue of the shorter stories of Fiona Macleod has once more drawn the attention of the reading public to an interesting personality. In these days it is not easy to conceal the identity of a writer; but the author of *The Sin Eater* has succeeded to a remarkable degree in shrouding herself in the dim mystery of the wild Celtic nature. She prohibits any reproduction of her photograph; she declines any interview the object of which is to obtain personal details; and those who know her personally feel bound to observe her wishes with respect to the non-obtrusion of the details of her private life. This reticence has naturally led to a number of somewhat wild guesses at her identity. It has been stated at various times that Fiona MacLeod is Mr. or Mrs. William Sharp, Mr. W. B. Yeats, and Miss Maud Hopper in conjunction, and one of the latest *canards* is to the effect that there is no such person as Fiona Macleod at all, but simply a syndicate of young Celtic authors who write under that name. In course of time all these conjectures will be found to be without any foundation, for, although Fiona MacLeod publicity of all kinds, she is by no means a hermit, and is already well known personally to several men and women of letters. It does not seem to have occurred to the paragraphists that Fiona Macleod wee be a young married woman writing under her maiden name.

Miss Macleod is by birth and conviction a Celt of the Celts. She is a member of an old Highland family, and, contrary to general belief, the name is no pseudonym, but a genuine one, Fiona being the diminutive of Fonaghal, the Gaelic of Flora.

Miss Macleod spent most of her childhood in the Outer and Inner Hebrides and the Western Highlands, particularly in the islands of Iona and Arran, She is passionately fond of Iona, which represents to her the birthplace of her imaginative life. Eight years ago, on account of delicate health, she spent some time in Italy, on the Riviera, and in Southern France. She knows Brittany well, and resided for a considerable period in Paris. Sometimes a faint echo from the most modern of cities seems to find its way into one of her Barbaric Tales, and the effect of this strange blending of the old with the new is fantastic in the extreme. Before she went abroad for the first time Miss Macleod lost her father—her mother died when she was still a child—but fortunately she was not left dependent on her pen, which, indeed, at that time she had not begun to use. But Miss Macleod is essentially a child of nature and the open air, having no sympathy with the hurried life of the great cities, which she seldom visits. Her chief pleasure consists in cruising among the isles in a small yacht or even half-decked wherry, in going out with the herring-fishers, and in visiting the remote "bothies" of the shepherds high up on the bleak and lonely mountains.

Miss Macleod's first literary experiment was a short story which she sent, in the autumn of 1893, to the *National Observer* (at that time *The Scots' Observer*). This story, "The Last Fantasy of James Achanna," was declined by Mr. Henley, who, however, wrote to the author a word of genuine encouragement. This story has never been republished. Miss Fiona Macleod's first book, *Pharais*, which, by the way, is a slightly Anglicised spelling of the genitive of the Gaelic word for Paradise, was begun in the summer of 1893 and finished before the close of that year. *Pharais* is one of the most personal of all Miss Macleod's writings. It is generally understood that the island of Irmisron which is depicted in this romance is the remote island where the author spent many summers of her early childhood, and there are certain incidental autobiographical touches in the portraiture and environment of the heroine, Lora. *Pharais* was published through Mr. Frank Murray, of Derby, simultaneously with the volume of dramatic studies entitled *Vistas* by the author's relative, Mr. William Sharp, who was her intermediary in the publication of this volume, and also of *The Mountain Lovers*, which was issued by Mr. John Lane in the spring of 1895. It was doubtless through this connexion that the rumour first got abroad that Fiona Macleod was either Mr. or Mrs. Sharp. For some time after the publication of her first two romances Miss Macleod worked at a volume which has since been published under the title of *Green Fire*, and which was projected' about the same time as *Pharais*. She, however, felt convinced that her subjects were most suited to the short story, and in the intervals of work at the longer romances she had written a numberof short tales which were published under the titles *The Sin Eater and Other Tales*; and *The Washer and Other Legendary Moralities*. Miss Macleod's, reputation rests largely on these two collections, which have now been reissued in three distinct groups with several additions. The *Sin Eater* was published in the autumn of 1895 by a new firm, Messrs. Patrick Geddes & Colleagues, who have shown themselves eager in every way to identify themselves with the work of Miss Macleod, and have issued her books in a particularly, appropriate and artistic *format*. Last autumn, Miss Macleod published her earlier romance, *Green Fires*, through Messrs. Constable & Co. The many critics who have warned the author of this book against an over-elaborateness and artificiality will be glad to hear that it is the work she likes least. Miss Macleod is now concentrating all her energies on an historical romance, and she has consequently put aside a number of short stories and one or two longer books. It is not likely, therefore, that much from her pen will see the light before this romance is completed. The only book by her that may positively appear this year is a story for children, which Messrs. Constable & Co. wish to issue at Christmas. The publication of a short romance, *The Lily Leven*, which has been again and again announced, is indefinitely postponed, though the story is practically finished. In this book it will be found that Miss Macleod has worked from a new standpoint, and has dwelt on the humour, gaiety, and grotesque contrasts of Celtic life.

In spite of the success that has attended the publication of her poems, "From the Hill of Dreams," which is by far the most personal and intimate book Miss Macleod has given to the world, she has determined to publish no more verses.

I take the following paragraphs from the "Academy." By a certain class I know that all this will be disbelieved. Nothing that can be said of Miss Macleod can be believed, even though those who speak and write are people hitherto considered honourable. To this class of unbelievers it is without the bounds of possibility that any one should not seek notoriety.

A great deal of mystery has always hung round the identity of the writer known as Fiona Macleod. The Academy brushes it aside, and announces once more that Fiona Macleod is no pseudonym, but is the maiden name of the young married woman who wrote "The Sin Eater." Most of her childhood was passed in the Outer and Inner Hebrides and the Western Highlands. Eight years ago, on account of delicate health, she spent some time in Italy, on the Riviera, and in Southern France. Miss Macleod has no sympathy with the hurried life of the great cities, which she seldom visits.

BY THE WAY

...

Who is Fiona Macleod? The critics are much exercised over the question. and few of them appear to have succeeded in raising the veil of *incognito* behind which the authoress prefers to stay. One authority in *canards* suggests that there is no such person as Fiona Macleod in existence, and that a syndicate of young Celtic authors are endeavouring, under that name, to found a new literary school. The *Academy*, however, seems to have had a peep behind the scenes. Fiona Macleod is, we are told, a young married woman, who simply makes use of her maiden name for publishing purposes. She is by birth and connection a Celt of the Celts, a member of an old Highland family, and passed most of her childhood in the Outer and Inner Hebrides, especially in the islands of Iona and Arran. Miss Macleod is essentially a child of nature and the open air, having no sympathy with the hurried life of the greet cities, which she seldom visits. Her chief pleasure consists in cruising among the isles in a small yacht or even half-decked wherry, in going out with the herring fishers, and in visiting the remote "bothies" of the shepherds high up on the bleak and lonely mountains. She is personally known to a number of literary people, but refuses to be interviewed, or to have her portrait published, or, in short, to be known to the general public. And her wishes are being respected.

WHO IS FIONA MACLEOD?
TWO collections of short stories entitled "The Sin Eater and Other Tales," and "The Washer and Other Legendary Moralities," have been within the last two or three years attracting marked attention from the critics, especially those of England. The author's name was given as Fiona Macleod, and her tales are wild, mystical Celtic romances of quite remarkable power. The presumption was that "Fiona Macleod" was a pseudonym, and many guesses have been made at the identity of the author. Mr. William Sharp, Mrs. William Sharp, W. B. Yeats, and Miss Hopper were in turn singled out as the writer of the tales, and finally, each guess proving a miss, it was conjectured that a syndicate of young Celtic authors were writing under this pseudonym.

The London *Academy* now informs the world that Fiona Macleod is simply Miss Fiona Macleod, that being the real name of the author, who declines all interviews the object of which is to obtain personal details of her private life, and prohibits the reproduction of her photograph. *The Academy* proceeds to give us the following additional information:

"Miss Macleod is by birth and conviction a Celt of the Celts. She is a member of an old Highland family, and, contrary to general belief, the name is no pseudonym, but a genuine one, Fiona being the diminutive of Fionaghal, the Gaelic of Flora.

"Miss Macleod spent most of her childhood in the Outer and Inner Hebrides and the Western Highlands, particularly in the islands of Iona and Arran. She is passionately fond of Iona, which represents to her the birthplace of her imaginative life. Eight years ago, on account of delicate health, she spent some time in Italy, on the Riviera, and in Southern France. She knows Brittany well, and resided for a considerable period in Paris. Sometimes a faint echo from the most modern of cities seems to find its way into one of her Barbaric Tales, and the effect of this strange blending of the old with the new is fantastic in the extreme. Before she went abroad for the first time Miss Macleod lost her father—her mother died when she was still a child—but fortunately she was not left dependent on her pen, which, indeed, at that time she had not begun touse. But Miss Macleod is essentially a child of nature and the open air, having no sympathy with the hurried life of the great cities, which she seldom visits. Her chief pleasure consists in cruising among the isles in a small yacht or even half-decked wherry, in going out with the herring-fishers, and in visiting the remote 'bothies' of the shepherds high up on the bleak and lonely mountains.

"Miss Macleod's first literary experiment was a short story which she sent, in the autumn of 1893, to The National Observer (at that time The Scots' Observer). This story, 'The Last Fantasy of James Achanna,' was declined by Mr. Henley, who, however, wrote to the author a word of genuine encouragement. This story has never been republished. Miss Fiona Macleod's first book, 'Pharais,' which, by the way, is a slightly Anglicized spelling of the genitive of the Gaelic word for Paradise, was begun in the summer of 1893 and finished before the close of that year. 'Pharais' is one of the most personal of all Miss Macleod's writings. It is generally understood that the island of Irmisron which is depicted in this romance is the remote island where the author spent many summers of her early childhood, and there are certain incidental autobiographical touches in the portraiture and environment of the heroine, Lora."

Other of her works are "Vistas" (a volume of dramatic studies), "The Mountain Lovers," "Green Fire," and the two volumes already mentioned, "The Sin Eater," and "The Washer," on which Miss Macleod's reputation chiefly rests. A short romance, "The Lily Seven," has been repeatedly announced, but has now been indefinitely postponed. She is at present engaged on an historical romance, and the only book likely to appear from her pen this year is a story for children.

OUR LONDON LETTER

...

Literary people do not seem to be happy until they discovered the identity of writers who, for reasons best known to themselves, issue their works under a pseudonym. Miss Robins, the author of "The Open Question," complained bitterly the other day that the authorship of the bock had not been allowed to remain veiled under penname of "C. E. Raimond." Now a determined effort is being made to rnn to earth Miss "Fiona Macleod," who thus far has baffled her pursuers. For some years this lady has been before the public, but no one has yet torn aside the pseudonymity in which she chooses to cloak herself. ...

Personal Literature &c.

Great efforts have been made to maintain the secret of the personality of Miss Fiona Macleod. Miss Macleod's letters have to be re-addressed three or four times before they come into her hands. She is known to a small circle who keep the secret well. No editor has managed to get her photograph, though one had it in his hands. We doubt, says the "Academy," if Miss Macleod's publishers have met her. Certain Gaels, whose dislike for Miss Macleod's work amounts to passion, have sought assiduously to force her to reveal her personality. Every sort of criticism except that which is literary has been applied to her work. One ardent Gael turned up the files of a Glasgow paper to see if any of the tragedies Miss Macleod depicts actually occurred, another took a census of Iona — no difficult task — to discover the originals of her characters. It is startling to learn that their researches were unavailing. Still another Gael is said to have done detective duty opposite a house in Edinburgh where Mira Macleod sometimes days, and Miss Macleod is as unknown as ever.

WHO IS FIONA MACLEOD?

A STUDY IN TWO STYLES.

Under the above title a correspondent of the "Daily Chronicle" of Saturday last published a long article tending to show the identity of this distinguished writer with Mr. William Sharp, the well-known critic. The "Chronicle" writer says: —The closer becomes one's acquaintanceship with Fiona Maclood's books, the stronger grows the conviction that a woman is not the writer. The standpoint from which life regarded, certain frank and unfeminine modes of expression, the love and the relations of the sexes, cannot be associated with woman. Does not even the dedication "To Esclarmoundo," prefixed to "The Silence of Amor," suggest the masculine note? There is not, indeed, a foreword, whether to George Meredith, Kathia, E. W. R., that one is able mark as the work a womam.

Surely, too, Pharais cannot be received as a first venture. That its author had attained something like middle-age we infer from such expressions — connected in the introductory letter with personal experiences — as "a long while ago," and "many years ago." And if Fiona Maclcod is a woman, would not Mrs. Sharp have included some lines from such a writer in her anthology "Women's Voices"? But the book contains no reference to Miss Macleod, though, admittedly, Mrs. Sharp is well acquainted with her. That Miss Macleod should have been "some mute, inglorious singer" until the appearance of "Pharais" seems beyond belief. And Mr. Sharp's references to Fiona Macleod are noticeably and unusually bald. In his notes to "Lyra Celtica," for instance, while almost every other writer who figures there is praised, some with words of warmest eulogy, Miss Macleod simply referred to as "one of the younger writers most intimatelv associated with the Celtic Renaissance in Scotland." And this, notwithstanding the fact that she is more largely represented in the collection than any other poet.

I exceedingly regret not having hand copies of the four parts of "The Evergreen", to which William Sharp and Fiona Macleod were contributors, but, apart from these, there is quite sufficient under both signatures for the purpose of comparison. The peculiarities in the vocabulary and style of one strikingly resemble those of the other, and cannot overlooked. Both have a special use for such words as "myriad", "aerial," "poignant," "cosmic," "honey-ooze," "suspire, "sunswept," and many more that could be readily mentioned. On the one hand we have "unfrontiered land," and the other "disfrontiered realm." From one "scytheswift," and from the other "scythesweep." Miss Macleod has "the suspiration of the sea," and Mr. Sharp "ocean, a breath, a suspiration." Both are fond of "the spiers of the heather" and "whirling stars"; and both are addicted to an ever-recurring and peculiar employment of the word "green." In Mr. Sharp's "Ecce Puella" we have "the wine-dark purple of the bell-heather and the paler amethyst of the ling," and in Miss Macleod's "Hills of Dream" we have "leagues of purple heather, of pale amethyst ling." Not only, again, in Mr. Sharp's "Vistas" —there, indeed, very notably-—but even in his "Heine" and "Robert Browning," are touches that recall the brush of Miss Macleod, and the limitations of Fiona Macleod are those of William Sharp.

But it would seem that Mr. Sharp is wearying of the double part he set himself to play. In a recent "Bookman" Fiona Maeleod and William Sharp contributed to a symposium on "John Splendid," and if these estimates of Mr. Monro's book were not conceived in the same brain, what shall we say or think? In these articles similar forms of expression may be avoided, but the methods of treatment adopted are identical, and the opinions contained therein almost perfectly correspond. If space permitted this could be shown. It seems an impossibility that the coincidences were accidental; we can only account for them on the supposition that readers were thus given the opportunity of recognising Fiona Macleod as William Sharp.

In the current "Fortnighihtly," over the signature, Fiona Macleod, appears an article on the younger Celtic poets. If this is read, in conjunction with Mr. Sharp's preface and notes to "Lyra Celtia", it will be found that one voice unquestionably speaks in both. Fiona Macleod says that W. B, Yeats has "the most haunting sense of beauty of any of our younger writers. . . the most distinction, by far the rarest touch." Of the same author William Sharp says, "He has grace of touch and distinction of form beyond any of the younger poets of Great Britain, and there is throughout his work a haunting beauty, and a haunting sense of beauty." Of Lionel Johnson's work Macleod says there is "little that, like 'The Red Wind,' strikes the Celtic note in expression"; and William Sharp agrees, "Occasionally, in 'The Red Wind,' the Celtic note makes itself audible." Fiona Macleod says that Miss Tyman (Mrs. Hinson) makes her admirers think her a sister of St. Francis of Asrisi, for surely she is the laureate of tender little things, birds, flowers, little children"; and William Sharp says that Miss Tynan "has a St. Francis-like love of birds and all defenceless creatures and humble things." Fiona Macleod thinks that Miss Sigerson's "first little book was of promise only," and William Sharp thinks also that it was "more significant in promise than achievement." And so we might proceed, but the foregoing will no doubt be sufficient.

Will Mr. Sharp deny that he is identical with Miss Macleod? That Miss Macleod is Mr. Sharp, I, for one, have not a lingering doubt, and I congratulate the latter on the success, the real magic and strength of the work issued under his assumed name.

MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY ENGLAND. Bury, Sunday.

On Saturday night a lady and gentlemen arrived at Derby Hotel in Bury, and engaged a room. The gentleman spoke broken English. The gentleman asked the barmaid to direct him to a chemist's shop. She did so, and the couple went out together. Later the gentleman ordered decanter of brandy and sercml bottles of Schweppes water. He also directed that he and his friend should not disturbed very early next morning as they were fatigued with much travelling. Nothing further was heard of them, and at two o'clock this afternoon a page boy entered the room, and found the pair in bed clasped in each other's arms, quite dead. In a letter to the coroner the deceased said it would be useless trying to discover their identity. They had agreed to die together. The lady is about thirty, and of German origin. The gentleman is a little older, and a Frenchman.

Dublin Daily Express - Monday 30 January 1899

Are we in for a new controversy on the personal identity of a celebrated writer? The article in Saturday's "Daily Chronicle", which we reproduce with slight abridgement in another column, certainly gives a good start to a discussion of this nature. The devoted advocates of the theory that Francis Bacon wrote the plays of Shakespeare have apparently exhausted all their artillery of argument, and they allow the world to go on stolidly believing in Shakespeare. But the section of it which believes in Miss Fiona Macleod is now invited, on what appear very substantial grounds, to recognise in that lady no other person than Mr. William Sharp, the distinguished critic and editor of "Lyra Celtica." We fancy that admirers of Miss Macleod will resist as strongly as they can the disappearance from their gaze of so fascinating and romnantic a personality. She has been pictured as a girl of extraordinary genius and strong individuality, brought up in seclusion by the Hibridean seas, and suddenly bursting on the world with books like "Pharais" and "The Mountain Lovers" and "The Hills of Dream," lacking, perhaps, in intellectual grasp and sübstance, but charged with the gloom, the mystery, the elemental passion, the sombre beauty of the wild nature and the wilder human life by which she was surrounded. The well-known fact that even those with whom she has been in constant correspondence and the closest literary fellowship have never been privileged to see her face, and that she never gives a private address, but maintains in the midst of her celebrity a seclusion as complete as that of an enchanted princess, has heightened the fascination of her literary personality. Mr. Sharp, we believe, speaks of her as a relative; and rumours that he is really the author of the works published under her name have for some time been current; but the assertion has hitherto been based chiefly on the fact that he was the only person who professed to have personal knowledge of her. Now we have a string of remarkable coincidences of expression, together with some external evidence of considerable weight, and the case thus presented, though, of course, by no means amounting to proof, is certainly sufficient to stagger the public faith in the romantic myths which have gathered round the romantic and beautiful name Fiona Macleod. The anonymous writer in the "Chronicle" observes that he has been unable to utilise the numbers of the "Evergreen," the periodical once issued by Professor Patrick Gedden as the organ of the Scoto-Celtic Renascence, fur purposes of comparison between Mr. Sharp's writings and hers. We have, however, been furnished with some interesting parallels from this and other sources not noted in the "Chronicle," and give them for what they may be worth. In the "Evergreen," Part IV., p. 99, Miss Macleod writes, "Sorrow upon our love, the lapsed wave sighed," and on p. 119 she has the phrase, "moveless as a lapsed wave." In Mr. Sharp's sonnet, "Midsummer Hour," we find the line, "The slow lapse of the gradual wave is heard." In the "Evergreen," Part III, p. 108, Mr. Sharp speaks of "the purple-gleaming swallows," while in Part IV., p. 99, Miss Macleod describes them as "the purple-feathered birds that have no home." In the same periodical. Part IV., p. 119, Miss Macelod, writing of a day of cloudless sun, notes that there did not fall upon the earth even "the wandering shadow of an eagle soaring from a mountain eyrie," while in the Preface to "Sonnets of this Century" Mr. Sharp describes "tiny blue-black shadow" that moves on the snow-clad slopes of Ben Ledi, and shows "that an eagle is passing from peak to lonely peak". In the "Evergreen." Part IV., p. 112, Miss Macleod says of Angus, the God of Spring, "For a thousand years the pulse of his heart has been warm against the lips of lovers." Mr. Sharp, in a sonnet addressing the "Spring Wind," has the lines:

... Hast thou, 'neath bluer skies,  
Met the warm lips that are the gates of bliss?

That there has been a very close literary sympathy between Mr. Sharp and Miss Macleod is undeniable. We imagine that, whatever the true state of the case may be, Mr. Sharp will not admit more than this. For Fiona Macleod has not been simply a veiled figure, like that of Junius. She has cultivated — through the post, "bien entendu"" — fellowships and friendships, and has been the object of a sort of cult, as her genius and her presumed personality made natural, among writers of kindred aims. The genius remains, of course; but the identity of this mystical and unapproachable star of the North with an elderly critic on the London Press would certainly, if it were established, inflict a serious shock on a good many minds. We trust, therefore, that either Miss Fiona Macleod will establish her identity or that Mr. Sharp will not break silence. If he has really created so striking a literary personality, let the vision remain, and let us believe in it as long as we can. These are not days in which we can willingly spare a beautiful illusion.

LITERATURE AND ART.

Who is Fiona Macleod? The qestion has been discussed before. A writer in the *Daily Chronicle* suggests that Mr William Sharp is the author of these weirdly beautiful Celtic stories that terrify and fascinate one. We cannot think this correct. His work in general does not suggest the Celtic strain in such a degree as that indicated in these remarkable tales. Besides, his culture is diffused, and "The Mountain Lovers," "Pharais," and others from the same pen give the impression that the writer is entirely devoted to Celtic folklore and superstition. Neither has Mr Sharp an adequate knowledge of the language. One man could, perhaps, answer the vexed question—Professor Patrick Oeddes.

WHO IS "FIONA MACLEOD?"

The best-kept literary secret the moment is that of the identity of "Miss Fiona Macleod," the authoress of the "Washer the Ford" and other eerie stories, I am told (says M.A.P.) that "Miss Macleod's letters have to be re-addressed three or four times before they come into her hands. She is known to a small circle, who keep the secret well; but no editor has managed get her photograph; though one had it in his hands. It is even doubted if "Miss Macleod's" publishers have met her. There is, however, a very shrewd suspicion that "the she is a he," and that "Miss Macleod" is no other than Mr William Sharp, the prophet of the Celtic Renaissance. Another rumour has it that "Fiona" is Mrs Sharp, who is also an authority her husband's pet subject, and a collaborator with him in his "Lyra Celtics. But there are two pieces of internal evidence which render it, to say the least, highly probable that Mr Sharp and "Miss Fiona Macleod" are one and the same person. In the first place, there are numerous phrases, sentences, and even whole passages in "Miss Macleod's" works which correspond *almost verbatim* with matter that has appeared over Mr Sharp's signature. In the second, "Miss Macleod," although she is far and away the best exponent the literary Celticism so dear to Mr Sharp's heart, is dismissed with the baldest mention in his "Lyra Celtica, while warm and lengthy commendation bestowed upon lesser fry. It is an interesting little point, which I trust Mr Sharp will enlighten us in the near future.

LITERARY NOTES AND GOSSP

...

The identity of Fiona Macleod has beae for a year or two the subject of wonderment, of speculation, and of innuendo in literary circles. It has been giren out that the author of "Pharais" is a lady relative of Mr William Sharp, but as this lady has not "materialised" as Fiona Macled, the gossips will have it that Mr Sharp has, under this pseudonym, been hastening the Celtic Renaissance by writing works imbued waith almost ultra-Celtic mysticism. This week an ingenious contributor to the "Daily Chronicle" his devoted a column to proving, to his own satisfaction, the oneness of the supposed duality of writers. Having done so, he calls upon Mr Sharp to "deny that be is identical with Miss Macleod." Mr Sharp has not, however, thought good to comply with this impertinent demand, and the question whether or not he has been the first male writer of books to assume a feminine pseudonym must await his own divulgence or the appearance in the flesh of Miss Macleod. Meanwhile, it is reassuring, if not favourable to ihe "Daily Chronicle" contributor's theory, to be told, as we are by the writer of "Books and Bookmen" in the new "Saint Andrew," that he has had notes from Miss Macleod written on perfumed paper in a neat and careful feminine hand. But Mr Sharp may use perfumed paper, and we chance to klnow that he writes a not unfeminine aand. Besides there are amanuenses. But we are content to leave the matter to Mr Sharp, and to Miss Macleod—if she exists.

LITERATURE

...

The *Daily Chronicle* has published a column article on the identity of Fiona Macleod. The writer, with considerable skill, endeavours to prove that Fiona Macleod and Mr. William Sharp are one and the same person. If this be the case, one must congratulate Mr. William Sharp on the modesty which has led him for some years now, without any apparent reason, to lose whatever personal triumph may be associated with the recognition of so much beautiful work. The *Chronicle* brings many evidences of style to indicate that Mr. Sharp has a somewhat similar vocabulary to that of Fiona Macleod. It would be easier for me, however, to believe that "Fiona Macleod" was a pseudonym that represented the joint work of Mr. and Mrs. William Sharp. For example, in the current number of *Literature* there is a poem entitled "The Crimson Moon," signed by Fiona Macleod. That, I think, must have been written by a woman. No importance, of course, need be attached to the fact that Mr. Sharp has always declared that Fiona Macleod was a cousin of his own, and that he has shown his friends the portraits of an exceedingly pretty woman as representing her. Mr. Sharp has also given very adequate reasons to his friends why Fiona Macleod should preserve her incognita, reasons that it would not be fair to make public. Of course Mr. Sharp may not care even now to enlighten us, and it can scarcely be disputed that he is entitled to please himself. It has always been understood ever since the most virtuous of authors, Sir Walter Scott, denied, "with oaths and with curses," that he was the author of the Waverley Novels, that a writer has a perfect right to tell any number of—shall we say ?—"white lies" to conceal his identity. I announced the other day at least three or four forthcoming works by Mr. William Sharp. Should the name of Fiona Macleod be one with his, this indeed should be the psychological moment for him to acknowledge the identity. We should read these new books with additional zest were they published with this double reputation behind them.

Who is Fiona Macleod? Mr. William Sharp is met on the literary highway with the alternative "Her name or her life!" If he will not produce the author, whom he has called his friend and his cousin, he is told that himself will be adjudged to be Fiona Macleod and no other. For, says one of the lady's pursuers, though she has written letters, and her photograph has been shown, nobody has ever seen her in the flesh. But on that point a correspondent can speak with authority when he says that the lady referred to by Mr. Sharp has undoubtedly an actual existence of her own. She has been seen repeatedly by her publisher, and she has been a pilgrim to at least one literary Mecca, where an English man of letters discussed with her the Celtic movement in modern literature. About two years ago she was in London on a visit, and one biographical fact at least she let drop—that she was a married woman. Of course this does not prove that she wrote the books attributed to her, either wholly or in part; but that there is a living woman who claims to be the author, and upon whom others have set eyes, is beyond dispute.

LITERARY GOSSIP

The identity of Fiona Macleod is still a secret. A little while ago some one endeavoured to prove that she and Mr. William Sharp were one and the same. Mr. Sharp replied that he was not free to say whether this was so or not. Now come witnesses who have seen Miss Macleod face to face, and who, therefore, aver that she is not Mr. Sharp, who is tall and bearded. But if so, why does not Mr. Sharp say so? Personally we care nothing. It would not move us to know that Fiona Macleod was the Pope. Meanwhile, in connection with the great problem, we note that a writer in a contemporary asks if any men have ever keen known to take feminine pseudonyms. There is a burly gentleman in knickerbockers in Hr. Henry James's story of "The Death of the Lion" who wrote as Rose Maydew (or some such name), and Lord Dufferin once produced the confessions Angelina Gushington.

It seems rather hud raying, but the principal reason for disbelieving in the theory that Mr. Sharp is Fiona Macleod is the same as for disbelieving that Bacon was Shakespeare: namely, that in their own persons both Mr. Sharp and Bacon give so few signs that they possess the power supposed to come to them with the pseudonym. Mr. Sharp has had many opportunities of signing with his genuine autograph works of weird and mystical and original imagination; but he has not, to our knowledge, taken them. Why is there, for example, so little of the Fiona Macleod quality in his slender volume of Maeterlinckian stories? We cannot believe in such heroic and persistent repression of one's best self for the sake of lending mystery to a pseudonym. Human nature is not like that.

There must now be an end of speculation in the public press as to who is Fiona Macleod. The lady who uses that name has protested. "I am much annoyed," she writes to her publishers, Messrs. Constable, "at this continued identification of myself with this or that man or woman of letters — in one or two instances with people whom I have never seen and do not even know by correspondence. For what seems to myself not only good, but imperative private reasons, I wish to preserve absolutely my privacy. It is not only that temperamentally I shrink from and dislike the publicity of reputation, but that my very writing depends upon this privacy. But in one respect, to satisfy those who will not be content to take or leave, to read or ignore my writings, I give you authority to say definitely that ' Fiona Macleod ' is not any of those with whom she has been ' identified,' that she writes only under the name of ' Fiona Macleod '; that her name is her own; and that all she asks is the courtesy both of good-breeding and common sense — a courtesy which is the right of all, and surely imperatively of a woman acting by and for herself."

LITERARY MYSTERY SOLVED

DEATH OF WILLIAM SHARP

"FIONA MACLEOD" REVEALED

The identity of Fiona MacLeod, regarding which there has always been much speculation, was revealed yesterday in an unexpected manner.

The Press Association received the following from Mr. Richard Whiteing, the author:—

"By private telegram from Sicily I am informed of the death there of the well-known English writer William Sharp, and I am authorised to reveal his authorship of the works published under the pseudonym 'Fiona MacLeod.':

Who is "Fiona Macleod"?

Who is "Fiona MacLeod"? This was the question that for years aroused the interest and piqued the curiosity all who concern themselves with literary matters this country. From the first there were many who declared ther disbelief in her existence, and very soon it was whispered that William Sharp was the author of the books that bore the name Fiona MacLeod. But if he disclaimed any hand in them he was only following Sir Walter Scott, who on one occasion denied pointblank that he had written the Waverley Novels.

This Fiona MacLeod mystification is really one the strangest stories our day. It was conducted with the finest skill, and the figure of this writer became an actual person to many readers. Paragraphs appeared at sundry times, notes were published of where she was and what work she had in hand, and her biography had a place in "Who's Who?"

Her address in that work of reference was "Care of Chapman and Hall (Limited), 11, Henrietta Street, W.C." The date of birth was not given, neither is the name of her parents published; but we are informed that her recreations were sailing, hill walks, and listening. In the edition "Who's Who?" for next year the names of three forthcoming works are menttioned—" The Immortal Hour," "The Winged Destiny,'' and The Magic Kingdoms."

LITERARY GOSSIP

...

Perhaps the Fiona Macleod mystery is not yet wholly dispersed. At any rate, the "Man of Kent," of the "British Weekly," is not convinced of the identity of Fiona Macleod with the late Mr. William Sharp. He bases his doubt on his opinion that Fiona Macleod's best work discloses knowledge and powers which Mr. Sharp did not possess. But this is not all. We are told: "I remember walking with Mr. Sharp in Surrey shortly after the first book appeared, and asking him about the authorship. He replied, with great frankness, that the authoress was a friend of his own, that she was the wife of a Highland laird, that she had been obliged to separate from her husband, and that she was most anxious to conceal her name, as if it were made known it would lead to renewal of her domestic trials. He told me this, as I say, quite frankly, and asked me to keep it a secret, and so I have kept it. I find now that he told substantially the same story to other editors."

This reaction of mystery goes still further, for the "Man of Kent" adds: "Not many years ago, I went with a friend to see a very celebrated writer, who told us that the day before William Sharp and Fiona Macleod had visited him. He spoke admiringly of Fiona Macleod's beauty and cleverness. We both remember very well what he said, but I am not going to print it all. The author I refer to was a very intimate friend of Wilham Sharp, and certainly if Sharp took a lady to personate the character of Fiona Macleod, it was a very daring act of mystification." All this is very strange, and it does seem possible that the simple statement which has gone forth in regard to Fiona Macleod may not embody all the facts.

ACCORDING to Miss Fiona Macleod, the superstitious custom of sin-eating prevailed at one time in the Scotch Highlands. The sin-eater did pretty much the same thing there as lie is alleged to have done in Wales. Salt was placed on the breast of the deceased, and a piece of bread on the salt. This bread was eaten by the sin-eater, who thereby took into himself, as it were, all the sins of the dead man. In Scotland, however, there is one welcome feature which, as far as our present knowledge goes, was absent in Wales. This feature admirably illustrates the delightful prudence and cautiousness of the canny sons of Caledonia. In cases where the sin-eater was not personally acquainted with the deceased, there was no moral responsibility involved in the function that is to say, the sin-eater did not take upon himself the sins of a dead man who was a stranger to him. What a fine loophole of escape that was! Our ancestors did not show so much 'cuteness. Mr. Sidney Hartland still adheres to his contention that the custom did exist in Wales. In a series of able letters to the Academy he deals with the available data, and apparently makes out a pretty strong case.

MEN AND MATTERS.

IS FIONA MACLEOD DEAD?

"Cluadius Clear", in the "British Weekly", is not quite prepared to accept the statement that the late William Sharp was Fiona Macleod. Among other things, he says: "The early works of Fiona Macleod, the three volumes published by Patrick Geddes, were infinitely above anything that William Sharp accomplished in his own name. These three volumes are all that really matter in the Fiona Macleod work. Further. they imply a range of knowledge which William Sharp did not possess, so far as I know. When afterwards the interesting collections of Carmichael were published, it turned out that several things in the Patrick Geddes books were genuinely Celtic." The three books referred to "Claudius Clear" regards as "among the highest acheievments of the imagination."

A STATEMENT BY SHARP.

Shortly after the first book appeared "Claadius Clear" was walking with Mr. Sharp in Surrey, and asked him about the authorship: "He replied, with great frankness, that the authoress was a friend of own, that she was the wife of a Highland laird, that she had been obliged to separate from her husband, and that she was most anxious to conceal her name, as if it were made known it would lead to renewal of her domestic trials. He told me this, as I say, quite frankly, and asked me to keep it secret, and so I have kept it." Not many years ago a celebrated writer whom he was visiting told "Claudius Clear" that the day before William Sharp and Fiona Macleod had visited him. He spoke admiringly of Fiona Macleod's beauty and cleverness This author was a very intimate friend of William Sharp, and if Sharp took a lady to personate the character of Fiona Macleod it was, "Claudius Clear" thinks, a very daring act of mystification.

OTHR TESTIMONY

"Alan Northman." in the "Sunday School Chronicle," also makes an interesting statement on the "mystery," which was solved for him eight or nine years ago by an odd circumstance. The statement is to the effect that Mr. Alexander Carmichael, of Edinburgh, the well known Celtic scholar, whose lifework had been the collecting of unwritten Highland hymns and poems of the Western Isles, had lent a great deal of his collected material to Mr. William Sharp for his private perusal:

Mr. Sharp kept the manuscript longer than its owner had bargained for, and they had some difficutly in getting it back, if I remember rightly. No remark was made to any use having been made of the material which was designed to form part of a great Highland anthology that Mr. Carmichael was preparing. Shortly afterwards "Fiona Macleod" published "Pharais," and, to the astonishmemt of Mr. Carmichael and his daughter, the book contained verses and material which could only have been got from the manuscript lent to Mr. Sharp.

Mr. Sharp was of course, communicated with. He repudiated his identity with "Fiona Macleod," but gave no satisfactory explanation of how Mr. Carmichael's material had found its way into his book.

THE "LITERARY MYSTERY": SHARP'S CLAIM DOUBTED.

One wonders is the Fiona MacLeod mystery likely to rival the great literary dispute over the authorship of the letters of Junius. The public at first were inclined to accept the posthumous claim made on behalf of William Share that he was the writer who, under the assumed name of Fiona MacLeod, delighted readers of Celtic literature. But reflection and examination do not tend to confirm that view. In the "British Weekly" Dr. Robertson Nicoll, the well-known critic and friend of Sharp, adduces various reasons for believing that the mystery was not by the supposed deathbed confession of Wm. Sharp. Not only did that writer repeatedly deny that he was Fiona MacLeod, but he gave circumstantial accounts of her personality. and even introduced to a literary friend a lady under that name. The internal evidence is eqaelly unsatisfactory to the claim made on behalf of William Sharp by some of his friends. The abaence of motive for the concealment of the authorship, the marked difference of handwriting and, above all, the marked superiority in style and range of knowledge of the works of Fiona MacLeod to the admitted writings of William Sharp all support the theory that the two names represent distinct indiviutalities. If so, the question arises is Fiona MacLeod still alive? a point which can easiest be set at rest by the production of another work from her pen.

BOOKS AND THEIR WRITERS

...

No-one ever believed me when I maintained that the works of "Fiona Macleod" were written by William Sharp . And I wish from the bottom of my heart that they were still unconvinced. But Sharp is dead, and one is reminded of the phrase "murder will out." For when the news of his death came from Sicily, Mr Richard Whiteing, the author of the famous *no. 5, John Street*, communicated to the press that he was authorised to reveal the identity of "Fiona Macleod" with William Sharp. I guessed the truth from the letter Sharp wrote announcing *her* first book. I have little doubt that the reason he had for adopting this pseudonym was that his reputation as an editor was so great as to swamp the importance of his imaginative writing. As an editor William Sharp will be remembered with men like Robert Chambers or Bell, for in the *Canterbury Poets* and other allied series he enriched almost every home in Great Britain with admirable cheap editions of English classics, especially poetical. He was a good poet himself, and a first-class critic and writer upon literature and travel. He was a brilliant conversationalist, and a delightful friend. As an author he never received his due recognition, for people persisted in regarding him rather as a contributor to the great reviews. But time will right that, and the immense amount of good work he left behind him in many fields will make his memory secure, when some of the most popular writers of the day have passed into the limbo, where the writers of dusty romances form a queue headed by Mrs Centlivre.

"Fiona MacLeod." Discussion has long raged in the literary world as to who was "Fiona MacLeod." The regretted death of Mr. William Sharp has enabled his friend, Mr. Richard Whiteing, the well-known novelist, to reveal the fact that the deceased was "Fiona McLeod." Some people thought they recognised a similarity in style in the work done by "Fiona MacLeod" and the writings signed by Mr. Sharp, but when the author was tackled on the point he denied the happy responsibility. On one occasion he wrote to his publishers protesting that "she" was a woman, and Fiona MacLeod her own name, and apparently no one knew the secret except the author's closest friend, Mr. Richard Whiteing. The deceased writer was not quite fifty years of age, but he had been a great worker.

"FIONA MACLEOD."

Yesterday, we referred to the fact brought to light by death, that Mr. William Sharp and "Fiona Macleod" were one and the same person. Fiona MacLeod was one of the recongeised authors of the time. In "Who's Who," the mysterious writer's recreations are given as "sailing , hill walks, and listening." In another page of "Who's Who" is a biography of Mr. William Sharp, critic, poet, and interviewer. He was born in 1856; his recreations are "frequent change of scene and environment: in summer, roaming, sailing. and swimming."

Only a month ago "Who is Fiona Macleod?" was the subject of an article in a literary journal in the North, and the writer could not know how soon his prophecy that "we shall never in her lifetime be taken into the secret" of authorship would find fulfilment. The Gaelic-reading Highlanders long since discovered in the works of Fiona Macleod, it was stated, the most amusing evidence that she was ignorant of Gaelic both grammatically and colloquially. The Inverness Gaelic Society has on several occasions lamented that the work of Fiona Macleod should pass in the Lowlands as authentic.

Who is Fiona Macleod?

The mystery of the identity and sex of Fiona Macleod, the Celtic poet, is forever being approached by admirers, anxious to get at the truth of the rumoirs that this mysterious author is William Sharp, W.B. Yeats and others. Seldom, however, is so point blank a query raised as was put to Mr. Yeats on his visit to New York.

He was entertained at dinner in Brooklyn, and one of the guests, a woman who admired his work and had been anxious to meet him, was unfortunately seated at the far end of the table. The dinner was half over before she had opportunity to address him. Then, in a lull in the talk, she leaned forward.

"Oh Mr Yeats". she said.

She is a very pretty woman and her eagerness made her doubly attractive.

"Do tell us," she demanded, "whether Fiona Macloed, whom we adore, is your wife?"

Mr Yeats regarded her for a moment with his never failing quizzical smile.

"Why, no, indeed, Mrs. B———," said he, "may I ask if he is your husband?"

A LITERARY ROMANCE.

The identity of the Celtic poet and writer "Fiona Macleod" has at last been made known. Mr. Richard Whiteing, the novelist, announces that the works published under this pseudonym were from the pen of his intimate friend Mr. William Sharp, who died recently in Sicily. Before he adopted it his works received indifferent notices from the critics; afterwards they were enthusiastic, he resolved to keep his secret with few of his most intimate friends. While William Sharp was best known in connection with the publishing house of Waiter Scott, "Fiona Macleod" published in England, through Messrs. Chapman and Hall. For the Scott Publishing Company he edited the "Canterbury Poets," and his masterly preface to "Sonnets of this Century" is one of the standard treatises on the subject, and has passed through over a score of editions. His life of Browning in the "Great Writers" series was one the best critical studies of the poet ever written, and Heine and Shelley were also dealt with by him in the same series. He also edited several volumes of the "Camelot Classics." In his earlier days he wrote a number of boys' stories such as "The Last of the Vikings and Red Riders"; and among his works "Fiona Macleod" were "Pharais, From the Hills of Dream," and "The Sin Eater." Mr. Sharp was at first a bank clerk in London, but, it is related, he went one day to "hear the cuckoo," and his love of Nature could not brook confinement, and took to the fields—and the pen.

OUR LONDON LETTER

(BY "JOURNAL" SPECIAL WIRE)

"Is there still one part Fiona Maclecd alive in the world?" asks Nicoll. This is the first doubt cast upon the statement that the late William Sharp wrote all books published under that name. If, says Dr Nicoll, William Sharp did write all these books, then the underlying principles of the higher criticism are more than ever doubt. Nicoll is willing to admit that some of the books were influenced by Sharp, but the first three volumes, "all that really matter, are infinitely above anything that William Sharp accomplished his own name." In addition, they imply a range of knowledge which the deceased writer did not, in the opinion of Dr Nicoll, posses. Walking one day with Sharp, Dr Nicoll asked him who was Fiona Macleod. With the utmost frankness, he said she was the wife of a Highland laird from whom one was separated, and that she was most anxious to conceal her name, for, if it were made known, it would lead to a renewal of her domestic trials. A "celebrated writer" informed Dr Nicoll that William Sharp had brought Fiona Macleod to visit him, and spoke admiringly of the lady's beauty and cleverness. Even this, however, might have been daring impersonation. Letters from Fiona Macleod received by Dr Nicoll contained two handwritings. One was very different from Sharp's writing, though the other might have been a variation of his style.

vol 1

When the secret of the identity of Fiona Macleod — so loyally guarded by a number of friends for twelve years — was finally made known, much speculation arose as to the nature of the dual element that had found expression in the collective work of William ^ Sharp. Many suggestions, wide of the mark, were advanced; among others, that the writer having assumed it, had found himself constrained to continue its use. A few of the critics understood. Prof. Patrick Geddes realised that the discussion was productive of further misunderstanding, and wrote to me: "Should you not explain that F. M. was not simply W. S., but that W. S. in his deepest moods became F. M., a sort of dual personality in short, not a mere nom-de-guerre? "

It was not expedient for me at that moment to do so. I have preferred to wait till I could prepare as adequate an explanation as possible. My chief aim, therefore, in writing about my husband and in giving a sketch of his life, has been to indicate, to the best of my ability, the growth and development in his work of the dual literary expression of himself.

A LITERARY SENSATION

"Fiona Macleod." By Richard Whiteing

"Fiona Macleod" was the greatest of his own creations in fiction. She had never any existence whatever, except in his brain, and yet she was a living, real personality with all the charm of the most delicate and sympathetic womanhood. I am not exactly concerned to defend him for the part he made her play; it is quite enough to take the motive into account. He felt his Keltic poetry intensely; he took enormous pains about it. He knew what it was to live in lonely fishermen s huts in the remotest highlands, and to make his wonderful studies of cloud and sea and storm under conditions that would have appalled many an old salt. He had an idea — perhaps a fanciful one — that he had enemies in the press, and that to give his Keltic muse the best chance she should be wholly dissociated from his name. In this way "Fiona" came into the world. She started fair without any critical prejudice against her, and to say the truth with a charm of her own, for her utterances gained by the change of personality. She at once obtained the hearing which was some times denied to the author of her being.

But then came the nemesis. Criticism, even while it was still laudatory, soon began to suspect that there was "no such person." He had to go on with the mystification or to make enemies for her as well as for himself. He had an illustrious example before him in his countryman, Scott, and he followed it— unwillingly, I believe, at last, yet with the pain tempered by a sense of amusement. He swore us all to secrecy, yet human nature being what it is he was sometimes betrayed by the flush of his own cheek when she was praised to his face. No writer of "Fiona's" sex will cast a stone at him. How many of them have had to adopt a masculine pseudonym to win a chance for their work?

As a traveller by temperament I never knew his like, except perhaps Verestchagin, the Russian painter. Both were what I call "spur-of-the moment" men; they would make up their minds in a flash to start for the uttermost ends of the earth.

[IMAGE OF WILLIAM SHARP: "FIONA MACLEOD" (Elliott & Fry) William Sharp, born in Scotland. Septem ber 12, 1856, died in Sicily, December 12, 1905. He edited "The Canterbury Poets," travelled a great deal, and wrote many books, including those signed by "Fiona Macleod," whose identity his death alone revealed.]

He seemed to take no thought of packing, hut in that I fancy he had one other to take thought for him. Only he could have written the *Literary Geography* — as it was written — almost in one swish of impression of the things seen. He made one or two attempts at quiet homekeeping in London, but nothing came of them.

The serious side of him was very serious indeed. He loved to shut himself up with someone entirely sympathetic and talk Keltic mystery by the hour. He was one of a race apart, the born believers who have that aptitude as others have the sense of colour. He had the ease of the Swedenborgian adepts in moving amongst the figures of a shadow land. I think this had a good deal to do with his creation of "Fiona." She soon ceased to be a mere pseudonym. He gradually perfected his own conception until she became a thing of perfect womanhood and, as I have said, the greatest of his characters. He not only thought in her name but he pictured her in his mind. At one time, I believe, there was actually a portrait of her published, which, of course, he selected or inspired. He wrote letters for her in answer to the bundles received through the publishers, some of them, I believe, containing passionate offers of heart and hand.

His life was one long physical martyrdom, but of that little can be said here. He suffered from incurable heart complaint, and at times dared hardly lift a book for fear of the worst. There were other troubles now and then needing sudden surgical treatment — sometimes in foreign cities where he could get no proper care. He would rise from the operating table to take the train. None might have guessed it in build and look and manner he seemed like a sort of giant fresh-coloured boy.

His wife, the accomplished critic of art who helped him so largely in all his work, saw every departure with foreboding when she was not with him. At length she insisted on his not travelling alone, and she was by his side when the end came. They were on a visit at the time'of his death on Tuesday last week to an old friend, the Duke of Bronté, a grandnephew, I believe, of Nelson, and the inheritor of the Sicilian title.

A FEW DAYS AGO

...

*The St. James's Gazette* in a leading article entitled "Grey Lies" has been saying some ingenious things about the guarding of pseudonyms. It seems that the late William Sharp actually once denied in so many words that he and Fiona Macleod were one. This was a grey lie grey because it was not beneficial like a white lie or harmful like a black one, but comes between the two. I have no strong views myself on the moralitv of the matter. One prefers to tell the truth if possible, but certainly what money there may have been in "Fiona Macleod's" writings would, I fear, have quickly disappeared were it known for a fact that Mr. Sharp was their author. For the difference in merit between the work of Mr. Sharp and the work of Fiona Macleod is to me far more in teresting than this secret of authorship. Mr. Sharp, to my knowledge, never carried conviction and was often a very obvious pot-boiler but some of "Fiona Macleod's" prose is exquisite. It is an extraordinary case of the value of inventing a dramatic mouthpiece. V. V. V.

FIONA MACLEOD.

"FIONA MACLEOD"

It was with feelings of sorrow mingled to a considerable extent with surprise, that I received a communication from Mr. Frank Rinder informing me that the well-known critic and *littérateur*, Mr. William Sharp, died in Sicily on Tuesday last. This, in itself, would have been a matter for genuine regret to one who has been interested in Mr. Sharp's career since those early days when he was best known as a figure in what was left of the small band of Pre-Raphaelites; but what gave additional point to one's grief was that my correspondent was authorised by Mrs. Sharp to divulge the secret, known previously only within a very small circle, that William Sharp was the writer of every word that proceeded from the pen of "Miss Fiona Macleod." The circumstance will pass into literary history as one of the strangest incidents recorded. It is perfectly natural to draw a comparison between this case and that of Macpherson and his Ossian, but the comparison would be misleading. Macpherson invented Ossian or the purpose of passing off certain of his own works as those of the ancient Gaelic Bards. What William Sharp did was quite different. He was one of those few people who seem to have inherited a dual personality, and he was able to keep its parts entirely separate. It was as if a man and a woman were joined together in one person—and it is of the woman that I would speak here. Probably there are not any editors who are better qualified to do so, since not only did a great deal of "Fiona Macleod's" printed matter pass primarily through my hands, but during the last few years, she (I cannot bring myself to say he) has been one of my most constant and voluminous correspondents. Indeed, the last book proceeding from that pen which will never be busy again was to have been dedicated to me, and perhaps there may be some interest in copying out what was said.

THE DEDICATION OF "THE HOUR OF BEAUTY" -
Dear Mr. ——— To whom so fittingly as to you could I inscribe this book? It was you who suggested it; you who in ——— published at intervals, longer or shorter as the errant spirit of composition moved me, the several papers which make it one book; you without whose encouragement and good counsel this volume would probably not have been written. Then, perchance, it might have gone to that Y-Brasil Press in the Country of the Young, wherefrom are issued all the delightful books which, though possible and welcome in Tir-na-n'Og, are unachieved in this more difficult world, except in dreams and hopes. It would be good to have readers among the kindly Shee . . . do not the poets there know an easy time, having only to breathe their thought on to a leaf and to whisper their music to a reed, and lo the poem is public from the caverns of Tir-fo-tuinn to the hills of Flatheanas!. . . but, till one gets behind the foam yonder, - the desire of the heart is for comrades here. These hours of beauty have meant so much to me, somewhat in the writing, but much more in the long, incalculable hours and days out of which the writing has risen like the blue smoke out of woods, that I want to share them with others, who may care for the things written of as you and I care for them, and among whom may be a few who, likewise, will be moved to tee from each day of the eternal pageant one hour of unforgettable beauty.  
Fiona Macleod.

I had been greatly taken by some of the poems published in her early career, the first of which, by-the-bye, came to me not through the original volumes but by way of a review which, contained amongst other things, lines that made an undying impression on my mind. I quote them from memory, but they run something like this :

Never shall I feel your lips in my hair,  
Naming my name.

So "Fiona Macleod" was written to, and in due time replied, sending what I shall always consider one of the most beautiful of her poems, "Deirdre is Dead" :

It is said that the dead sing, though we have no ears to hear,  
And that whoso lists is lickt up of the Shadow too, because of fear—

But this would give me no fear, that I heard a sighing song from her lips:  
No, but as the green heart of an upthrust towering billow slips

Down into the green hollow of the ingathering wave,  
So would I slip, and sink, and drown, in her grassy grave.

This poem was to be the precursor of many other pieces both in verse and prose. Personally I made no endeavour to pierce the identity of my correspondent, although, by a curious coincidence, on one occasion a letter was forwarded to me dated from the very hotel at which I was staying. A glance at the visitors' book would probably have settled the matter there and then!

It is scarcely to be believed that a man could write as "Fiona Macleod" did. I remember I was once struck by a certain preciosity in my correspondent's language; and, partly to amuse her and partly to make a sudden break from the excessively choice language she was fond of employing, I wrote (she was staying in Italy for the sake of her health) that I hoped she was getting better and would come back "full of beans." Mr. Sharp—if he were Mr. Sharp—showed this letter to a number of Greek magnates with whom he was yachting at the time, and the result was several long pages of chaff about the difficulty experienced bv these foreigners in understanding the slang phrase. The letter was most amusing, though one would not care to publish it now that the consent of the writer can no longer be obtained. It helped at the time, however, to fill out a picture of a remarkable mind.

Mr. Sharp did not so much play the part of a woman as show that there was a woman within him. The only danger of letting the secret out arose from certain of his tastes that had been developed in the literary life of London. Time was when Mr. Sharp was a central figure in the coteries of the capital. The company he was in the habit of meeting no doubt helped in a large measure to bring out the esthetic side of his character; and his fine taste—not only in letters but in pictures and the ordinary things of life—which is plainly expressed in these letters, was not quite what one would expect in a woman who was supposed to spend the greater part of her life among wild Highlanders. Frequently, too, sentences occurred that could not possibly have been written by amy except one who had been in the habit of discussing details of book-production. Again, I have often found that original writers are absolutely ignorant of the more rudimentary work of journalism, and, if asked to do any of it, perform their task in a manner entirely their own and different from that of any one else. But on more than one occasion "Fiona Macleod" wrote in the tone of a practised and experienced reviewer. It was evident that work of this kind had been quite common to the writer at one period of her life. All the greater is the miracle. There is no doubt of the sincerity with which Mr. Sharp rendered the old Highland poetry and his impressions of sea and land. The natural tory, too, was more accurate than is usual in a woman.

It is not for us to attempt at this hour any general appreciation of the work done by this dual writer. No one will deny the fact that some of the poems themselves, whatever were their origin, belong to the very highest rank, while. the prose at its best will compare with that of any writer of the open air, of old. Nevertheless a certain languor had become noticeable of late: the writing grew more manrered, and it began to show evidence that the author was chewing the cud of ancient material rather than garnering new. It is, however, curious that the last four poems received by me from "Fiona Macleod" differ entirely in character from those that had been previously received—as if the writer had suddenly decided that a new departure was necessary. Would that we could have watched the new efforts of this versatile talent! We know that it would have been, in any case, interesting and distinguished: it might have added another page to the history of English Literature. But all this is ended, and we must leave to another occasion the task of discussing the visible career of Mr. William Sharp. He interested me chiefly, I will not say only, when he appeared in the garb of a Highland seer and called himself "Fiona Macleod."

Sharp (Fiona Macleod): A Memoir. Compiled by his wife, Elizabeth Sharp. Duffield @ Co. $3.75 net. The writer who used the name "Fiona
Macleod" has been brought into prominence by the publication of a revised and collected edition of his works and by an admirable biography (though a little too long) from the hand of his wife. For twelve years, until his death in 1905 permitted the revelation, his identity with the mysterious writer of the Highlands was kept secret by the small circle to whom it was known, When the secret o* Fiona's existence was revealed, there rose in its place the question of Mr. Sharp's double activity—for all through this time he had purposely kept up his critical writing under his own name —and certain amateur psychologists began to spread the rumor of a mysterious dual personality in the man, as if he had really possessed two souls, one masculine and Saxon, the other feminine and Celtic. It is evident that Mr. Sharp liked to puzzle himself and those who were in the secret by posing as one under an extraordinary inspiration. As a matter of fact, there is nothing at all supernatural or even very strange in the matter. From a child the wistful, mystery-mongering vein that runs through the books of Fiona Macleod was marked in William Sharp, and if most of the writings before he assumed the Gaelic name show the ordinary qualities of Anglo-Saxon London, that was simply because he wrote for the market what the market demanded.

William Sharp was born at Paisley in 1855, and was in childhood very delicate. By his Highland nurse, Barbara, he was initiated into the vague super stitions of the Gael, to which he added the dreams and adventures of his own brooding, half-nurtured soul. Mrs. Sharp tells of having heard him speak often of a gentle white Lady of the Woods, who appeared to him in childhood by a well in Argyll, and threw upon him "blueness out of the flowers, as one might lift foam out of a pool." In later years, vacations passed in the western Highlands and on the Hebridean islands reinforced his imagination with the nature myths that still haunted those distant and then almost unvisited places. In particular, he came to love the lonely island of Iona, with its long-remembered traitions of the great Columba, who had come thither from Ireland, bringing to the new land the Gospel of Christ, not as an enemy, but as a friend of the pagan gods of nature. On that island, he became acquainted with an old fisherman, Seumas Macleod, who took the child of seven on his knee one day and made him pray to "Her," the spirit-woman at the heart of the world, and who, as he wrote long afterwards in a letter, "was indeed the father of Fiona." And elsewhere he tells of coming once as a boy of sixteen upon the old man at sunrise standing with his face to the sea and with his bonnet removed from his long white locks; and when the boy spoke to Seumas (seeing he was not "at his prayers"), the old man replied simply, In Gaelic of course: "Every morning like this, I take my hat off to the beauty of the world."

When Sharp was twelve years old his parents moved to Glasgow, and the boy was sent to the academy in that city. In 1871 he was enrolled as a student at the Glasgow University, where he remained for two years, leaving withjout taking a degree. He thereupon entered the office of a firm of Glasgow lawyers. Here for two years he is said to have allowed himself only four out of the twenty-four hours for sleep, wasting his strength, not on the law it may be supposed, but on more attractive studies. His health, always precarious, broke under the strain, and he was ship- /ped off to Australia. The new world did not satisfy him, and he was soon back in Scotland, where he spent a year of idleness. In 1878 he came to London and took a place in a bank; but literature still lured him on, and after a while he threw himself on his pen for support and gradually through many hardships and moments of despair won for himself an acknowledged and profitable hold on the publishers. Naturally, as a servant of the press he wrote what the readers of magazines and popular biographies desired, hiding close in his heart the wayward mysticism and the grandiose philosophy he had learned from nature. Yet those deeper springs of inspiration were never forgotten, and in his intimate letters we hear continually of great projected epics and other poems that were to solve all the riddles of life. From the specimens of these suppressed masterpieces given by Mrs. Sharp in the biography, we conjecture that their loss to the world is not deplorable.

By the year 1892, when Sharp was thirty-seven, he was in a position to command his own time to a certain extent, and with his wife he settled down for a while in a little cottage near Rudgwick, Sussex. Here came the inspiration of Fiona Macleod.

It is not strange that Sharp should have taken a woman's name. He had for one thing the inspiration of a lately found friend in Rome, of whom we get only tantalizing glimpses in the biography and in his dedications—the woman who stood to him as a personification of the Anima Celtica, the Celtic Soul still brooding, as he describes it, in the "Land of Promise, whose borders shine with the loveliness of all forfeited, or lost, or banished dreams and realities of Beauty." Moreover, the feminine element, the Ewig-Weibliche, has always predominated in the ideals of the romantic Schwéirmerei, and it was natural that this latest incarnation of the old hopes and dreams should have appeared in the disguise of a woman. The particular name is easily accounted for. "Macleod" |he took from his old friend and mentor of Iona, and "Fiona" is the nearest highjland appellation he could find to the 'name of the island which meant so much to his theory of inspiration.
The earliest book to appear under the new signature was "Pharais," published in 1894; "The Mountain Lovers," which with "Pharais" forms the first volume of the collected works, came out in 1896, and thereafter, for the ten remaining years of Sharp's life, there was a succession of stories, sketches, essays, poems, and dramas, making in the complete edition seven fair-sized volumes. "Pharais" caught the attention of the discerning at once, and the interest in the unknown writer never flagged. She became a cult with some, and with others a recurring escape from the world and from thought.

With advancing years, the restlessness that had been characteristic of Sharp's temperament from childhood grew to what can only be described as morbid excess. The first glimpse we have of him as a baby is in the guise of a run-away storming the make-believe castles of fairyland, and, at the end, until held in the leash by ill-health, we see him drifting, or rather running, from place to place, seeking excitement from the sea or peace from the hills, always in a feverish haste to overtake some vanishing, unimaginable goal of the heart's desire. He died in Sicily in 1905, beloved and regretted by those who knew him.

Mr. Sharp apparently valued most the later writings, in which the human motives disappear in a haze of disorganized symbolism, whereas the less enthusiastic reader is likely to find his interest centring, with some minor exceptions, in the tales of "Pharais" and "The Mountain Lovers." There the discipline Sharp had acquired from his long apprenticeship to the press kept him within the bounds of reason, while the new freedom and Celtic inspiration added a note that is not common in English fiction. There is more of passion in "The Mountain Lovers"; and the scenes about the lonely pool, the terrible unrelenting love and madness of the blind old man, the elfish fear and wisdom of the dwarf, the yearning of the girl Oona that a soul may be born in her wild, woodland worshipper—the whole tissue of emotions in this solitude haunted by the magic influence of forgotten gods is almost unbearably dark and tragic. But on the whole, "Pharais," with its calmer beauty and subtler pathos, is the finer work; Fiona Macleod never equalled that first lovely creation.

Having found his public in these two tales, Mr. Sharp, one may say, a little abused their good nature. A few of the shorter stories have a weird beauty not without some relation to human experience, and some of the nature-essays written at the very end of his life and
brought together under the title of.

"Where the Forest Murmurs" display an intimate union of symbolism and real observation such as many in these later days have attempted but few have) special character of the Celts, and they achieved. If he had written always in symbolize. Many of the old Gaelic superstitions and legends he has attempted to revivify strike one in his rendering as merely meaningless day-dreams. Though he never united himself unreservedly with the Irish Celtic movement and deprecated its too common hostility to everything Saxon, yet in his inability to distinguish between an idea or a clear emotion and the flutterings of a sick fancy he fell too often into vaporous nonsense that makes the loosest imaginings of "A. E." or Mr. Yeats seem solid and compact of reason. Possibly he deceived himself into thinking that he was dealing with real ideas and genuine emotions; in truth he was playing with an empty convention. Take a stanza of his poems—almost any stanza will do—

Oh, fair immaculate rose of the world, rose of my dream, my Rose!  
Beyond the ultimate gates of dream I have heard thy mystical call:  
It is where the rainbow of hope suspends and the river of rapture flows—  
And the cool sweet dews from the wells of peace for ever fall.

Now it is possible that these phrases— "rose of my dream," "ultimate gates of dream," "rainbow of hope," "river of rapture," "wells of peace"—it is quite possible that these phrases when first struck out corresponded to some yearning for an ideal clearly conceived and strongly desired, but as they are used and endlessly reiterated by Mr. Sharp, and by others of his school, they become a mere poetic convention emptier of content than the clichés of the pseudo-classical writers. They require no effort on the part of the poet and mean nothing to the reader. One remembers the Grand Academy of Lagado which was once visited by a certain Mr. Gulliver, and the pleasant device of the academicians to produce literature without waste of brain. Something like that might seem to be the method employed in turning out a good deal of this late romantic prose and verse. All you need do is to have a frame of shifting blocks on which are inscribed severally the conventional phrases, and then by the turn of a crank to throw them into new combinations, and the thing is done.

In fact, there is at the base of all this literature, a double misunderstanding. Mr. Sharp and those who were working with him believed that they were renewing the old Celtic idealism and that, in this revival, there was the prophecy of a great spiritual and imaginative renovation for the world; whereas, in fact, their inspiration came essentially from a source that had little to do with any that vein he would have accomplished 'are the fag end of a movement, rather something memorable and large in Engthan the forerunners of anything. Somelish letters; but too often the symbolism runs quite away with him and leaves one vaguely wondering whether
thing of the old Celtic imagination may 'have been caught up by these young en-
thusiasts. The mere use of the myths
of their emotional
167 content, and the new and the old schools of the Celt are bound to have some traits in common— the sense of fateful brooding, the feeling of dark and bright powers concealed in nature and working mysteriously upon human destiny, the conception of passions as forces that have a strange life in themselves and come into the hearts of men as.if they were independent creatures, the sense of unearthly yet very real beauty, the haunting belief in a supernatural world that lies now far away in the unattainabie West, and now buried beneath our feet or just trembling into vision, the mixture of yearning and fear that is felt toward that world as a source of incalculable joys and dark forgetful madness to those who break in upon its secret reserve. But withal the essential spirit of the sagas is quite different from that of these imitators. The light in the old tales is hard and sharp and brilliant, whereas our new writers love to merge the outlines of nature in an all-obliterating monotonous gray. The heroes in the sagas are men and women that throb with insatiable life, and the emotions of these men, whatever mysticism may envelop their source, are the stark, mortal passions of love and greed and hatred and revenge and lamentable grief.

The real source of this Celtic revival is in the romantic revolt of the eighteenth century—in Blake and Chatterton, and that whole movement—to which must be added the influences of Maeterlinck and the other modern pseudo-mystics of the Continent. It does not bear on its face so much the light of dawn as the twilight that pre cedes the night. It is the fading end of a great inspiration, not the promise of a new world. It is often obscure and meaningless, and sometimes silly; but at its best it carries a gleam of haunted and pathetic loveliness.

A LITERARY LETTER

...

If the Celtic movement in Ireland finds some of its most striking expression in Mr. W. B. Yeats to the extent indeed that makes ill-informed English people assume that Mr. Yeats actually founded the modern Celtic Revival, with which he actually had nothing to do, the Scots aspect of that Celtic movement has had perhaps its most popular expression in Fiona Macleod. One must admire the courage of Mr. William Heinemann, however, in publishing the complete works of Fiona Macleod in seven substantial volumes.

I have always thought that, in a certain measure, the general acceptance of this work had been due to the mystery as to its authorship, and I have suspected the judgment of those people who during poor William Sharp's lifetime told us that lie could not have, written these various fantasies. They never seemed to me quite so good as some people believed.

America took up Fiona Macleod even more zealously than England, and presumably Mr. Heinemann will sell his edition of Fiona Macleod's works there. It is a beautiful set of volumes in any case. I am more interested in Mrs. William Sharp's life of her husband, who, I need not tell my readers, was indisputably Fiona Macleod.

William Sharp was one of the handsomest men that I have ever met and one of the most charming. Before I had met him I had a prejudice against him based upon the fact that I thought his little book on Heine was thoroughly bad and lacking in any special German feeling. I see from his biography, however, that his book evoked the appreciation of Mr. George Meredith, Dr. Garnett, and other more capable judges of what biography should be. But to know William Sharp was to feel quite indifferent as to whether he had written a good book or not. His was a most winning personality, and I am not surprised at the evidence his biography affords of his faculty for making friends. He knew everyone of his generation who was worth knowing, and there are interesting glimpses in this volume of Mr. Walter Pater, Mr. Meredith, and a host of others.

The book, which is entitled *William Sharp. a Memoir* (William Heinemann), is divided into two parts, the second of which is taken up with Mr. Sharp's achievements under the pseudonym of "Fiona Macleod." Looking backward at the various means by which Sharp defended his pseudonym from prying curiosity one sees that it was splendid. Only half-a-dozen friends were in the secret at any time, and he elaborated the deception in most curious forms. I recall on one occasion being the guest of Mr. Sharp and his accomplished wife at Hampstead, and at a quiet moment lie took up a photograph of an exceedingly good-looking girl and said, "This is a portrait of Fiona Macleod."

With other friends Mr. Sharp carried the matter further. He took a young lady cousin down to Mr. Meredith at Box Hill and introduced her as Fiona Macleod, allowing Meredith to pay her compliments upon her poetry in that grand style of which he was a master. He took the same young lady — a cousin I think — to one of those interesting symposiums which Mr. W. B. Yeats was once in the habit of holding on certain evenings in Bloomsbury.

Long after I had made his acquaintance I received letters signed Fiona Macleod in a handwriting one now sees was only his own written backwards but was certainly wonderfully disguised. Well, Mr. Sharp had the justification afforded by Sir Walter Scott, who was equally ready to demonstrate that he was not the author of the Waverley novels. Scott lied, if lying it can be called, with equal fertility.

But I think it may reasonably be urged that if an author who wishes to live a second life in literature has a perfect right thus to preserve that separate identity from all inquiry, and I am not quite sure that it was fair of Mr. William Archer to have displayed his literary acumen as he did on one occasion in the columns of *The Daily Chronicle* by a very clear demonstration that Fiona Macleod and William Sharp were one and the same person.

Personally, even with the work of Fiona Macleod thrown in, I have never felt quite so much interest in Mr. Sharp's literary achievement as others have done, and therefore I feel well-nigh incapable of criticising him and his work, but I do feel that there shines forth from these pages of biography and letters a most delightful personality, and I shall always think of William Sharp as one of the most lovable men I have ever met.

A LITERARY LETTER

I find a few weeks ago when reviewing Mrs. Sharp's life of her husband, William Sharp, that I attributed a certain article in *The Daily Chronicle* which first revealed to the world that Fiona Macleod and William Sharp were one person to Mr. William Archer. I have had a letter from the Rev. R. Wilkins Rees of Blackburn informing me that he was the author of the article in question, which was headed, "Who was Fiona Macleod a Study of Two Styles." Mr. Rees informed me further that all the Fiona Macleod letters that he has seen were written by William Sharp's sister, but certainly some of the letters in my possession from Fiona Macleod give the suggestion of Sharp's handwriting written backwards.
