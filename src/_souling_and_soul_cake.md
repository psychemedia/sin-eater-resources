# Souling and Soul-Cake

One of the claimed benefits of the ministrations of the sin-eater as that it would _"free [the defunct] from walking after they were dead"_ (which is presumably to say, the spirit of the departed would not then remain as some sort of ghost destined to walk the earth), one place we might look to for evidence of the sin-eater *not* having performed a role might be amongst those souls that were found to "walking" after death.

All Hallows Eve (or as we more commonly know it, Halloween, October 31st), the night before All Hallows Day, (November 1st, also known as All Saints Day, and which, in the Christian Church, is itself the day before the Feast of All Souls, November 2nd), is one of those nights on which the souls of the dead are often to be found walking.

So are there any traditions relaed to All Hallows Eve that might appear to be refelctions or echoes of the sin-eater tradition, or perhpas even parody the ritual of the sin-eater?

One in particular seems to jump out - that of *souling*, and the eating of *soul cake*. This tradition does not appear to be discussed within the context of the *sin-eater* tradition, but there are certain similarities that are perhaps worth noting, not just in in the lore of the tradition, but also the locations in which it seems to have been popular.

This chapter jumps out of time and reviews the traditions around *souling* and *soul cake* throughout the 19th century.
