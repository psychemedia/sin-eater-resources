It might be expected, that those who had such singular customs at the entrance on life, would have some peculiarities on the departure out of it. Previous to a funeral it is usual for the friends of the deceased to meet in the apartment where the corpse is placed ; some of them, generally the female part, kneel round it, and weeping bitterly, lament and bewail the loss of their departed friend. When it is brought to the door, one of the relations gives bread and cheese and beer over the coffin to some poor persons of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the dead, for collecting herbs and flowers to put into the coffin with the body ; some-times a loaf, with a piece of money stuck in it, is added. This done, all present kneel down, and the minister, if present, repeats the Lord’s Prayer. At every cross-way they stop, and the same ceremony is repeated, till they arrive at the church. Frequently the intervals are filled up by singing of psalms and hymns, which amidst the stillness of rural life, and the echo from the hills, produces a melancholy effect ; and adds to the sombre solemnity of the occasion.

A similar custom prevails in the Highlands, which they term *Coranich*. The bier is always carried by the next of kin, and this is considered as the highest mark of piety which can be paid to the departed relative. This, as we learn from Valerius Max. L. 7 , 1 , `[Metellus, the conqueror of Macedon, was borne to the funeral pile by his four sons. As a mark of respect, those who had deserved well of ihe commonwealth were carried by the Magistrates or Se- nators ; while persons hated by the people were carried by Vespil- lones or Sandapillones/kirelings for the purpose. To this custom Horace alludes — "Cadaver : Unctum oleo largo, midis humeris tulit hares." Lib. 2, S. 5. "Augustis ejecta cadavera cellis, Conservus vili portando locubat in area." Lib. i, S. 8. ]` was a usage among the Romans. If it happen in a morning or evening, the service is read accordingly. After the general thanksgiving, the minister goes to the communion-table, where he reads the two prayers which are usually, in other places, read at the grave; and then concludes with the prayer of St. Chrysostom and the Valete Grace. This done, he remains at the table till the nearest relation of the deceased comes up and deposits an Obituary Offering. If it be a person of consequence, the sum is a guinea or more ; if a farmer or tradesman, a crown; if a poor man, six-pence : the next of kin then follow the example, offering sometimes as much, and sometimes less than the first : the rest of the congregation, who intend to offer silver, follow, when a solemn pause ensues ; and the rest of the congregation offer pence : but pence are never offered at genteel funerals. The offerings on these occasions frequently amount to eight or ten pounds.`[Those of Caernarvon amount to little short of one hundred pounds per annum.]` This is certainly a relict of Popery, and was no doubt formerly intended as an acknowledgement to the priest for praying for the welfare of the departed soul ; as a composition for a short residence in purgatory; or perhaps for any failure in the payment of tythes and oblations, and is termed *Arian Rhiew*. Though still continued, it is now only considered as a small tribute of esteem to the memory of the deceased, and as a mark of attention to the resident clergy.

Another very singular custom, I never could learn the *rationale* of is, that of a man on new year's day, dressing himself in blankets and other trappings, with a factitious head like a horse, and a party attending him, knocking for admittance, this obtained, he runs about the room with an uncommon frightful noise, which the company quit in real or pretended fright ; they soon recover, and by reciting a verse of some ancient cowydd, or, in default, paying a small gratuity, they gain admission. A similar custom is prevalent in the Highlands ; (*Vid. Johnson*) and, from Du Cange, we find it was a practice of Heathenism. `[Ludi profani apud Ethnicos & Paganos solchant in Kalendis Januarii ; belluarum, pecudum, & Vetularum, assumptis formis, huc.]`
