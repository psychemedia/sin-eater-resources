# Second Controversy, 1895, Part II

With the editor of *The Times* apparently tiring of the sin-eater correspondence  by the end of October, it was perhaps "fortunate" that Mr Hartland had written to *The Academy* on October 14th, 1895, since it meant that when the letter appeared in edition dated [November 11th, 1895](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1895-11-09_48_1227/page/386/mode/2up?q=sin), p387-8, it would keep the debate alive.

As we are essentially looking back at Hartland's understanding of the matter from mid-October, there is an element of going back over ground already covered in the *Times* correspondence.

## Hartland's First Letter to The Academy, October-November, 1895: The Positive Evidence

In the opening paragraph, Hartland briefly reviews his comments to Captain Hinde's paper at the British Association meeting, and then admits to his being unaware at the time of the previous round of correspondence in *the Academy* twenty years earlier.

> CORRESPONDENCE. THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 14, 1895.
>
> During the recent discussion at the British Association meeting on cannibalism, I ventured to point out that there was reason to believe that the practice had once extended over a much wider area than we might be disposed a prior to think; and in support of my statement I referred, among other things, to the custom of Sin-eating, described by John Aubrey as existing in his time on the Welsh border and in Wales. This I explained as the relic of a more ancient custom of eating the corpse. My observations, when reported, called forth a letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, who, writing from Oswestry to the *Times*, absolutely denied the existence of the Sin-eater in Wales, declaring that "if the dissemination of false news is a crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a member of the Folklore Society," and calling my attention to the correspondence in the ACADEMY in the winter of 1875-76, in which Canon Silvan Evans, he seemed to think, had finally disposed of the evidence.

After obtaining the previous correspondence, albeit with some apparent difficulty, his position remains unaltered:

> As a matter of fact, I had to confess that I had not heard of that correspondence, and I found some difficulty in getting it. By the courtesy of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Woodall, I have now had the opportunity of reading it, and my opinion is unchanged by the perusal.

He then suggests that *The Academy* is perhaps the right and proper place to argue his case against both Mr Thomas, and Silvan Evans, the previous critic:

> As it may be desirable that the question should be thrashed out in the arena where the first blow was struck, and as, moreover, the Sin-eater furnishes meat lacking, perhaps, something of the savour most appetising for readers of a daily newspaper, I ask you to allow me to review the evidence in your columns.

He follows a strategy we also saw him use in his letter to the *Times* publisghed on October 14th, 1895, opening with the "positive" evidence, which is to say, the evidence he regards as supporting the claims of sin-eating in Wales. (From the signature at the end of the correspondence, the negative evidence he hopes to provide in a later letter.)

Not surprisingly, he opens with Aubrey:

> Before dealing with the negative evidence, let us see what positive evidence of the custom can be found. The stories, as Mr. Thomas says, all go back to Aubrey, who, we are told, is "none too strong a witness." It is true that the stories all go back to Aubrey, in the sense that he is the earliest writer to mention the custom, and that he gives the fullest account of it. He says (*Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme*, p. 35):
>
> "In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of Bread was brought out, and delivered to the sinne-eater over the corps, as also a mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the Defunct, aud freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead."

And then invokes Bagford, via Brand:

> In Brand and Ellis’s *Observations on Popular Antiquities* (ed. 1813, vol. ii., p. 155) is reprinted from Leland's *Collectanea* a letter from a Mr. Bagford, giving a slightly varied account, professedly derived from Aubrey, placing the scene of the custom in Shropshire, the time "within the memory of our fathers," and stating the fee paid to the Sin-eater as a groat. On this, if it stood alone in reference to Shropshire, I should lay no stress. It might contain the result of additional inquiries by Aubrey; it might, on the other hand, be only the inaccurate recollection of a verbal communication by him to Mr. Bagford, really referring to Herefordshire. If we compare it, however, with the cases cited further on, we shall have reason to think that the custom actually obtained in Shropshire.

As he commented elsewhere, he doesn't understand what Mr Thomas has against Aubrey:

> I do not know what grounds Mr. Thomas may have for casting doubt upon Aubrey's testimony. Aubrey was a careful and enlightened inquirer into old customs; he travelled about England and Wales with his eyes open; his *bona fides* is not to be questioned; and his description of the ceremony, and the expressions he makes use of, testify to his having something more as a foundation for his statements than casual gossip.

To reassert his support for Aubrey, Hartland quotes him again, arguing that Aubrey's account is not mis-representing the evidence in any way:

> A little lower down he adds:
>
> "This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed even in the strictest time of ye Presbyterian goverment: as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson of ye Parish, the relations of a woman deceased there had this Ceremonie punctually performed according to her will: and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this Countis: as also in Brecon, e.g. at Lllangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister could no hinder ye performing of this ancient custome."
>
> Aubrey does not, indeed, profess to have himself witnessed these  instances of the ceremony. If we depended entirely for evidence of events and customs on the affidavits of eye-witnesses, we should introduce a canon of evidence unknown to historical investigation, and should reject much that no reasonable man can doubt.

Hartland then argues, as he has before, that the tradition is well established, and traces of it are spread widely:

> Leaving for the moment what he says about Llangors, I pass to Derbyshire, a district where the Britons long maintained their independence, and the population of which is probably still to a great extent of Celtic ancestry. Recent inquiries by Mr. S. O. Addy have shown that
>
> "at a funeral in Derbyshire wine is first offered to the bearers who carry the corpse. This custom is strictly maintained, the guests not receiving any wive until the funeral party has returned from church... . When you drink wine at a funeral, every drop that you drink is a sin which the deceased has committed. You thereby take away the dead man's sins and bear them yourself" (*Household Tales, with other Traditional Remains, collected in the Counties of York, Lincoln, Derby, and Nottingham*, 1895, pp. 123, 124).

As we have seen previously, his claim is that such traditions are obviously a relic of an earlier, commonly held sin-eater tradition:

> This, there can hardly be a doubt, is a survival of a similar custom to that of the Sin-eater.

Hartland then pivots his argument:

> The same effect is assigned to the act of drinking; and the ritual requires that the wine should first be offered to certain of the funeral officials.

A long history of drinking traditions is then described, and a character Hartland did not allude to in his *Times* correspondence  – Monsieur Jorevin – and who has not explicitly appeared in any of the sin-eater descriptions to date, is introduced:

```{index} single: Jorevin, Monsieur
```
> Returning to Shropshire, we find a drinking custom recorded by an eye-witness in the reign of Charles II. M. Jorevin, apparently a Frenchman travelling in England, relates that he was present at a nobleman's funeral at Shrewsbury. The minister made a funeral oration to the assembled friends and relatives in the chamber where the body lay. "During the oration there stood upon the coffin a large Pot of Wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased." When this was finished the funeral proceeded. (Brand and Ellis, vol. ii., p. 153.) It is true that there is no special Sin-eater here, nor any words indicating the assumption by the survivors of the sins of the dead. But it will be observed that the health of the deceased can mean only "the ease and rest of the soul departed," which is exactly the expression placed in the Sin-eater's mouth by Mr. Bagford. The ceremony, in fact, looks uncommonly like that of Sin-eating transplanted to an upper stratum of society, and accompanied by modifications such as that transplantation would in course of time evolve.

Harltand then provides contemporary evidence of the tradition as provided to him by Gertrude Hope a couple of years previously:

> The same custom was still practised at Market Drayton as lately as July 1, 1893. Miss Gertrude Hope, writing in Folklore (vol. iv., p. 392), gives the particulars as related to her by an eye-witness. After the bearers had lunched, "the coffin was brought down and placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, and, the mourners having gathered round it," a short service was then and there conducted by the Nonconformist minister, as is frequently done, before setting out for the grave. "Directly the minister ended the woman in charge of the arrangements poured out four glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer present across the coffin, with a biscuit called a 'funeral biscuit.'" Mark what follows. "The minister, who had lately come from Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that he was sorry to see that pagan custom still observed. He had been able to put an end to it.in the Pembrokeshire village where he had formerly been." Here the food and drink were handed across the coffin to the bearers—the same officials who in Derbyshire first partake in a formal manner of the drink which is believed to have the effect of taking away the sins of the deceased. The relation of the ceremony to that of the Sin-eater is apparent. The evidence, if not literally at first hand, is such as cannot be doubted.

Reading the following paragraph today, we might read Harltand as admitting that Aubrey's claims are "merely" circumstantial, but Hartland is arguing perhaps that they are "substantively" circumstantial?

> If, fortified by this evidence from Derbyshire and the Marches, we turn to Wales, we find Aubrey’s statements of a very circumstantial character ; and that not merely in the case of Llangors referred to just now.

Hartland now uses sleight of hand again, suggesting that another quote from Aubrey is *also* demonstrative of the sin-eater tradition:

> Speaking of offertories at funerals, he says (*Remains*, p 23):
>
> "These are mentioned in the Rubrick of ye Ch. of Engl. Comon-Prayer booke: but I never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in Anglesey; but it is used over all the counties of North-Wales. But before when the corps is brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese and a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with ye Anno Dni ingraved on it, & ye parties name deceased, wich one accepts of on the other side of ye Corps, and this Custome is used to this day [1686] in North Wales."
>
> This is precisely the ceremony of Sin-eating, save that Aubrey does not record the words uttered. The testimony is perhaps all the stronger that he does not thus expressly connect it with a practice which he elsewhere declares he believed to have been "used over all Wales." It would seem that he had actually beheld it in this shape; though his words are not free from ambiguity.

Hartland then reaffirms his belief in the efficacy of Aubrey's researches, invoking Pennant as another commentator of upon the same tradition:

> At all events, it is clear that he had made minute inquiries. A century later Pennant describes the same custom among several others "used among us in former times, which have been gradually dropped in —— as the age grew enlightened." He says:
>
> "Previous to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister or daughter (for it must be a female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they presented, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and required the person to drink alittle of it immediately. When that was done, they kneeled down, and the minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer; after which, they proceeded with the corpse (*Tours in Wales*", ed. 1883, vol. iii., p. 150).

Pennant's credentials are also assumed to be good ones:

> Pennant was born and lived in Wales; and we must suppose that he is describing what he was perfectly familiar with by the reports of his neighbours and friends, if he had not himself witnessed it.

For Hartland, then, contemporary evidence of certain food traditions claimed as remnants of sin-eating is seen to resemble the earlier evidence of Aubrey and Pennant, and hence they must also be seen as evidence of sin-eating:

> The explicit statements of Aubrey and Pennant must be put side by side with the evidence already given of the minister at Market Drayton, that the custom had survived to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And, since all the acts of the ceremony were identical with those of the Sin-eater, and only the ritual words were wanting, they prepare us to believe Mr. Matthew Moggridge when he reports that words and all were used at Llandebie, a few miles from Swansea, down to a few years before 1852, when he read a paper on the subject at Ludlow to the Cambrian Archaeological Association. It is unnecessary to quote the paper, which is to be read in *Archaeologia Cambrensis* (vol. iii., N.S., p. 330), as it mentions no material variation of the ceremony. The omission of the ritual words is to be accounted for by the presence of the clergy, who would doubtless regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as Aubrey tells us, found the rite too deeply rooted to be successfully prohibited; but in deference to them, it is probable that a compromise would be adopted. The acts would continue to be performed, the words interpreting and completing those acts would be dropped.

The logic of this argument is rather perverse:

- there is a sin-eater tradition, as defined by Aubrey;
- Aubrey described certain ritual behaviours;
- Pennant described certain ritual behaviour;
- contemporary ritual behavious have been observed;
- they're all the same;
- they are claimed to be remnants of sin-eating;
- therefore, sin-eating exists.

Whatever the case, Hartland considered his case in support of his claims complete. For the "negative" evidence, the readers of the *Academy* would have to wait until a later issue: 

> I will ask permission to consider the negative evidence in another letter.

## Hartland's Second Letter to The Academy, October-November, 1895: The Negative Evidence

Hartland's second letter to the *Academy*, dated October 25th, 1895, a Friday, was published on November 16th, 1895, in [Vol 48 Iss 1228, p413-4](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1895-11-16_48_1228/page/412/mode/2up?q=sin). It was perhaps unfortunate that it presumably posted two or three days before a replay from Mr. Thomas had appeared in *The Times* dated Monday, October 28th, 1895.

The letter opens with a reference to the "a MS. book of a Bisop of St. Asaph", which is perhaps the manuscript that was reprinted in [Vol 2 Iss 6](ARCHC:manuscript) of *Archaologia Cambrensis*, dated April, 1885?

> THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> II.
>
> Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 25, 1895.
>
> Before I examine the negative evidence, let me revert for a moment to Pennant’s statement cited in my previous letter. I am indebted to Mr. J. P. Owen, who, writing lately to Prof. Rhys, has pointed out that this statement is derived from the same source as an account of "Ancient Usages and Customs in North Wales," contained in the *British Magazine* for April, 1835 (vol. vii., p. 399), and there said to be "from a MS. book of a Bishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago." The British Magazine is now lying before me, and the passage runs as follows:
>
> "When the corpse is brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, and covered before it be taken up, the next of kin to the deceased —widow, mother, daughter, or cousin (never done by a man)— gives cross over the corpse to one of the poorest neighbours two or three white loaves of bread and a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will require the poor body that receives it immediately to drink a little of. When this is done, the minister (if present) saith the Lord's prayer, and then they set forward towards church."

Hartland obviously regards this as a manuscript that Pennant referenced, rather than a manuscript of Pennant's own work:

> The way in which Pennant deals with the entire account, omitting or varying some usages and inserting others, suggests that, though he unquestionably had the MS. or a copy of it before him, he supplemented or varied it in accordance with information obtained elsewhere. In the passage I have quoted I would draw attention, for example, to his graphic touches the loaves as presented "in a great dish," and bringing the funeral party before us as kneeling down when the Lord’s Prayer was repeated, which are not to be found in the *British Magazine*. Perhaps the omissions may be equally significant, but naturally they are less to be trusted. The whole account should, however, be compared, for doing which I have no space here. In any case, the detail of "a new wooden cup," overlooked or purposely left out by Pennant, is worth noting as an independent confirmation of Aubrey some half century after he wrote.

Hartland now turns to the main focus of his epistle, the "negative evidence" that could be directed aganst the claims of the sin-eater's existence in Wales. The list of points is identical to the numbered list he included in the letter to the *Times* of October 14th, 1895:

> Now, what is the negative evidence? It amounts to this :
>
> 1. Canon Silvan Evans himself, though accustomed from his profession to attend funerals, and though interested in folk-lore, never found a trace of the custom; nor has he found it mentioned in Welsh literature.
>
> 2. He made inquiries in the year 1875 of the Vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr. Rowland, the schoolmaster, denied the existence of — practice in that parish. An intelligent octogenarian in the parish, of whom the vicar inquired, also denied it.
>
> 3. The Rev. T. Eynon Davies also denied it ia reference to Cwmamman, founding his denial not merely upon his own experience (not a very long one in 1882), but also upon the declarations of octogenarians.

The next paragraph covers much the same ground as the earlier letter to *the Times*, although in more detail.

> None of these denials, nor all of them together, can outweigh the positive evidence of Aubrey, Pennant, and the minister at Market Drayton. Even if we assume, what I do not see my way at present to admit, namely, that Pennant was merely reproducing the statement of the Bishop of St. Asaph (or whoever may have been the writer of his MS.), it is clear that the latter was describing the custom as still subsisting when he wrote. Thus, the custom that certainly existed uncurtailed in the seventeenth century at Llangors maintained itself, shorn of the ritual words, well into the eighteenth century in North Wales, and down to a few years ago in Pembrokeshire. We may be sure it did not maintain itself only in these places. I do not understand that Canon Silvan Evans's denials extend to England. But to admit the existence of the practices (and they can hardly be denied) in Shropshire and Derbyshire is to lend strong countenance to the probability of similar practices in many districts of Wales. Mr. Matthew Moggridge did not claim to have been an eye-witness — we cannot even affirm that he saw and examined eye-witnesses; but it is possible, and even likely, that he did, seeing that he lived at Swansea, only twelve or thirteen miles from Llandebie. His assertions. at any rate, were evidently not made at random, but were the result of investigations. He may have been misled. So may Aubrey and the writer of the Bishop of St. Asaph's MS. In that event it is remarkable that the accounts they give, while agreeing in the main, present just the differences we might expect from independent writers describing a custom liable to all the variations of traditional practice. Nor will the hypothesis that these writers were misled get rid of the evidence of the minister at Market Drayton. He at least could not have been mistaken about a custom which he had himself succeeded in putting down.

The opening sentence of the next paragraph again repeats the letter to *the Times*
> It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans's inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot until more than a quarter of a century after the alleged event. The lapse of time must affect the value of his negative results. More than this, however. His inquiries were made through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. The latter, indeed, was, we are told, an old resident ; but the clergyman had only been vicar for fourteen years, though he described himself as having known the neighbourhood well for twenty-five years, which may mean much or little. We have no means of knowing in what form these gentlemen in turn put their questions. That may make all the difference. In any case, they are precisely the persons who would not be likely to discover the superstition if it existed. The Rev. Elias Owen, diocesan inspector of schools, and one of the chief authorities on Welsh folk-lore, relates that once, being in a certain parish for the purpose of examining the school, he took the opportunity of asking the clergyman concerning the superstitions of the place, when he was met by the dignified repulse, "*Our* people are not superstitious, I am glad to say." His inspection over, he asked the first class, "Now, children, can you tell me of any place where there is a *buggan* (ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of anyone who has seen one?" Instantly every hand was stretched out, and every child had a story to tell. The fact is, the people hide their superstitions from all such representatives of modern culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and it is by no means an uncommon experience that the existence of matters of the kind perfectly well-known to the peasant is stoutly denied by that same peasant to the clergyman when he asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest, who has in the confessional a weapon much more powerful than the Anglican, is often baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev. C. F. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before the magistrates on the Clonmel "Witch-burning" inquiry, is of the greatest weight on this point.

The next point did not appear in the *Times* letter:

> He said he had heard "nothing, absolutely nothing," of the doings which ended in the unfortunate victim’s death, until all was over. Asked if he did not think that very extraordinary, he replied :
>
> "No, I do not. The priest is very often the last to hear of things like that—generally, I should say... I had no suspicion of foul play or witchcraft, and if I had 1 should have at once absolutely refused to say mass in the house, and have given information to the police at once."

But then we rejoin the orginal letter:

> The reason of the concealment from the priest or the minister comes out here. It is founded on the known hostility of such personages to the ancient superstitions.

The final paragraph is newly written, and suggests that there is more to come:

> So far, then, as regards the actual practice of Sin-eating in Wales in modern times, it must be said, with all respect to Canon Silvan Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are recognised by everyone), that his denials and the results of his inquiries do not countervail the positive evidence; and the same remark applies with even greater force to the Rev. Eynon Davies, whose inquiries were made later still. But in order to complete the case, I must add something as to Canon Evans’s failure to find any allusion to the Sin-eater in Welsh literature. This, however, I shall have to reserve for next week.
>
> E. SIDNEY HARTLAND.

Before that letter was to appear, however, another report of another, possibly related, custom made its way into the pages of *Bye-Gones* dated [November 20th, 1895, p218](https://journals.library.wales/view/2092910/2098365/8#?xywh=-1536%2C-465%2C5820%2C3838):

> THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> I do not know whether the following will throw any light on the question of "The Sin-Eater in Wales," which has again come up for discussion :— A few months ago, six or so, I was present at the funeral of a member of one of the old-inhabitant families of Bettws-Cedewain. After the corpse was placed outside the door, and before the performance of the religious service, a small piece of cake was given, first to the bearers (but whether across the corpse or not I cannot now recollect),and afterwards to each of the guests. Next a glass of wine was handed to each one in the same order. I believe the custom was general in this district twenty or thirty years ago, but I have seen only one other instance of its observance within the last five years. I have never heard any ritual used.

## Hartland's Third Letter to The Academy, November, 1895: The Lack of Mentions in Welsh Literature

Harltand's third contribution to the *Academy*, dated November 4th, 1895, appeared in [Vol 48 Iss 1229, p435](https://archive.org/details/sim_academy-and-literature_1895-11-23_48_1229/mode/2up?q=sin+eater), published on November 23rd, 1895.

> CORRESPONDENCE. THE SIN-EATER IN WALES.
>
> III.
>
> Highgarth, Gloucester: Nov. 4, 1895.
>
> I have now dealt with the positive evidence derived from English sources— that is to say, from writings in the English language— and with the negative evidence of the inquiries by Canon Silvan Evans at Llandebie and by the Rev. Eynon Davies at Cwmamman, and of the general acquaintance of the former with Welsh folk-lore.

The main subject of this letter is the question of the appearance, or rather, the lack of it, of the sin-eater in Welsh literature.

At this point, Hartland admits he is perhaps not the best qualified person to scour the pages of historical Welsh texts, not being a native Welsh speaker (we might also comment, his scholarshiop appears to be lacking across English journals too!). He also wonders how many English customs might exist *in practice* if not in books?

> But Canon Evans not only failed to trace the Sin-eater in Welsh folk-lore; he failed also to trace him in Welsh literature. Here he has me at a disadvantage. I am not conversant, as he is, with Welsh literature. I do not doubt, however, that many English customs have existed, and perhaps exist even yet, of which no indication can be found in ordinary English literature; and it may be the same in Wales.

I'm not sure what tone of voice Hartland had in mind as he suggested that Silvan Evans, despite being a noted philologist, should perhaps hecked the dictionary? (Was he aware, I wonder, that Silvan Evans had also embarked on various Welsh dictionary projects?)

> But I should like to ask: what has he looked for, and how has he looked for it? He is himself a lexicographer of distinction ; and he is doubtless acquainted with the work of his predecessor, Owen Pughe. If he will turn to the letter D he will find the word *Diawdlestr* thus defined: "A drinking cup, also a cup full of drink so-called, superstitiously given for the dead, which in some places is called *diawdlyst*, and *cwpan y meirw*"; and *Diawdlyst* is explained as "The give-ale."

At this point, Hartland admits it wasn't he himself who had made this discovery:

> I owe this reference to Mr. Owen. Prof. Rhys has been kind enough to make a little further search. He has turned up in Thomas Richards's *Welsh and English Dictionary* (Trefriw, 1815) what seems to be one form, if not the original and true form, of Pughes’s *Diawdlyst*, namely *Diodlifft*, explained by *Cwppan dros y meirw* (a cup for, or on behalf of, the dead), with a reference to "Davies." The reference to Davies seems to be not to Davies's still older Welsh Dictionary, but rather to his "MS. notes." We have here at least three words expressive of a cup of drink superstitiously given for the dead, pointing not to an isolated, but to a widely known custom of some kind.

Whatever the case, Hartland suggest this proves the existence of the sin-eater in Welsh literature:

> To what can they point, if not to the practices detailed in my first letter and in the extract from the Bishop of St. Aseph's MS, ? And that they do in fact refer to hem there is proof in Welsh literature.

But apparently, there's more:

> *Cymru Fu* is a little book published anonymously at Wrexham, bearing no date on the title-page, but having the preface dated 1862. It is a sort of *omnium gatherum* of Welsh history, literature, and traditions. Among other things, it contains an account of popular funeral customs. The portion (p. 91) which is pertinent to my present purpose, runs as follows :
>
> "Before the sad procession started for the church the friends and nearest relations collected about the corpse to bewail and lament their loss, while the rest of the company were in another room drinking warm beer and smoking their pipes, and the women in another room still were drinking tea together. After the coffin was carried out of the house and laid on the bier beside the door, one of the relations of the deceased gave bread and cheese over the coffin to poor people, who, in expectation of these gifts, had been diligently gathering flowers and herbs to bestow in the coffin. Sometimes a loaf of bread with a piece of mone stuck in it was added to these [gifts]. Then all the mourners knelt down, and the clergyman, if present, repeated the Lord's Prayer, and the procession stopped and repeated the same prayer at every cross-way until they reached the church."

At this point, Hartland admits the *Cymru Fu* author must have had access to Pennant, but he also suggests that he must have access to other texts too that had provided an additional source of facts:

> I think it is undeniable that the writer had Pennant before him while writing this passage ; and I have purposely translated it so as to bring out the identities of expression. But allowing for this, it is clear that he has other sources of information from which he adds particulars given neither by Pennant nor in the Bishop of St. Asaph's MS. Such are the description of the proceedings before the corpse was taken out of the house, and the details of where the coffin was placed outside the house (*gerllaw y drws*), and of the presentation of flowers and herbs in return for the bread and cheese.

There is no suggestion of poetic license or creative input on the part of the author.

Hartland does not, however, feel the need to rely on so recent a text as *Cymru Fu*, for he also draws on *Drych y Amseroedd*, which we might recall was referenced in correspondence in the November 14th, 1895, edition of *Y Cymro*:

> Scepticism, however, may deny the authority of so modern a compilation as *Cymru Fu*. Let me, therefore, turn to an account of the same custom, written at least forty years earlier. It occurs in a little book called *Drych y Amseroedd* [Wikipedia](https://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drych_yr_Amseroedd) [book](https://viewer.library.wales/4794349). The purport of the book is described in the title-page, which may be rendered : "Mirror of the Times; comprising a little of the history of the most remarkable things that have happened, chiefly in Gwynedd, during the last two centuries in relation to religion. In the form of a conversation between Inquisitive and Observer."

Hartland brings the attention of the predominantly English speaking *Academy* audience to the same exceprt from that work in the following way:

> Its author was a Calvinistic Methodist minister, named Robert Jones, of Capel y Dinas, previously of Rhoslan; and it was published at Llanrwst, presumably in 1820, for that is the date of the preface, though there is none on the title-page to the second edition, to which alone I have access. In the course of the conversation, Inquisitive says (p. 50) :—
>
> "I remember hearing my grandfather talk about something called *Dïodas* or *Dïodles*. Can you tell me what it was ?" And Observer replies :
>
> "When someone happened to die in a family, a certain poor man was chosen by the family to have the favour of receiving that happy charity, the *dïodles*. The manner of giving it to the poor man was this: the family sent to the workman who made the coffin a cup to be coloured the same colour as the coffin. Two colours were customary for coffins at that time: black for the coffins of married, and white for those of unmarried persons. When the day of the funeral came, after putting the corpse on the bier, the head of the house presented the superstitious alms to the poor man— namely, a large loaf of good bread, an ample piece of cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, and the coloured cup full of beer, if there was any, or else of milk, reaching them over the corpse to the poor man. He in return blessed and prayed fervently and earnestly with the dead man's soul [*gyd dg enaid y marw*]."

*It might be useful here to compare the translation given above, presumably made by a native Welsh speaker, with the machine translation we obtained of the original Y Cymro text.*

Hartland admits to some difficulty in clarifying the content of last sentence, but is not concerned by any possible mis-representation of it:

> The last sentence is one of some difficulty. But, whatever the true rendering, it cannot denied that we have in the custom described a practice of giving a cup full of drink for, or on behalf of, the dead. The bread, cheese, and money are of course given for the same purpose; and prayers and blessings of no ordinary kind are expected and given in return.

Hartland then co-opts the practice as akin to the one described by Aubrey and asks what Mr Thomas or Canon Silvan Evans have to say, *the that! Harrumph...*

> If this be not a local variant of the practice delineated by Aubrey — a variant, moreover, affected by the natural ceremonial decay of, say, two more generations — perhaps Canon Silvan Evans or Mr. Thomas will have the goodness to tell us what it is, or how he would propose to discredit the witness.

At this point, it's not hard to imagine Hartland pacing around his office, gesticulating enthusiastically, and pronouncing to an imaginary jury...

In passing, I note a notice in *The Times* of Monday,  August 12th, 1878, p14, that suggests that Mr Hartland was at one time a lawyer in the province:

> PURSUANT to an Order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Diviason, made in an Action in the Matter of the Estate of William Harris Roberts deceased Williams and others aginst Davies and another 1878, R. 83 The CREDITORS of WILLIAM HARRIS ROBERTS late of 21 Singleton Terrace, Swansea in the county of Glamorgan.

> Until then I shall hold, as I think most of the readers of these letters will hold, that it is strong and independent confirmation of the existence of the custom of sin-eating, or, what is the same thing, of sin-drinking in Wales.

There can be no doubt in the verdict... But how did it ever come to this?!

> How is it, then, that Canon Silvan Evans has been unable to trace it in Welsh literature? The explanation lies, I believe, in his having looked for a functionary called the Sin-eater, and for a Welsh form of the word "sin-eater," while students of tradition would look for the custom.

Ah, he was looking for the wrong thing...

> He has missed the substance in seeking for the shadow. And yet I think I have shown that even the search for the shadow need not have been in vain.

And he also omitted to look for words that describe, not the tradition, but practices claimed to to be associated with the tradition:

> There are, at least, four words in the language expressive of the custom, or of the cup with which it was performed: *Cwpan y meirw*, the cup of the dead; *Diawdlestr* or *Diodlestr*, the cup of drink superstitiously given for the dead; *Diodlifft*, which Prof. Rhys suggests to me, is, perhaps, partly an English loan-word, meaning the drink lifted over the dead; and, lastly, the *Dïodles*, the Venedotian word for the custom, meaning possibly the drink-boon.

But then: what can you expect? Great lexicographer he may be, but he only knows his A, B, C...

> Canon Evans's great dictionary has not yet progressed beyond the letter C. I do not know why he has omitted *Cwpan y meirw* from it: no doubt not without some reason. When he publishes D he will have an opportunity of explaining the other three words, and incidentally of telling us why he passed over the curious *Cwpan y meirw*.

Or not!

Hartland now brings his case to close, summarises the main points, and addressing the jury once again:

> I have now shown, by examination both of the positive and of the negative evidence, that there is abundant ground for believing in the existence of the custom of sin-eating in Wales. I have shown it in the Marches down to the year 1893; I have shown it in Brecknockshire in the seventeenth century; I have shown it in Pembrokeshire down to recent years ; I have shown it in Powisland in the eighteenth century; I have shown that in Gwynedd, or the western part of North Wales, it had not died out of memory in the year 1820, though probably it was no longer practised.

The argument, he claims, cannot be denied, even if you discount Aubrey:

> The united force of the testimony I have adduced— concurrent, be it remembered, in its main lines, and not diverging in detail more than we might reasonably expect from the differences of locality and of time—is very great; nor can it be set aside by pooh-poohing Aubrey.

And there is also lots of other evidence, probably, even if no-one has found it:

> I might have adduced other English evidence ; and where Canon Silvan Evans has failed to find evidence lying upon the surface of Welsh literature—nay, in his very path as a philologist — it is not impossible that careful inquiry may discover further references to the custom. Even as the matter stands, however, it is amply proved. I have dealt with its meaning in the second volume of my *Legend of Perseus*, lately published by Mr. David Nutt, and have there traced parallel practices over a large part of Europe, and, indeed, of the world. Here I will only add that I believe it to be an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity, originating probably in the custom, expressly ascribed by Strabo to the Irish, of the eating of dead parents.

He then closes with a sop to Mr Thomas, that the original (cannibalistic) practive may well have derived from the Irish rather than the Welsh:

> If so, Mr. Thomas may derive some comfort from the conjecture that after all the custom properly belongs rather to the Goidelic, than to the Cymric branch of the Celtic race. Upon this speculation it is not my business to enter.

A few days later, the *South Wales Daily News* of [November 27th 1895, p4](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3735936/3735940/29/) relayed the latest installment of the debate to a wider Welsh public in an article that also appeared in the *Cambrian* of [December 12thm 1895, p7](https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3341162/3341169/65/):

> Welsh Gossip

> The alleged existence of the sin-eater in Wales has occasioned an interesting discussion in the *Academy*, to which Mr E. Sidney Hartland has just contributed a series of three articles dealing with the positive and negative evidence on the question. Canon Silvan Evans, the eminent Welsh lexicographer, declares he has failed to trace the sin-eater either in Welsh folklore or in Welsh literature. Mr Sidney Hartland this week, however, quotes interesting extracts from *Cymru Fu* and *Drych yr Amseroedd* in support of his view that "there is abundant ground for believing in the existence of the custom of sin-eating in Wales;" and in concluding his article he thus sums up :— "I have shown it in the Marches down to the year 1893 I have shown it in Brecknockshire in the seventeenth century I have shown it in Pembrokeshire down to recent years I have shown it in Powisland in the eighteenth century I have shown that in Gwynedd, or the western part of North Wales, it had not died out of memory in the year 1820, though probably it was no longer practised... Where Canon Silvan Evans has failed to find evidence lying upon the surface of Welsh literature— nay, in his very path as a philologist— it is not impossible that careful inquiry may discover further references to the custom. Even as the matter stands, however, it is amply proved." Mr Hartland believes the custom to be an interesting relic of immemorial antiquity, originating probably in the custom, expressly ascribed by Strabo to the Irish, of the eating of dead parents; but he adds a grain of comfort in the conjecture that, after all, the custom properly belongs rather to the Goidelic than to the Cymric branch of the Celtic race.
