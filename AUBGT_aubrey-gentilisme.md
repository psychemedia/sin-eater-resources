Preface

The RemaineSj while containing much of value, are not of equal merit throughout. Aubrey had the faculty of collection rather than that of selection, and he was clearly inclined to be credulous, and thought to be so by some of his most noteworthy contemporaries. The great naturalist John Ray, for example, expresses himself plainly on this head in a letter printed by Aubrey in the Natural JSistory and Antiquities of Surrey (v. 410). He says : —
" I think (if you can give me leave to be free with you) that you are a little too inclinable to credit strange relations. I have found men that are not skilful in the history of nature very credulous, and apt to impose upon themselves and others, and therefore dare not give a firm assent to anything they report upon their own authority, but are ever suspicious that they may either be deceived themselves, or delight to teratologize (pardon the word), and to make show of knowing strange things.'-
In the same work, however (iv. 407, Appendix), Aubrey gives the following justification of his con- duct : —
'' It may seem nauseous to some that I have raked up so many old western proverbs, which I confess I disdain not to quote. Pliny himself being not afraid to call them oracles, lib. 18, cap. 4: ^Ac primum omnium oraculis majore ex parte agemus, quae non in alio vitae genere plura certiorave sunt.' For pro- verbs are drawn from the experience and observation of many ages, and are the ancient natural philosophy
of the vulgar, preserved in old English and Norse rhymes handed down to us, and which I set as instantiae crucis, for our curious modem philosophers to examine, and give 810X19 to their 'OXt?."
At the present day, whatever we may think of Aubrey's credulity, all folk-lorists are glad that he did not " disdain to quote " the proverbs, sayings, and traditions of the people.

Sinne Eaters [p. 33]

Jam tamen extincto cineri sua dona ferebant;
Compositiq' nepos busta piebat avi. — [F. t. 425-6]
Signaq' dat digitis medio cum pollice junctis;
Occurrat tacito ne levis umbra sibi. Terq' manus puras fontana perluit unda;
Vertitur, et nigras accipit ore fabas.
Aversusq' jaci: sed dum jacit, Haec ego mitto;
His, inquit, redimo meq' meosq' fabis.
Hoc novies dicit, nec respicit: umbra putatur
Colligere, et nullo terga vidente sequi.— .[F. t. 433-440.]

Google Translate:

But when the ashes had already been extinguished, they were carrying their own gifts;
The grandson of Composiq' pity the tombs of his grandfather. [F. t. 425-6]
He gives the signs and the middle fingers with the thumbs joined together;
Let him come across in silence, lest a slight shadow come to him. The spring-water washes the pure hands thrice;
He turns, and gets black beans in his mouth.
To be cast away from him: but while he casts, These things I send;
With these, he says, I buy off my beans.
He says this nine times, and does not look back; the shadow is supposed to
To collect, and to follow with no rear sight.

Sinne-eaters*  p24


It seems a remainder of this custom which lately obtained at Amersden, in the county of Oxford, where at the burial of every corps one cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment were brought to the minister in the Ch. porch. W. K.

Sinne-'eaters. [See pp. 18, 22.]
p35-6

In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to hire/have
poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of bread was brought 
out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a 
Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to 
drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scape-goate in ye old Lawe. Leviticus, cap. xvi. verse 21, 22. "And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goate and confesse over him all yw iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fitt man into the wildemesse. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let the goat goe into the wildemesse." This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some people was observed/continued even on the strictest time of ye Presbyterian goverment: as at Dynder, volens noelens the Parson of ye Parish, the kinred/relations of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in this Countie ; as also in Brecon, e, g. at Llangors, where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye 
performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custome was 
heretofore used over all Wales. 

See Juvenal Satyr, vi. [519-521,] where he speakes of throwing purple thread into y® river to carry away ones sinne.

In North-Wales, the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of; but there, insted of a Bowie of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke. 

Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have some resemblance of that of ye Sinne-eater. Doles at Funeralls 
were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England 
till the Civil- warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good Beer. — Cramer.
