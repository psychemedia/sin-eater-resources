IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION. 

*To the Editors of the Archeologia Cambrensis.*

GENTLEMEN,— I take the liberty of addressing you, not only as being one of your constant readers, but as being deputed by several of your friends and brother antiquaries to communicate to you our opinion upon a matter of no small interest to the common cause we advocate, — the study and preserva-tion of the National Antiquities of Wales.

In the first place I should observe, that we highly approve of the efforts made by yourselves and the contributors to the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, towards exciting and extending a love and knowledge of Cambrian Archeaology; and we make no doubt but that your efforts will, in the course of time, produce an excellent effect upon the whole body of Welsh antiquaries, as well as upon the public in general. We consider as a token of this, the great variety of communications concerning Wales which your pages have received, not only from correspondents within the Principality, but also from those in other parts of Great Britain, and even from the sister island. The value, too, of nearly all the papers you have printed, and the highly interesting information which your Work has been the means of divulging, show that the subject of Welsh antiquities is not merely as rich as you yourselves apparently anticipated it to be, but, we expect, will prove to be much more extensive and important, in a national and historical point of view, than the majority of British antiquaries are inclined to admit. We also would remind the archeological world, through your pages, that the correspondence, which you have published shows how warm an interest is taken in antiquarian subjects in places, where the very existence of such a feeling has been strongly denied ; and, were we called on for a proof of this, would appeal to Caernarvon as a remarkable instance; where to our knowledge several amateurs, and even indifferent persons, have been *bitten* with the antiquarian *furor*, and where a strong desire to cultivate the study of national antiquities now happily prevails. Your publication is entitled to much praise for having encouraged and concentrated this good feeling in that town; and we doubt not but that similar results have occurred, or may be expected, at other places.

Next, we consider that the existence of a publication like your own, appearing at stated intervals, and making periodical additions to our stock of antiquarian knowledge, as well as appealing to our better feelings for the preservation of the existing monuments of Wales, is a positive good for the Principality, inasmuch as it gives us a common vehicle of communication, and tends to keep up that feeling of good will, which should ever prevail among men engaged in the same noble pursuit. We are convinced of the truth of the observation made by one of your contributors, that as antiquaries, we need some centre of communication, some kind of organization, so that we may act the more efficaciously by combining our common efforts, and by imparting to each other quickly and surely our mutual discoveries and opinions. Until the appearance of the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* we could hardly be said to have had any general antiquarian periodical, unless the *Transactions of the Cymmrodorion Society* be considered as such. Your Work, however, by coming out at short and regular intervals, and by treating the subject in a spirited manner, has excited the attention of most of the antiquaries of Wales, and, we are sure, has been approved of by a considerable majority of them.

While discussing subjects of this kind, and in pursuing a similar course of reasoning, we antiquaries have said amongst ourselves, why not carry out the principle of the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* still further? If it really is useful to us as an organ of communication, and as "a bond of union," (I think you called it so in the prospectus which you circulated, before it appeared,) why not take steps for making this co-operation of Welsh antiquaries still more effective? We do not doubt, Gentlemen, your full anxiety and determination to labour in the cause of national archaeology, but we feel inclined to lend you a helping hand, and we wish to propose to do so in a manner that we think you will be the first to approve of.

Since so much good has been effected throughout England, generally, by the existence of Societies for "the Encouragement and Promotion of researches into the Arts and Monuments of the Early and Middle Ages," and since the enthusiasm excited by these societies is still on the increase, why should we not establish a similar Society or Association for Wales, and form ourselves into a body of Archeologists for the Study and Preservation of Welsh National Antiquities?

We are aware that some will urge against the idea, what they are pleased to call, our national apathy and slowness. They will say that other Welsh societies have been formed with not very dissimilar objects, and have become extinct, or else proceed so slowly that their existence is scarcely known to the generality of our fellow countrymen. But we would reply, that Archaeology is not now the dry and dusty, because speculative and theoretical, study which it once was. It is like Geology, it has taken firm hold of the national mind, and has numerous votaries in all parts, not of these islands only, but of the whole civilized world. The same objection, too, might have been urged against the formation of any new association in England ; for was not the old Society of Antiquaries already in existence when the others were formed? and yet, by which is the real work now principally doing, by the society at Somerset House, or by the others? But we have another and a better argument than these ; just as on the appearance of the *Archaeological Journal*, published by the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, and the *Journal of the British Archaeological Association*, which is the organ of the other Society, these publications caused the existence of a body of readers more than three thousand in number, —nearly all of whom are also members of one or other of those two societies, — so, the purchasers of the *Archaeologia Cambrensis* are of themselves quite numerous enough to form a very efficient Antiquarian Society, or, at least, to constitute the nucleus of one for North and South Wales.


The Undersigned

Name       Address

*approve of the formation of a Society for the Study and Preservation of Welsh National Antiquities.*

Cut this slip out, fill it up, and forward it, post paid, to the Editors of the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, care of Mr. PICKERING, 177, Piccadilly, London.

On the advantage of forming such a body we need not dwell, since your pages have already borne testimony to it; but we would only hint at two perils to be avoided. First, the danger of inactivity and desuetude, which creep fatally upon all associations at one time or other of their existence ; and next, the danger of quarrels and rivalries springing up amongst the members, as we see to have been the case amongst our friends in England. However, Dr. Johnson, some where or other, has remarked, that "Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible difficulties must first be overcome ;" and, as this seems to be a good practical aphorism, we have adopted it, and, therefore, having consulted together, we beg to propose to you, and through your medium to our friends and brother antiquaries, the following scheme:—

That an Antiquarian Association be formed, to be called "The Cambrian Archeological Association for the study and preservation of the National Antiquities of Wales."

That it be a perfectly *gratuitous* Society, consisting of all persons whose taste and knowledge may induce them to unite for this purpose.

That the most eminent Welsh antiquaries and other personages, the natural friends and protectors of the antiquities of the country, be requested to put themelves at the head of this Society.

That a Council, with a President, Secretary, and other officers be appointed ; and that a code of regulations be framed, by common consent, for the guidance and government of the Society.

That whatever incidental expenses may arise, be left to be defrayed by the good feeling of those patrons of antiquarian pursuits who may be generous enough to come forward for that purpose.

And, lastly, that the *Archceologia Cambrensis* be adopted as the official organ of the Society.

These propositions and hints, which are thrown out for the consideration of your readers and yourselves, we have no hesitation in saying, could be carried into effect quickly, easily, and at a very trifling expense. We re- quest you to turn the subject over in your minds, and to propose it for the consideration of your readers. —
I remain yours faithfully,

London 1st June, 1846.

A WELSH ANTIQUARIAN

The editors then replied directly with the following statement:

TO OUR READERS.

We confess that, on reading the above, we feel not a little gratified at witnessing so much enthusiasm as is evinced by this writer in, what we cannot but style, "the good cause." We beg leave also to return our best thanks to him and to our antiquarian friends, for their very flattering opinion of the merits, if there be any, of our humble endeavours. That such good results have been produced is owing, not to the Editors of the (Archaologia Cambrensis), but to the circumstance of the mine which they have ventured to drive a level into, turning out to be so much richer in archeological ore than some could be brought to believe. Our sole object in publishing this Work, at a very considerable sacrifice of time and money, has been to awakey a love of antiquities among our fellow countrymen; and we are quite ready to do any thing within the compass of our limited abilities for the furtherance of the common good. We have given the proposal of our correspondent our best consideration, and have taken the opinion of some judicious friends upon it. The idea coincides with our own wishes; and we therefore venture to offer to our readers the following plan for ascertaining the general feeling of Welsh antiquaries upon this matter.

We request all those, into whose hands these pages may fall, to have the goodness to discuss the matter with their antiquarian friends; and then to take the trouble to communicate their opinions upon it to us through the medium of the publisher. Letters addressed to the *Editors of the Archaeologia Cambrensis*, to the care of Mr. Pickering, 177, Piccadilly, will be put into our hands immediately, and will meet with prompt attention. For the convenience, however, of those who may wish simply to declare their approval of the plan in question, or of some such scheme, the particulars of which can be more fully explained when the sense of the Welsh antiquarian public shall be thus ascertained, we append a printed form, which (without pledging themselves to any thing) they have merely to fill up, with the names and addresses of themselves and of their friends, who may think favourably of the idea, and then transmit it to us, directed as above.

We have only to add, that the sooner we are put in possession of the opinions of our friends and supporters on this subject, the greater facility shall we have of communicating with persons of influence, and of obtaining their aid to organize such a Society, if its formation be deemed desirable.

THE PROPOSED CAMBRIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION.

We are now in a position to lay before our readers a List of names of those friends and patrons of Antiquarian pursuits, who have sent in to us their written approvals of the scheme proposed by one of our correspondents, (No. III. pp. 281, et sequent.) It will be seen that among them are comprised many of the most active of our Cambrian Antiquaries; and, we are happy to be able to state, that the reception they have given to the idea, started by one of their brethren has been exceedingly favourable. In addition to these gentlemen, we have received verbal assurances of support and encouragement, with regard to the proposed Association, from about twice as many others, who do not wish to put themselves forward in the scheme, until it shall have received public sanction. In very few quarters, have we found any discountenancing of the idea; and though reasons may be urged against the formation of the Association, we do not admit their validity, so as to alter our own notions upon the subject.

From the number of names we have received, and from the weight duly attached to them, we have no hesitation in declaring our own humble opinion that the Association proposed by "A Welsh Antiquary," may be established with every prospect of success. Indeed, we have little doubt but that, if it be properly organized and carried out with energy by its members and officers, it will prove of great benefit to the cause of Antiquarian and Historical knowledge throughout Wales. The main difficulty in the way of its permanent success, will arise either from the apathy or the dissensions of the members; but we are not anxious to anticipate evils of this nature.

Since the names returned to us, as Editors of this Work, are those of gentlemen who *approve* of the formation of a "Cambrian Archeological Association for the study and preservation of the National Antiquities of Wales," we can consider ourselves in no other light than as the organs of our friends and supporters, and as their servants to carry their wishes into effect. We recommend, therefore, that steps be taken towards the formation of such an Association before the commencement of the ensuing year; and that, as a preliminary one, all those gentlemen, whose names have been already received, be considered members of it, unless they shall before January 1st, 1847, signify their wishes to the contrary. As, however, no association can be formed without some specific set of regulations for its government, we further venture to recommend that the laws and regulations of the Archeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, be adopted; at least, as a temporary code, until the members can have an opportunity of meeting and of deciding upon their own form of government. It is understood, however, that the Cambrian Archeological Association, when formed, is to be of a gratuitous nature; we mean, without any subscription being required on the part of its members: and, we are of opinion that it may be made a perfectly efficient body, without any call of this kind upon the purses of its constituents. In this respect, therefore, the laws of the Archeological Institute, even as temporary regulations, would have to be departed from, —though in the general principles of government they might stand good.

As Wales does not possess any metropolitan city where the Association could have a permanent locality, it must of necessity become an ambulatory body, and must hold meetings at fixed periods in various places. We should be inclined to recommend that it should hold an annual meeting — something like that of the Archeological Institute — at one or other of the chief towns of the Principality and the four bordering counties; and, to prevent local rivalries, that the county towns of those shires should be taken in succession, as places of assembling. As an act of courtesy to all the members at the starting of such a body, it would be desirable to choose some central town for the *first* place of meeting, where the members might congregate, appoint their officers, and transact their business. We do not, however, think that an annual meeting can be attended without some expense, and therefore, we should suppose that all members attending such meetings, would find it necessary to subscribe to some common fund for local purposes, —but not to any other than an inconsiderable amount. Local secretaries should also be appointed for each county, who might attend to the interests of the Association in their several districts.

We throw out these hints with much diffidence; being merely such as occur to us when turning over in our minds the plans most suited to meet the views of our correspondents, and of Welsh Antiquaries in general. The main object of the Association is evidently that of forming Cambrian Archeologists into something like an organized, and harmonious body, whereby they may be able to communicate to each other their observations, and to act together for the common cause, with greater rapidity and effect than if they remained isolated.

As Editors of the *Archaeologia Cambrensis*, we beg leave to offer our pages to the gentlemen who are desirous of constituting this Association, for the purpose of regularly publishing their reports, proceedings, and papers; and we would request of them the permission, in case they accept our proposal, to add to our title that of "Journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association." And further, as our Work has been the medium of making the proposed Association known to the public, we venture to request that whoever feels interested in the question will, without delay, correspond with the Editors on the subject, if there be anything to alter, amend, or add to, their suggestions. Gentlemen desirous of adding their names to the list of members may, if they please, make their wishes known to us; and we will add them to the list of those who approve of the Association. In the meantime, between the day of this present Number appearing and the publication of No. V., we will put ourselves in communication with the gentlemen who have already sent in their names, so that by January 1st, 1847, we hope to be able to announce that the Association is definitively formed, and to publish a list of officers, with the place and time of the first annual meeting.

 Matthew Moggridge, Esq., read the following observations *"On the Preservation of Local Traditions"* as described in [](https://archive.org/details/sim_archaeologia-cambrensis_1851-10_2_8/page/326/mode/2up?q=moggridge):

> Having been engaged in the attempt to trace out ancient traditions, the origin of the names of places, and other things connected with the antiquities of the neighbourhood of Swansea, I was surprised to find how much information on these points has died out within these last few years. This process will go on in an increasing ratio. Traditions are no longer handed down from father to son, as in the olden time. Year by year we become more utilitarian; we occupy ourselves with the things not of the past, but of the present and the future. The spread of knowledge - of reading in particular— works towards the same end, and books take the place of oral communication. Let me not be understood to lament these changes, I only refer to them to show that we are living in a transition period, and that in another ten or —— ears, much of considerable interest, which may now be saved, will be lost for ever. I would therefore beg to suggest the organization of a regular plan for promoting inquiries on the above, or such other points, as to your Society may seem fit, through the medium of your members, and such other as may be disposed to employ a portion of their time in furthering this object. `[At this point there is a footnote: *Such a plan was organized by the Editors of this Journal some years back. They might have saved their time and their paper for any effect produced. Not a single reply was ever made to the questions they put forth— not a single effort made in furtherance of their recommendation !—EDD. ARCH, CAMB.*]` Few places would I think be found where no one could be met with to carry out the plan, if it were undertaken by your Society; at any rate, if not universal, the information obtained would be useful as far as it went, and a spirit would be diffused throughout the country highly favourable to archeological pursuits, and tending to increase the members of antiquarian societies. Each party might take a parish or other definite district, (I am endeavouring to carry out the work over twenty miles round Swansea, but this is rather too wide a range,) and if the most fitting objects of research were suggested to the inquirers by printed forms, something like regularity and uniformity might be expected. In conclusion, I would quote, as exemplifying the object I have in view, one or two passages from a paper read before the Literary and Philosophical Society at Swansea."—Mr. Moggridge then made a few extracts from the paper in question, and, in particular, mentioned as the origin of those "slangs" of land which are so often found in South Wales, mixed up with the estate of a distinct proprietor, the fact that it was at one time usual to gamble for small pieces of land.—" A similar custom to the last prevailed near St. Clear's; but there it partook more of the character of wager of battle, the doughty champions being snails, who were to climb up a pole, the owner of the one who reached the summit first receiving the stakes."

SIXTH ANNUAL MEETING, LUDLOW,

AUGUST 23RD TO 28TH, 1852.
President, The Honourable R. H. Clive, M.P.

Monday, August 23rd.
EVENING MEETING.

THE business of the Association commenced at the New Buildings, at eight o’clock. In the absence of the President, the Right. Hon. the Earl Cawdor, the chair was taken by W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., M.P., Vice-President, who, on behalf of his Lordship, resigned the chair to the President elect, the Hon. R. H. Clive, M.P.
The President then delivered his inaugural address to the Asso- ciation. He began by expressing his own diffidence in undertaking the duty of presiding over a learned body, a duty from which he would have shrunk but for the kind request of the Association, and his own desire to assist in procuring information of value and interest to the neighbourhood with which he was connected. 
...

[Friday August 28th, 1852]

Mr. Moggridge then proceeded to make some observations on the custom of the sin-eater and said,— The custom of employing the *sin-eater* probably obtained in ancient times throughout a large portion of Wales and its Marches. When a person died, the friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate—thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done he received his fee of 2s. 6d., and vanished as quickly as possible from the general gaze; for, as it was believed that he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested in the neighbourhood— regarded as a mere Pariah— as one irremediably lost. In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present century, the people were of a very lawless character. There the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the establishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt and bread were retained, —near Swansea (and indeed very generally) only the plate and salt. In a parish near Chepstow it was usual to make the figure of a cross on the salt, and cutting an apple or an orange into quarters, to put one piece at each termination of the lines. There were other slight variations in those parts of the custom still extant, as indeed variations existed in old times when it prevailed in all its profane absurdity, an instance of which might be found-in the adjoining county, as mentioned by Aubrey in the Lansdowne MSS. at the British Museum.

(See *Hone’s Year Book*, p. 858.) "In the county of Hereford," he says, "was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that, when the corpse was brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, a loaf of bread was brought out, and delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazard bowl of maple full of beer (which he was to drink up), and sixpence in money ; in consideration whereof he took upon him *ipso facto* all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead." Here the same end was sought to be attained by a slightly different form. The difference in the fee was somewhat striking, from whence it might be argued that a Caermarthenshire soul was worth five times as much as that of a Herefordshire man—unless indeed it was not rather to be accounted for by supposing that the stout Marcher had fewer sins to get rid of.

Mr. Allen observed that in reference to the custom of placing salt on a corpse he was able to bear testimony to its existence in another county (Pembroke), in which their Association met last year. When a poor person died, a plate with a heap of salt on it was placed on the body, and in the salt was stuck a lighted candle. He should like to ask Mr. Moggridge if there was any necessary connexion between the custom he had mentioned of the sin-eater, and the one just named by himself. He could not exactly see, but did not deny it. Some persons might think it was rather Romish in its nature. He did not see that there was any connexion between this custom and the introduction of the "sin-eater." The popular notion, in Pembrokeshire, with reference to the placing of salt on the bodies of the dead, was that it kept away the evil spirit. It was usual, after the candle had been lighted, for the friends of the deceased to watch through the night over the body, in order that they might, by their — keep off the evil spirit. As regarded the salt, he thought it might be explained in this way—as an emblem of purification; it might be that the salt was for purification, and the candle for keeping evil spirits away. This was a subject, if any person took delight in it, on which further light may be thrown; for those meetings were not only for the purpose of stating what they knew, but also to induce a search for further information.

The Rev. I. Burleigh James suggested as the origin of the custom the scapegoat mentioned in the Bible.

Mr. Jelinger C. Symons would like to know whether this custom of sin-eating was extinct. If not, to send missionaries abroad would be a farce, while they had customs so disgusting at home.

The President hoped they were not entering into the history of present customs, but into the history of past events. It struck him that even at the present day when that melancholy event took place, the death of an individual, there was always a certain respect paid to the corpse; it was not closed in the coffin, but was left open for a certain time for the inspection of friends; the room was hung, the candles were lighted, and there was always a person in the room who remained during the time that exhibition took place. It was out of respect to the deceased that such ceremony took place,—he could not regard it in any other light; it had been continued from time immemorial; and, with every degree of respect he should entertain towards that custom, there was nothing in it that he could exclaim against.

Mr. Jelinger C. Symons said, of course his impression was as to the custom of the "sin-eater.”" Some part of the custom appears to arise out of respect to the dead.

Mr. Moggridge said—Far be it from him to desire that anything he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of sin-eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped, and the rest still retained; and as he advanced still further he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described as the sin-eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was extinct now. 

Mr. Freeman inquired whether sin-eater was the term used in the district where the custom prevailed?

Mr. Moggridge replied in the affirmative.

After some few observations from Henry Hodges, Esq., and W. W. E. Wynne, Esq.,

Mr. W. Basil Jones observed that the Hon. Chairman had requested him to lay on the table a subscription list for the restoration of Ludlow Church. They would be happy to receive the names of any gentlemen who were desirous to subscribe towards so laudable an object.

The Association then proceeded to private business, ...
