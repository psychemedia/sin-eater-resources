Gchebiaethau. Y BWYTAWR PECHOD. SYR,—Darllenais eich nodiadau arweiniol ar y pwnc uchod yn Y Cymro am Hydref 31ain, gyda dyddordeb mawr. Gwyddwn fy mod wedi clywed son am y ddefod wrth gasglu llafar gwlad, neu fy mod wedi darllen am dani mewn llenyddiaeth Gymreig. Wedi chwilio a chwalu hen gofnodion llafar gwlad, cefais hyd i nodyn yn cyfeirio ati yn union fel y tybiwn, ac yr wyf yn sicr y bydd o ddyddordeb i chwi ac eraill a ymchwilient i'r hen arferion Cymreig, gael hyd i'r cofnodion hyn gan awdwr Cymreig glan gloyw. "Diodlas" neu Diodies y gelwid hi yn JNghymru. Ceir hanes am dani yn Drych yr Amseroedd, (argraph- iad Trefriw, 1820, sydd yn fy meddiant i). Yn tud. 42 dywed- Ymofynydd.—Galarus meddwl mor anystyriol oedd agwedd ein owlad yn y dyddiau tywyll hyny yn enwedig yn wyneb amgylchiad mor sobr a gweled un o flaen eu llygaid wedi myned drwy borth angeu i'r farn a thragwyddoldeb, a hwythau < eu hunain ar syrthio dros y geulan.-Mae'n gof genyf glywed fy nhaid yn son am rywbeth a elwid iJiodlas neu Diodles. A gaf fi glywed genyeh pa beth oadd hwnw ? Sylivedydd.-Pan ddigwyddai i ryw un farw mewn teulu, byddai rhywun tlawd a ddewisai y tenlu yn cael y ffafr o dderbyn y gardod ddedwydd hono, sef y Ddiodles. Y dull i'w rhoddi i'r tlawd oedd fel hyn anfonai y teulu gwpan at wneuthur- wr yr arch, i'w lliwio yr un Iliw a'r arch dau liw arferid ar eirch y pryd hyny, lliw du ar eirch rhai i wedi bod yn briod, a lliw gwyn ar eirch rhai sengl, a phan ddeuai dydd y claddedigaeth, wedi dodi y corph ar elor, cyflwynai penaeth y ty yr elusen goel-grefyddol i'r tlawd, sef torth fawr o fara da, a darn helaeth o gaws, a dryll arian yn blanedig yn y caws, a llonaid y gwpan liwiedig o gwrw, os byddai, neu o laeth, gan eu hestyn dros y corph i'r tlawd yntau a fendithiai, ac a. weddiai ya ddwys a difrifol gydag enaid y marw. Arferai yr holl deulu, y Sul cyntaf ar ol claddu, fyned ar eu gliniau ar y bedd, pob un i ddweyd ei bader. Ac ni choffasnt am neb o'u teulu na'u perthynasau, wedi eu marw, heb ddywedyd yn ddefosiynol iawn, Nefoedd iddo. Teifl yr hen ddefodau hyn gryn oleuni ar gyftwr gwlad, ac y mae Mr Hartland ac eraiil yn gwneud gwasanaeth mawr drwy eu hymdrechion i gael at eu gwraidd. Fel y gwyddoch, mae cryn amrywiaeth yn nulliau y cerid y ddefod allan, ac y mae cofnodion Robert Jones yn amrywio cryn lawer ar adroddiad Mr Matthew Moggridge, ac ychydig ar Leland. Ymddengys adroddiad awdwr y Drych i mi yn fwy goieu na'r un a ddyfynir genych chwi. Yn Hone's, Year Book, dywedir gan Aubrey The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid on a bier, a loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sin Eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard-bowl, of maple, full of beer, which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money in consideration whereof he took upon himself, ipse facto, all the sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. (July 19). Dywed Laurence Howell yn ei History of the Pontificate fod yr arferiad wedi dechreu drwy gamddeongliad o Hosea iv. 8. Bwyta y maent bechod fy mhobl, ac at eu banwiredd hwynt y maent yn dyrchafu eu calon." Ni chaniata gofod nac amser i mi ymhelaethu ar y testyn dyddorol hwn. Digon yw dweyd fod rhai o'r hen ddetion hyn yn cylymu a rhwymo ein hanes a bore oes y byd. Y maent oil yn sylfaenedig ar resymau dyfnach nag a gydnabyddir yn gyffredin. Unwaith, ac am oesoedd, yn banes ein cyndadau, y maent wedi bod yn fynegiad gonest, ac yn attegiad grymus i ffydd oedd, os yn llai goleuedig, yn gyfartal, os nad yn rhagorach, mewn symlrwydd a chynes- rwydd i ffydd yr oes oleu hon. Yn y gwylnosau, yn yr arferiad o dori ychydig o wallt y marw, ac yn aberth y blodau ar Sul neillduol, yr byn sydd yn gwaghau'r trefydd ac yn llanw'r claddfeydd yn Neheudir Cymru y blynyddoedd hyn, yr ydym yn canfod yr un seremoniau a "arferid mewn amrywiol ddulliau yn Syria ac Arabia dair fil o flynyddau yn ol. Pwy yn gydnabyddus a'i Feibl a erys wrth Orsedd Beirdd ein Heistedd- fodau heb i adgofion llawer mil o flynyddoedd dd'od i'w feddwl ? Adgofion Gilgal, a'r deu- ddeg careg hyny," adgofion deuddeg careg allor Elias, &c., olion ein hen gyfathracb ynt, lawer ohonynt. Wnieatville, Rhyl. T. SHANKLAND.

Assertions. THE DIN EATER. SYR, —I read your guidance notes on the above topic in Y Cymro for October 31st, with great humility. I knew that I had heard talk of the ritual during a country's oral gathering, or that I had read about it in Welsh literature. Having searched and broken down old country oral records, I found a note referring to it exactly as we think it is, and I am sure that you and others who researched the old Welsh customs will find it strange to find the records this by a bright-eyed Welsh author. It was called "Diodlas" or Diodies in JNew Wales. There is a story about her in The Mirror of the Times, (Trefriw print, 1820, in my possession). In pg. 42 say- Inquirer. — It was lamentable to think so inconsiderate the attitude of our country in those dark days, especially in the face of such a sober circumstance that one could see before their eyes through a portal of death for judgment and eternity, and themselves < on falling over the hollow.-I remember hearing my grandfather talk about something called iJiodlas or Diodles. Can I hear what that is? Observer.-When it came to pass that someone died in a family, a poor person who chose the thinness would be given the favor of receiving that happy guard, the Goddess. The method of giving to the poor was that the family sent a cup to the coffin maker, to color it the same color as the two-colored coffin used on coffins then, black on some coffins for had married, and single coffins were white in color, and when the day of the burial came, the body was laid on bier, the head of the house presented the religious charity to the poor, a large loaf of good bread, and a piece a large quantity of cheese, and a silver gun embedded in the cheese, and the full cup of beer, if it were, or of milk, spreading it over the body to the poor and the blessed, and a. ya prayed intensely and severely with the soul of the dead. All the family, the first Sunday after burial, used to kneel on the grave, all to wave their flag. And they remembered no one of their family, or of their relations, dead, without saying very devoutly, Heaven to him. These ancient rituals cast a great deal of light on the state of the countryside, and Mr Hartland and others do a great service through their efforts to get to their roots. As you know, there is considerable variation in the manner in which the ritual was conducted, and Robert Jones' records vary considerably on Mr Matthew Moggridge's report, and Leland's. The Mirror author's report seems to me more jarring than the one you are quoted. In Hone's, Year Book, Aubrey tells the manner, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid on a bier, and the loaf of bread was brought out and delivered to the Sin Eater, over the corpse, as also a mazard-bowl, of maple, full of beer, which he had to drink up, and sixpence in money in consideration whereof he took upon himself, ipse facto, all the sin of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. (July 19). Laurence Howell states in his History of the Pontificate that the custom began with a misinterpretation of Hosea iv. 8. They eat the sin of my people, and to their poignancy they exalt their heart. "I have no space or time to elaborate on this daily text. they bind our history and the dawn of the world. They are all founded on deeper grounds than is commonly acknowledged. Once, and for ages, in the bosom of our forefathers, they have been an honest expression, and a powerful attestation to faith, if less enlightened, equally, if not more, in simplicity and warmth to the faith of this age of enlightenment, in the vigils, in the practice of cutting a little of the hair of the dead, and in the sacrifice of flowers on a particular Sunday, the mountain that emptied the towns and filled the burial grounds in Southern Wales these years, we find the same ceremonies "used in various ways in Syria and Arabia three thousand years ago. Who knows his Bible who abides at the Gorsedd of the Bards of our Sessions without the recollection of many thousand years? The recollections of Gilgal, and the thirteen stone, "the recollections of the twelve stone altar of Elias, & c., The remains of our old kinsman in them, many of them. Wnieatville, Rhyl. T. SHANKLAND.

By the Way.

Did the ancient custom of sin-eatiug obtain in Wales within living memory ? It was a most un- canny rite. A piece of bread, sprinkled over with salt, was placed on the bared breast of the dead person the sin-eater, who was paid for the job, ate the bread, washing it down with a mug of beer; the sins of the dead were thus transferred irtl- the eaber, who was consequently looked upon with a feeling of loathing and horror. For was he not selling his soul for a price ? Miss Fiona Macleod, in her Sin-Eater and Other Tales, recently published by Patrick Geddes, de. scribes the custom as it prevailed in the Highlands of Scotland, The scale of pay seems to have been higher there than in Wales. Perhaps the p-ty was regulated by a kind of sliding scale, and varied ac- cording to the amount of sin to be eaten in each case. At all events, the Welsh sin-eater generaily got only a groat, whereas the Gaelic-eater received sometimes as mnch as five shillings. That speaks highly either of the better moral character of our ancestors, or the more developed commercial acute- ness of the Scotch Celts. If the reader has not made the acquaintance of Fiona Macleod's Gaelic stories, let him hasten to do so. There a.e bhree of bhem—" The Pharais,'j u The Mountain Lovers," and "The Sin Eater.' He will fiud them intensely fascinating. Item, showing affinity of thought between Cym- ro and Gael: the Cymro used to call the east wind gwynt traed y meirw (Cymnt fu, p. 409) the Gael, the wind that blows on the feet of the dead." To rebarn to our subject, if anybody can give in- formation about sin eating in Wales, particularly as regards the time when the custom ceased to ex- ist, he will be conferring a favour on your readers, myself included, and providing you, sir, with very acceptable copy." I may say that the leading recent authority on the subject is Mr. Sidney Hart- land, though his services, like the bread in the cns. tom, should be taken with a pinch of salt. Older authorities are Aubrey and others quoted in Hone's Year Book.
