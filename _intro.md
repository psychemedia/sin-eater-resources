Several months ago, I came across a story recorded for the Beyond the Border storytelling festival by Ceri Phillips.

It tells the tale of a sin-eater, and is drawn from a Welsh tradition.

Trying to search for background detail, and lore, around sin eaters was not at first as fruitful as I'd hoped.

But then I stumbled into a debate from the last decade of the 19th century regarding whether there was any evidence that there had been an actual practice of sin-eating: was there any truth in the stories, or was all just hearsay?

So here, from the archives, are the claims and counterclaims made across various publications from the late 1800s, regarding the actual existence, or otherwise, of *The Sin Eater*.

But before we get to the debate, let's start a few years before, and a report ??

Aubrey???
