sins of the dying man in consideration of the sum of ten Transfer- 
thousand rupees. Thus prepared to immolate himself on the ““ t ° f a 
altdr of duty as a vicarious sacrifice for sin, the saint is intro- Brahman 
duced into the chamber of death, and closely embraces the ^ ravan ' 
dying rajah, saying to him, “ O King, I undertake to bear 
all your sins and diseases. May your Highness live long 
and reign happily.” Having thus, with a noble devotion, 
taken to himself the sins of the sufferer, and likewise the 
rupees, he is sent away from the country and never more 
allowed to return. 1 Closely akin to this is the old Welsh 
custom known as “ sin-eating.” According to Aubrey, “ In Transfer- 
the County of Hereford was an old Custome at funeralls to e . nce 
hire poor people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes Sin-eaterin 
of the party deceased. One of them I remember lived in a En s land * 
cottage on Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that when the 
Corps was brought out of the house and layd on the Biere ; 
a Loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the 
Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a Mazar-bowle of maple 
(Gossips bowle) full of beer, which he was to drinke up, and 
sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he took upon 
him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Defunct, and freed him 
(or her) from walking after they were dead. . . . This 
Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) yet by some 
people was observed even in the strictest time of ye Presby- 
terian government : as at Dynder, volens nolens the Parson 
of ye Parish, the kinred of a woman deceased there had this 
ceremonie punctually performed according to her Will : and 
also the like was donne at ye City of Hereford in these times, 
when a woman kept many yeares before her death a Mazard- 
bowle for the Sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in 
this Countie ; as also in Brecon, eg . at Llangors, where Mr. 

Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder ye performing 
of this ancient custome. I believe this custom was hereto- 
fore used over all Wales. ... In North Wales the Sinne- 
eaters are frequently made use of; but there, instead of a 
Bowie of Beere, they have a bowle of Milke.” 2 According

Transfer- 
ence of 
sins to a 
sin-eater 
in India. 


to a letter dated February i, 1714-15, “ within the memory 
of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoyning to 
Wales, when a person dyed, there was notice given to an 
old sire (for so they called him), who presently repaired 
to the place where the deceased lay, and stood before the 
door of the house, when some of the family came out and 
furnished him with a cricket, on which he sat down facing 
the door. Then they gave him a groat, which he put in his 
pocket ; a crust of bread, which he eat ; and a full bowle of 
ale, which he drank off* at a draught. After this he got up 
from the cricket and pronounced, with a composed gesture, 
the ease and rest of the soul departed for which he would 
pawn his own soul. This I had from the ingenious John 
Aubrey, Esq.” 1 In modern times some doubt has been 
thrown on Aubrey's account of the custom. 2 * The practice, 
however, is reported to have prevailed in a valley not far 
from Llandebie to a recent period. An instance was said 
to have occurred about sixty years ago. 8 

Aubrey's statement is moreover supported by the analogy 
of similar customs in India. When the Rajah of Tanjore 
died in 1801, some of his bones and the bones of the two 
wives, who were burned with his corpse, were ground to 
powder and eaten, mixed with boiled rice, by twelve 
Brahmans. It was believed that the sins of the deceased 
passed into the bodies of the Brahmans, who were paid for 
the service. 4 * * * A Brahman, resident in a village near Raipur, 
stated that he had eaten food (rice and milk) out of the hand 
of the dead Rajah of Bilaspur, and that in consequence he 
had been placed on the throne for the space of a year. At

tatudy i. 76, quoted by J. Brand, 

Popular Antiquities , ii. 246 sq. } Bohn’s 

edition (London, 1882-1883). 

* In The Academy > 13th Nov. 1875, 

p. 505, Mr. D. Silvan Evans stated 
that he knew of no such custom any- 
where in Wales ; and the custom seems 
to be now quite unknown in Shrop- 
shire. See C. S. Bume and G. F. 
Jackson, Shropshire Folk-lore (London, 

1883), pp. 307 sq. 

* The authority for the statement is 
a Mr. Moggridge, reported in Archaeo - 
logia CambrensiSy second series, iii. 


330. But Mr. Moggridge did not 
speak from personal knowledge, and as 
he appears to have taken it for granted 
that the practice of placing bread and 
salt upon the breast of a corpse was a 
survival of the custom of “ sin-eating,” 
his evidence must be received with 
caution. He repeated his statement, in 
somewhat vaguer terms, at a meeting 
of the Anthropological Institute, 14th 
December 1875. See Journal of the 
Anthropological Institute , v. (1876)

the end of the year he had been given presents and then 
turned out of the territory and forbidden apparently to 
return. He was an outcast among his fellows for having 
eaten out of a dead man’s hand . 1 A similar custom is 
believed to obtain in the hill states about Kangra, and 
to have given rise to a caste of “ outcaste ” Brahmans. At 
the funeral of a Rani of Chamba rice and ghee were eaten out 
of the hands of the corpse by a Brahman paid for the purpose. 
Afterwards a stranger, who had been caught outside the 
Chamba territory, was given the costly wrappings of the 
corpse, then told to depart and never shew his face in the 
country again . 2 In Oude when an infant was killed it used 
to be buried in the room where it had been born. On the 
thirteenth day afterwards the priest had to cook and eat his 
food in that room. By doing so he was supposed to take 
the whole sin upon himself and to cleanse the family from 
it . 3 At Utch Kurgan in Turkestan Mr. Schuyler saw an old 
man who was said to get his living by taking on himself the 
sins of the dead, and thenceforth devoting his life to prayer 
for their souls . 4 

In Tahiti, where the bodies of chiefs and persons of rank 
were embalmed and preserved above ground in special sheds 
or houses erected for them, a priest was employed at the 
funeral rites who bore the title of the “ corpse -praying 
priest” His office was singular. When the house for the 
dead had been prepared, and the corpse placed on the plat- 
form or bier, the priest ordered a hole to be made in the 
floor, near the foot of the platform. Over this he prayed to 
the god by whom it was supposed that the soul of the 
deceased had been called away. The purport of his prayer

Some of these customs have been 
already referred to in a different con- 
nexion. See The Dying God \ p. 154. 
In Uganda the eldest son used to 
perform a funeral ceremony, which 
consisted in chewing some seeds which 
he took with his lips from the hand of 
his dead father ; some of these seeds 


he then blew over the corpse and the 
rest over one of the childless widows 
who thereafter became his wife. The 
meaning of the ceremony is obscure. 
The eldest son in Uganda never in- 
herited his father’s property. See the 
Rev. J. Roscoe, The Baganda (Lon- 
don, 1911), p. 117.

was that all the dead man’s sins, especially the one for which 
his soul had been required of him, might be deposited there 
that they might not attach in any degree to the survivors, 
and that the anger of the god might be appeased. He next 
addressed the corpse, usually saying, “ With you let the guilt 
!. now remain.” The pillar or post of the corpse, as it was 

. called, was then planted in the hole, and the hole filled up. 

i As soon as the ceremony of depositing the sins in the hole 

'it was over, all who had touched the body or the garments of 

the deceased, which were buried or destroyed, fled precipi- 
!j tately into the sea, to cleanse themselves from the pollution 

I which they had contracted by touching the corpse. They 

I also cast into the sea the garments they had worn while they 

|| were performing the last offices to the dead. Having finished 

their ablutions, they gathered a few pieces of coral from the 
bottom of the sea, and returning with them to the house 
addressed the corpse, saying, “ With you may the pollution 
be.” So saying they threw down the coral on the top of 
the hole which had been dug to receive the sins and the 
defilement of the dead . 1 In this instance the sins of the 
departed, as well as the pollution which the primitive mind 
commonly associates with death, are not borne by a living 
person, but buried in a hole. Yet the fundamental idea — 
that of the transference of sins — is the same in the Tahitian 
as in the Welsh and Indian customs ; whether the vehicle 
or receptacle destined to catch and draw off the evil be a 
person, an animal, or a thing, is for the purpose in hand 
a matter of little moment . 2
