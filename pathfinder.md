A DIET OF SINS

Sin-eating was a curious medieval custom. Certain persons who were hired for a small fee to attend funerals and eat food which had touched the corpse were known as sin-eaters. The origin of this odd practice is not know for certain, although it may be related to the scapegoat of Leviticus 16, and some authorities believe that it was originally suggested by a mistaken interpretation of Hosea 4:8, which reads: "They eat up the sin of my people."

At any rate the food represented the sins of the deceased and by eating it the sin-eater was supposed to take the sins upon himself and thus prevent them from disturbing the rest of the departed soul. Sin-eating was once common in many parts of England, Wales and the Highlands of Scotland and some villages had official sin-eaters who were promptly notified when a death occurred in the community.

Upon his arrival at the home of the deceased the sin-eater, usually an old man, was provided with a low stool on which he placed himself just outside the door of the death chamber.

When the corpse was carried from the house the sin-eater was given and commanded to consume a loaf of bread and a bowl of beer which had been placed on the corpse by a close relative of the deceased, usually a woman. After the sin-eater had eaten the bread and drunk the beer he was given a few pennies and dismissed.

In the most primitive form of the custom it is probable that the sin- eater entered the death chamber and actually ate the bread from the corpse, after which he was given his fee and then driven from the house with curses and perhaps a shower of missiles.

Sin-eating did not entirely disappear from Wales and the neighboring English counties until a generation or two ago, and it also survived until modern times in certain rural sections of Bavaria where a cake was placed on the breast of the corpse and saten by the nearest relative. In certain parts of the Balkan peninsula a small bread image of the deceased is sometimes made and eaten by members of the family.

The Dutch who settled in New York brought from Holland with them the custom of giving funeral attendants "doed-kocks" or dead-cakes marked with the initials of the deceased, and in Lincolnshire, Cumberland and perhaps other English counties "burial cakes" are occasionally served.
