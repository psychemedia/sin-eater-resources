A DIET OF SINS 

Sin-eating was a curious medieval 
custom. Certain persons who were 
hired for a small fee to attend funer- 
als and eat food which had touched 
the corpse were known as sin-eaters. 
rhe origin of this odd practice is not 
know for certain, although it may be 
related to the scapegoat of Leviticus 
16, and some authorities believe that 
it was originally suggested by a mis- 
laken interpretation of Hosea 4:8, 
which reads: “They eat up the sin of 
my people.” 

At any rate the food represented the 
sins of the deceased and by eating it 
ihe sin-eater was supposed to take 
lhe sins upon himself and thus pre- 
vent them from distufbing the rest 
of the departed soul. Sin-eating was 
once common in many parts of Eng- 
land, Wales and the Highlands of Scot- 
land and some villages had official sin- 
ealers who were promptly notified 
when a death occurred in the com- 
munity. 

Upon his arrival at the home of the 
deceased the sin-eater, usually an old 
man, was provided with a low stool 
on which he placed himself just out- 
side the door of the death chamber.

When the corpse was carried from the 
house the sin-eater was given and com- 
manded to consume a loaf of bread 
and a bowl of beer which had been 
placed on the corpse by a close rela- 
tive of the deceased, usually a woman. 
After the sin-eater had eaten the bread 
and drunk the beer he was given a 
few pennies and dismissed. 

In the most primitive form of the 
custom it is probable that the sin- 
‘ater entered the death chamber and 
actually ate the bread from the corpse, 
after which he was given his fee and 


then driven from the house with 
curses and perhaps a shower of mis- 
siles. 


Sin-eating did not entirely disap- 
pear from Wales and the neighboring 
English counties until a generation 
or two ago, and it also survived until 
modern times in certain rural sec- 
tions of Bavaria where a cake was 
placed on the breast of the corpse and 
saten by the nearest relative. In cer- 
tain parts of the Balkan peninsula a 
small bread image of the deceased is 
sometimes made and eaten by mem- 
bers of the family. 

The Dutch who settled in New York 
brought from Holland with them the 
custom of giving funeral attendants 
“doed-kocks” or dead-cakes marked 
with the initials of the deceased, and 
in Lincolnshire, Cumberland and per- 
haps other English counties “burial 
cakes” are occasionally served.
