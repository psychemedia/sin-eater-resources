Another strange old death custom, if it ever existed, was the 
Sin Eater." 

It seems that the first to refer to the subject was Mr. John 
Aubrey, in 1G86, who asserted that there was such a custom in 
Herefordshire and also in North Wales, and at the annual meet- 
ing of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, which was held 
at Ludlow in August, 1852, Mr. Matthew Moggridge, of Swansea, 
made the following observation : '' When a person died, his 
friends sent for the Sin-eater of the district, who, on his arrival, 
placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the 
salt a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the 
bread, which ho finally a,te, thereby eating up all the sins of the 
deceased. This done, he received his fee of 2s. Gd. and vanished 
a^ quickly as possible from the general gaze ; for, as it was believed 
that he really appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of 
all those over whom he performed the above ceremony. He was 
utterly detested in the neighbourhood regarded as a mere Pariah 
as one irredeemably lost." The speaker then mentioned the Parish 
01 Lla,ndebie, in Carmarthenshire, where the above practice was 
said to have prevailed to a recent period. Mr. Allen, of Pem- 
brokeshire, said that the plate and salt were known in that county, 
where also a lighted candle was stuck in the salt, and that the 
popular notion was that it kept away the evil spirit. 

A few years ago, one Rhys read at Tregaroii an interesting 
paper on that town and district, and after referring to the custom 
of keeping vigil over the dead, he makes the following statement : 
' There was also an old custom in the town (Tregaroii) connected 
with the ' Sin-eater/ Where there was a corpse in the house the 
' Sin-eater ' was invited. The relatives of the dead prepared him 
a meal on the coffin, he was supposed to eat the sins of the dead 
mail so as to make the deceased's journey upward lighter." 
The late Chancellor D. Silvan Evans, and other well-informed 
Welshmen, have denied that any such custom as that of the Sin- 
eater ever existed in Wales, and Wirt Sikes, after diligent search- 
ing, failed to find any direct corroboration of it, and I may add 
that, though I venture no opinion of my own upon the subject, 
1 have never come across in any part of Wales any old persons, 
either men or women, who had heard any tradition about it. On 
the other hand, the celebrated Welsh Novelist, Allen Raine, 
informed me a> short time ago, that she knew a man at Carmarthen 
who had seen a "Sin-eater"; and the Rev. G. Eyre Evans showed 
me a portrait of a man that had seen one long ago in the Parish 
of Llanwenog. 
Perhaps the following, which appeared in Volume 15 of " Folk 
Lore," may prove of interest in connection with the subject. The 
writer, Mr. Rendel Harries, who had visited Arc-hag, an Annenial 
village, where he attended service, says as follows in his " Notes 
from Armenia: "At the evening service, to my great surprise, 
I found that when the congregation dispersed, a corpse laid out 
for burial was lying in the midst of the building. It had, in 
fact , been brought in before we came, and was to lie in the Church 
in preparation for burial next day. I noticed that two large flat 
loaves of bread had been placed upon the body. Inquiry as to 
the meaning of this elicited no other explanation than that the 
bread was for the Church mice and to keep them from eating the 
corpse. I did not feel satisfied with the explanation. Some 
months later, on mentioning the incident to some intelligent 
Armenians in Constantinople, they frankly admitted that in 
former days the custom was to eat the bread, dividing it up 
amongst the friends of the deceased. Whether this is a case of 
Sin-eating, I leave Mr. Frazer and Mr. Hartland to decide." 
The question of the alleged Sin-eater in Wales and the Borders 
has several times been discussed in " Bye-Gones," Oswestry, and 
whether there was at any time such strange custom in vogue in the 
country, there are at least ample proofs that it was customary 
io Pembrokeshire, if not in other parts of the country, to place 
a plate of salt on the breast of the corpse, and it was believed by 
some that this kept the body from swelling, and by others that it 
kept a.way the evil spirits. 
Pennant, a very keen observer, noticed a similar custom in 
the Highlands of Scotland 140 years ago, where " the friends lay 
on the breast of the deceased a wooden platter containing a small 
quantity of salt and earth separately and unmixed ; the earth an 
emblem of the corruptible body; the salt an emblem of the 
immortal spirit." 
There are several superstitions in West Wales concerning salt, 
but shall refer to the subject in another chapter. 
It was once the custom in Wales to make the sign of the 
cross on the dead body or a cross was placed at or near his head ; 
and though the ceremony was discontinued long ago, we even 
now occasionally hear the old saying, " Mae e dan ei grwys (h
