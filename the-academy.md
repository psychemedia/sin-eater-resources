COrrespondence The Sin-Eater, by Prof. D. Silvan Evans

THE SIN-EATER. 


Aberystwyth : Jan. 29, 1876. 

At the risk of exposing my “ ignorance” still 
further, and thereby causing additional surprise to 
the writer of the r on the “Legends and 
Folklore of North Wales ” in Blackwood’s Maga- 
sine, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the 
existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. 
Like every other country, the Principality had, and 
still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-eater 
does not appear to be among them. Since the 
appearance of my former letter in the AcADEMY 

ovember 13), I have made all the enquiries I 
could into the subject, with the view of ascertain- 
ing whether such a personage has, or ever had, “a 
local habitation and a name” among us. I have 
spoken to many and corresponded with several 
persons who are known to have paid attention to 
the customs and traditions of the country; and 
the sum of their communications is, without any 
exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater 
was as novel to them as it was to me. 

The writer points to Llandebie as the place 
where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers 
me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. 
Matthew Mogegridge at the annual meeting of the 
Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Lud- 
low in 1852, and is “ surprised ” that I, who became 
connected with the Archaeologia Cambrensis in 1872, 
should not be minutely acquainted with everything 
that appeared in that journal some twenty years 
previously, Whether I ever read the account of 
the Ludlow meeting I cannot now say; but if I 
did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge’s revelations 
had been effaced from my memory when I wrote 
my letter. The writer tells us that “at the 
meeting of the Cambrian archatologists at Lud- 
low in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this 
superstition as having occurred within five years 
at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Car- 
marthenshire.” Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, 
and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for 
sentiments which he never expressed. The de- 
scription of the sin-eater, given by Mr. Moggridge, 
is taken from Aubrey; and the following are his 
words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the 
Archaeologia Cambrensis, the organ of the Associa- 
tion :— 

‘‘In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, 
was a mountain valley where, up to the commence- 





ment of the present century, the people were of a 
very lawless character. There the above practice was 
said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going 
thence to those parts of the country where, from the 
establishment of works, and from other causes, the people 
had more early become enlightened, he found the 
more absurd portions of the custom had been aban- 
doned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, 
within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were 
retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), 
only the plate and salt.” 


Out of this statement the author of the article 
makes “five years”! and by that process brings 
the custom down to 1847, Mr. Moggridge, in a 
letter dated the first day of the present year, tells 
me that he does “not remember anything that 
gives a date,” and adds that “the only written 
account” of the sin-eater “from personal know- 
ledge is that of Aubrey, ‘ de Gentilisme.’” Aubrey, 
if I may rely on the extracts given in the 
ACADEMY, does not say that he was eyewitness to 
the performances of the sin-eater in any part of 
Wales, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, 
no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as 
having prevailed at any time in the Principality ; 
and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of 
the Principality and not of the English counties. 

But let us return to Llandebie, the locality 
in which it is asserted that the custom pre- 
vailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Row- 
lands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author 
of a oni volume of Historical Notes pub- 
lished about ten years ago, and at one time 
librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle 
Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these 
words :— 

“T opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, 
and I lived there for many years. I knew all the 
parishioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, 
customs, and traditions. And during the time I was 
there I attended many funerals, but never heard of 
the ‘sin-eater ;’ in fact people there never give cakes 
at funerals. I know almost every parish in South 
Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of 
the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If 
such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of 
it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring 
untruth.” 

Letters to the same effect appeared in the 
Western Mail, which circulates very extensively 
in the Principality, in the Aberystwyth Observer, 
and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one 
in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin- 
eater. 

The Rey. Rees Evans, Vicar of Llandebie, has 
favoured me with the following letter in answer 
to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on 
the part of your readers for inserting it without 
abridgment :— 

“I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., 
which contained such extraordinary statements in 
reference to a superstitious custom supposed and 
alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the 


employment at funerals of a strange person 
called the ‘sin-eater” I have been the vicar 
of this parish for the last fourteen years, 


and I have known this neighbourhood well for the 
last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I re- 
ceived your letter of such a personage as the ‘sin- 
eater.” However, with the view of arriving at the 
truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. 
Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which ap- 
peared subsequently in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 
and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the 
subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted 
searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this 
parish, as to the probability of there having ever 
existed here such a functionary as ‘sin-eater;’ and 
the result of my investigation in the matter is this :— 
That such a custom’ as that alluded to in your letter 
never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this 
parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid 
opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had 
long conversations while investigating the matter in 
question for you. One intelligent old man, an octo- 
genarian, whose ancestors had lived from time imme- 
morial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in 
his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for 





126 


THE ACADEMY. 


[Fee. 5, 1876. 








the last two hundred years, or he would have heard 
of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a 
great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I 
have made, my candid opinion is that the statements 
which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be sub- 
stantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any 
credible evidence.” 


Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we 
are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on 
his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of 
Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter 
of a century. 

The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge 
as being still seen in some parts have no connexion, 
or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin- 
eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are 
given for their employment. They are not un- 
common, I understand, among Roman Catholics 
at the present day. 

The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest 
on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just 
seen, he does not state that he saw any performance 
of the custom among the Welsh people. Those 
who only retail his statements eek not detain us. 
I leave it to others to judge what amount of cre- 
dibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey 
in any case in which superstition plays a part. If 
we put implicit belief in what he says about the 
sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, 
Ido not see how we can consistently refuse his 
evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and 
similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent. 


In conclusion I would remark that if the 


custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is 
somewhat strange, if not “ surprising,” that the 
discovery of it has been exclusively confined to 
those who are ignorant of the language of the 
natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the 
country. Dz. Bavan Evans.

The Sin- 
Eater, by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans and E. R. 
Morris . ° ° ° ° ° . 197-8 

THE ‘“ SIN-EATER.” 
Llanymawddwy : Feb. 12, 1876. 


The question between the writer in Blackwood 
and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find 
that in his letter in the Academy of to-day he 
mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, 
leaving the point at issue just where it was. He 
stated in his article that the custom of the Sin- 
Eater prevails in North and South Wales at the 
present day; when I challenged that statement 
and asked for proof, we were told that by the 
present day he means some thirty years ago; and 
when pressed for the locality he goes under the 
aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebie “ in the hill- 
country of Carmarthenshire.” When persons 
appeul to certain tribunals, they should not com- 
plain if they are sent to appear before the 
tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, 
and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made 
on the spot by competent persons; and those who 
will take the trouble to read my last letter will 
see with what success, The Sin-Eater is as little 
known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. 
Now the writer shifts his ground and moves, 
under the enlightening guidance of Murray's 
Handbook for Travellers in South Wales, to Cwm 
Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The 
compiler of that volume, whether ever “ connected 
with Monmouthshire Iron Works” or not, states 
nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal know- 
ledge, or from the personal knowledge of any in- 
formants, but quotes almost the identical words 
of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight varia- 
tion as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the Feb- 
ruary number of the Contemporary Review, simply 
relates the same story over again, without any 
corroboration of her own. A false story does not 
become truth by repetition, and these repetitions 





add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is 


simply waste of s to retail them. 

The writer sd. that I did not turn over a 
certain leaf in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, where 
he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeo- 
logists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating 
was carried on at Liandebie wnttl within five years 
of that time (1852). The leaf had been turned 
over and read before 1 wrote my last Iptter; I 
turn it over again, and on it read the last utter- 
ances of Mr. Moggridge as follows :— 

“Mr. Moggridge said—Far be it from him to 
desire that anything he should advance should not be 
combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. Hoe 
thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was 
that there was no immediate connexion between the 
custom of Sin-Eater and.the plate and the salt. Start- 
ing from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the 
most horrible portion of the custom dropped; and the 
rest still retained; and us he advanced still further 
he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from 
whom he quoted, and who was a man of high cha- 
racter, said that the custom had existed both in Here- 
fordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he 
went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw & 
man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he 
(Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where 
Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, 
that the more odious part of the custom had been 
removed, but portions thereof still remained. He 
thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. 
There was only one thing more that he need trouble 
them with, and that was as to whether the custom 
was extinct. He believed that people were thorough] 
ashamed of the practice; one case, he was infienel, 
occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was 
extinct now.” 

These are Mr. Moggridge’s last words at Lud- 
low, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring 
to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it 
must be, as I understand him, to some part of 
Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to 
be more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and 
to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my 
remarks do not apply. Mr. Maagige, and ap- 
parently the writer of the article, assume all along 
that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants 
of the alleged sin-eating practice ; and finding these 
articles employed in certain cases, they take it for 
granted that the “ more odious part of the custom 
has been removed,” which amounts to begging 
the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly 
admits that he never witnessed the “horrid cus- 
tom” at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs: 
us that it “was said to have prevailed: ” 
he does not mention his authorities, nor does he 
so much as hint what means his informants had 
of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. 
I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no dis- 
respect to him when I say that both the vicar and 
the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable 
opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascer- 
taining the facts of the case, on account of their 
connexion with the locality and their knowledge 
of the vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge’s 
opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of 
facts; and opinions, from whatever source they 
may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. 
The question at issue lies within the domain of 
fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge 
has any foundation on a more solid substance than 
“ imagination all compact.” 

It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the 
part of the writer to “refresh” my memory re- 
specting “ the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical 
scapegoat.” It is useless to argue about what 
may, could, or should have occurred, when we 
are concerned only with what has actually taken 

lace. It is needless to expatiate on the possi- 
fility of a custom, when its existence is denied. 
The writer might have spared his sneering remark 
about: the “treason ” of calling Welshmen “ igno- 
rant” and “superstitious.” The qualities. denoted 
by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are 
not confined to the Principality of Wales; and 
one at least of these benighted barbarians holds 
that it is treason against truth to make charges

(Fun. 26, 1876. 








that cannot. be substantiated against any nation, 
however “ ignorant” or “ superstitious ” that na- 
tion may be. The writer seems to assume that it 
is “a point of national honour,” rather than any 
higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate 
groundless imputations. When “ national honour” 
and truth go together, “ national honour” is not to 
be contemned. 

The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on ac- 
count of his incognito. He need not. It is per- 
fectly immaterial whether he retains or doffs it ; 
but it shall not shield him from the consequences 
of making statements of questionable authenticity. 
He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, “ by parent- 
age, ancestry, property, and interests, connected 
with two counties of South Wales”; but he does 
not tell us that his ‘ancestors ever furnished him 
with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or 
that in his frequent visits to our benighted 
country he ever encountered that dread func- 
tionary. Such being the case, I confess to being 
a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees 
and broad acres in two or more counties, fine 
things as they are, to the subject we are now dis- 
cussing. More to the point is the admission 
that, notwithstanding his frequent travels “ over 
most of the Principality,” he has “ failed to acquire 
its language,” that language being the very key to 
its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, 
therefore, must resemble those of a blind man in 
quest of the beautiful. 

If the writer proves, as he states in Blackwood, 
that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is “ still 
surviving in North and South Wales,” I shall at 
once confess my error, and the “ national honour” 
shall take its chance ; but if he fails to do this, he 
ought, in justice to the country of his “ ancestry,” 
to retract the groundless charge. He it is that 
has brought the accusation against it, and on 
him lies the burden of proof.

Homestay, Newtown, Montgomeryshire : February 12, 1876. 

Roscoe, in his Wanderings and Excursions in 
South Wales, quoting the author of the Mountain 
Decameron, locates “ what is believed to have 
been the last Sin-Eater of Wales ” differently from 
any mentioned in the Acadeemy. I subjoin his 
remarks. 

“A gentleman who lived a little before the time of 
this dark superstition becoming obsolete (the earlier 
part of the last century) gives us this brief account 
of what is believed to have been the last ‘ Sin-Eater of 
Wales.’ 

“*T got lost,’ says he, ‘near nightfall, after being 
landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey on 
the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black tur- 
bary of great extent divided me from the road. I was 
cautioned to ride far’ round this pitchy bog, for no 
horse ever ventured among the peat pits, the whole 
being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was 
enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even 
without peril of being swallowed, man and horse. 

“** At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock 
of a rough road rung to my horse’s hoof, and I saw a 
cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a 
distance. 

“*The house was on a high point and turn of 
road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow 
ground. 

“* Just asI came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds 
of wailing within, and soon, a woman came out into 
the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to 
the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had 
heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay 
@ corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit 
of bread placed on its breast. The woman was 
shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office— 
that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead 
breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making 
a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer 
of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man 
for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in 
his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and 
ever.’ 

“This is the traveller's account of this incident. 
He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the 





motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving 
toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he 
caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman’s long 
unanswered, till she kindled, on the high road’s point, 
the straw of her husband’s late bed—the usual signal 
of a death in the house. 

“The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel 
made of sea-wreck and nails of such, between sea- 
marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by 
day, none dare by night, whether for the footing, or 
the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that 
recluse.” 


Persons acquainted with the district readily 
recognise the Tocality from the above description, 
others may do so when I state that the Cam- 
brian Railway, between Machynlleth and Aber- 
ystwith, traverses the “black turbary of great 
extent,” and the high road from Aberdovey 
passes close by one of the railway stations on this 
line, called “ Ynyslas.” The custom of placing a 
late of salt on the breast of a dead person is, I 
imagine, not obsolete in this county yet; at any 
rate instances have occurred within my own 
knowledge. E. R. Morris.
