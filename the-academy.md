COrrespondence The Sin-Eater, by Prof. D. Silvan Evans

THE SIN-EATER. 


Aberystwyth : Jan. 29, 1876. 

At the risk of exposing my “ ignorance” still 
further, and thereby causing additional surprise to 
the writer of the r on the “Legends and 
Folklore of North Wales ” in Blackwood’s Maga- 
sine, I venture to reiterate my doubts as to the 
existence of the sin-eater in any part of Wales. 
Like every other country, the Principality had, and 
still has, her superstitions, but that of the sin-eater 
does not appear to be among them. Since the 
appearance of my former letter in the AcADEMY 

ovember 13), I have made all the enquiries I 
could into the subject, with the view of ascertain- 
ing whether such a personage has, or ever had, “a 
local habitation and a name” among us. I have 
spoken to many and corresponded with several 
persons who are known to have paid attention to 
the customs and traditions of the country; and 
the sum of their communications is, without any 
exception, that the superstition of the sin-eater 
was as novel to them as it was to me. 

The writer points to Llandebie as the place 
where the custom prevailed as late as 1847, refers 
me for confirmation to a statement made by Mr. 
Matthew Mogegridge at the annual meeting of the 
Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Lud- 
low in 1852, and is “ surprised ” that I, who became 
connected with the Archaeologia Cambrensis in 1872, 
should not be minutely acquainted with everything 
that appeared in that journal some twenty years 
previously, Whether I ever read the account of 
the Ludlow meeting I cannot now say; but if I 
did, every trace of Mr. Moggridge’s revelations 
had been effaced from my memory when I wrote 
my letter. The writer tells us that “at the 
meeting of the Cambrian archatologists at Lud- 
low in 1852, Mr. Moggridge cited a case of this 
superstition as having occurred within five years 
at or near Llandebie, in the hill-country of Car- 
marthenshire.” Mr. Moggridge said no such thing, 
and it is hardly fair to make him responsible for 
sentiments which he never expressed. The de- 
scription of the sin-eater, given by Mr. Moggridge, 
is taken from Aubrey; and the following are his 
words in reference to Llandebie, as reported in the 
Archaeologia Cambrensis, the organ of the Associa- 
tion :— 

‘‘In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, 
was a mountain valley where, up to the commence- 





ment of the present century, the people were of a 
very lawless character. There the above practice was 
said to have prevailed to a recent period, and going 
thence to those parts of the country where, from the 
establishment of works, and from other causes, the people 
had more early become enlightened, he found the 
more absurd portions of the custom had been aban- 
doned, while some still remained. Thus near Llanon, 
within twenty years, the plate, salt, and bread were 
retained ; near Swansea (and, indeed, very generally), 
only the plate and salt.” 


Out of this statement the author of the article 
makes “five years”! and by that process brings 
the custom down to 1847, Mr. Moggridge, in a 
letter dated the first day of the present year, tells 
me that he does “not remember anything that 
gives a date,” and adds that “the only written 
account” of the sin-eater “from personal know- 
ledge is that of Aubrey, ‘ de Gentilisme.’” Aubrey, 
if I may rely on the extracts given in the 
ACADEMY, does not say that he was eyewitness to 
the performances of the sin-eater in any part of 
Wales, and therefore, according to Mr. Moggridge, 
no one speaks of it from personal knowledge as 
having prevailed at any time in the Principality ; 
and it will be borne in mind that I am writing of 
the Principality and not of the English counties. 

But let us return to Llandebie, the locality 
in which it is asserted that the custom pre- 
vailed within the last thirty years. Mr. John Row- 
lands, a highly intelligent schoolmaster, author 
of a oni volume of Historical Notes pub- 
lished about ten years ago, and at one time 
librarian to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps of Middle 
Hill, wrote to me on December 14 last in these 
words :— 

“T opened the Llandebie School in the year 1850, 
and I lived there for many years. I knew all the 
parishioners, and the history of the parish; its legends, 
customs, and traditions. And during the time I was 
there I attended many funerals, but never heard of 
the ‘sin-eater ;’ in fact people there never give cakes 
at funerals. I know almost every parish in South 
Wales; I collected all the legends, and made notes of 
the old customs for the late Sir Thomas Phillipps. If 
such a custom had prevailed I should have heard of 
it. I have no hesitation in writing that it is a glaring 
untruth.” 

Letters to the same effect appeared in the 
Western Mail, which circulates very extensively 
in the Principality, in the Aberystwyth Observer, 
and, I am told, in some other papers; but no one 
in reply has put in a plea in favour of the sin- 
eater. 

The Rey. Rees Evans, Vicar of Llandebie, has 
favoured me with the following letter in answer 
to my enquiries, and I must crave indulgence on 
the part of your readers for inserting it without 
abridgment :— 

“I duly received your letter of the 22nd ult., 
which contained such extraordinary statements in 
reference to a superstitious custom supposed and 
alleged to be prevalent in this parish, viz., the 


employment at funerals of a strange person 
called the ‘sin-eater” I have been the vicar 
of this parish for the last fourteen years, 


and I have known this neighbourhood well for the 
last twenty-five years; but I never heard till I re- 
ceived your letter of such a personage as the ‘sin- 
eater.” However, with the view of arriving at the 
truth or falsehood of the statements made by Mr. 
Moggridge at Ludlow in the year 1852, which ap- 
peared subsequently in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, 
and with the view of satisfying my own mind on the 
subject, I have during the last three weeks instituted 
searching enquiries in every part and hamlet of this 
parish, as to the probability of there having ever 
existed here such a functionary as ‘sin-eater;’ and 
the result of my investigation in the matter is this :— 
That such a custom’ as that alluded to in your letter 
never prevailed, at least for several centuries, in this 
parish and neighbourhood. That is the candid 
opinion of all classes of persons with whom I had 
long conversations while investigating the matter in 
question for you. One intelligent old man, an octo- 
genarian, whose ancestors had lived from time imme- 
morial in this parish, told me that such a custom, in 
his opinion, could not have prevailed here at least for 





126 


THE ACADEMY. 


[Fee. 5, 1876. 








the last two hundred years, or he would have heard 
of it from his father or his grandfather, who lived to a 
great age. Therefore, from all the enquiries that I 
have made, my candid opinion is that the statements 
which were made by Mr. Moggridge cannot be sub- 
stantiated by any reliable authority or proved by any 
credible evidence.” 


Such are the results of my enquiries, and yet we 
are asked to believe that the sin-eater carried on 
his nefarious profession in the neighbourhood of 
Llandebie until within a little more than a quarter 
of a century. 

The plate and salt mentioned by Mr. Moggridge 
as being still seen in some parts have no connexion, 
or at least no necessary connexion, with the sin- 
eater, and much more satisfactory reasons are 
given for their employment. They are not un- 
common, I understand, among Roman Catholics 
at the present day. 

The whole story of the sin-eater appears to rest 
on the shoulders of Aubrey, and, as we have just 
seen, he does not state that he saw any performance 
of the custom among the Welsh people. Those 
who only retail his statements eek not detain us. 
I leave it to others to judge what amount of cre- 
dibility is due to so credulous a person as Aubrey 
in any case in which superstition plays a part. If 
we put implicit belief in what he says about the 
sin-eater, whether in England or out of England, 
Ido not see how we can consistently refuse his 
evidence as to ghosts, spectres, witchcraft, and 
similar subjects, about which he is so eloquent. 


In conclusion I would remark that if the 


custom under notice ever existed in Wales, it is 
somewhat strange, if not “ surprising,” that the 
discovery of it has been exclusively confined to 
those who are ignorant of the language of the 
natives, and are but slightly acquainted with the 
country. Dz. Bavan Evans.

The Sin- 
Eater, by the Rev. D. Silvan Evans and E. R. 
Morris . ° ° ° ° ° . 197-8 

THE ‘“ SIN-EATER.” 
Llanymawddwy : Feb. 12, 1876. 


The question between the writer in Blackwood 
and myself is a simple one, and I regret to find 
that in his letter in the Academy of to-day he 
mixes up with it a good deal of irrelevant matter, 
leaving the point at issue just where it was. He 
stated in his article that the custom of the Sin- 
Eater prevails in North and South Wales at the 
present day; when I challenged that statement 
and asked for proof, we were told that by the 
present day he means some thirty years ago; and 
when pressed for the locality he goes under the 
aegis of Mr. Moggridge to Llandebie “ in the hill- 
country of Carmarthenshire.” When persons 
appeul to certain tribunals, they should not com- 
plain if they are sent to appear before the 
tribunals of their choice. Llandebie was named, 
and Llandebie was accepted: enquiries were made 
on the spot by competent persons; and those who 
will take the trouble to read my last letter will 
see with what success, The Sin-Eater is as little 
known there as probably he is in Nova Zembla. 
Now the writer shifts his ground and moves, 
under the enlightening guidance of Murray's 
Handbook for Travellers in South Wales, to Cwm 
Amman, about seven miles from Llandebie. The 
compiler of that volume, whether ever “ connected 
with Monmouthshire Iron Works” or not, states 
nothing about the Sin-Eater from personal know- 
ledge, or from the personal knowledge of any in- 
formants, but quotes almost the identical words 
of Mr. Moggridge at Ludlow, with a slight varia- 
tion as to the locality. Lady Verney, in the Feb- 
ruary number of the Contemporary Review, simply 
relates the same story over again, without any 
corroboration of her own. A false story does not 
become truth by repetition, and these repetitions 





add nothing to our knowledge, and therefore it is 


simply waste of s to retail them. 

The writer sd. that I did not turn over a 
certain leaf in the Archaeologia Cambrensis, where 
he intimates that Mr. Moggridge told the archaeo- 
logists at Ludlow that the practice of sin-eating 
was carried on at Liandebie wnttl within five years 
of that time (1852). The leaf had been turned 
over and read before 1 wrote my last Iptter; I 
turn it over again, and on it read the last utter- 
ances of Mr. Moggridge as follows :— 

“Mr. Moggridge said—Far be it from him to 
desire that anything he should advance should not be 
combated, for all he wished to get at was truth. Hoe 
thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen was 
that there was no immediate connexion between the 
custom of Sin-Eater and.the plate and the salt. Start- 
ing from the Carmarthenshire valley, he found the 
most horrible portion of the custom dropped; and the 
rest still retained; and us he advanced still further 
he found that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from 
whom he quoted, and who was a man of high cha- 
racter, said that the custom had existed both in Here- 
fordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he 
went to a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw & 
man whom he described as the Sin-Eater; and he 
(Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district where 
Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, 
that the more odious part of the custom had been 
removed, but portions thereof still remained. He 
thought that the plate and salt were of eastern origin. 
There was only one thing more that he need trouble 
them with, and that was as to whether the custom 
was extinct. He believed that people were thorough] 
ashamed of the practice; one case, he was infienel, 
occurred four or five years ago, but he believed it was 
extinct now.” 

These are Mr. Moggridge’s last words at Lud- 
low, and I fail to find a syllable in them referring 
to Llandebie; and if he refers to any place, it 
must be, as I understand him, to some part of 
Herefordshire, with which the writer appears to 
be more acquainted than I can pretend to be, and 
to which, as I have already distinctly stated, my 
remarks do not apply. Mr. Maagige, and ap- 
parently the writer of the article, assume all along 
that the plate and salt are necessarily remnants 
of the alleged sin-eating practice ; and finding these 
articles employed in certain cases, they take it for 
granted that the “ more odious part of the custom 
has been removed,” which amounts to begging 
the whole question. Mr. Moggridge candidly 
admits that he never witnessed the “horrid cus- 
tom” at Llandebie or elsewhere, but informs: 
us that it “was said to have prevailed: ” 
he does not mention his authorities, nor does he 
so much as hint what means his informants had 
of knowing the truth or untruth of the story. 
I can assure Mr. Moggridge that I mean no dis- 
respect to him when I say that both the vicar and 
the schoolmaster have enjoyed more favourable 
opportunities than he is likely to have had of ascer- 
taining the facts of the case, on account of their 
connexion with the locality and their knowledge 
of the vernacular. I value Mr. Moggridge’s 
opinions as opinions; but we are now in quest of 
facts; and opinions, from whatever source they 
may emanate, must not be mistaken for them. 
The question at issue lies within the domain of 
fact, and, therefore, capable of proof if the charge 
has any foundation on a more solid substance than 
“ imagination all compact.” 

It is very kind, but slightly superfluous, on the 
part of the writer to “refresh” my memory re- 
specting “ the vicarious sin-bearing of the Levitical 
scapegoat.” It is useless to argue about what 
may, could, or should have occurred, when we 
are concerned only with what has actually taken 

lace. It is needless to expatiate on the possi- 
fility of a custom, when its existence is denied. 
The writer might have spared his sneering remark 
about: the “treason ” of calling Welshmen “ igno- 
rant” and “superstitious.” The qualities. denoted 
by these elegant stock-epithets, unfortunately, are 
not confined to the Principality of Wales; and 
one at least of these benighted barbarians holds 
that it is treason against truth to make charges 








198 


THE ACADEMY. 


(Fun. 26, 1876. 








that cannot. be substantiated against any nation, 
however “ ignorant” or “ superstitious ” that na- 
tion may be. The writer seems to assume that it 
is “a point of national honour,” rather than any 
higher motive, that induces Welshmen to repudiate 
groundless imputations. When “ national honour” 
and truth go together, “ national honour” is not to 
be contemned. 

The writer appears to feel rather uneasy on ac- 
count of his incognito. He need not. It is per- 
fectly immaterial whether he retains or doffs it ; 
but it shall not shield him from the consequences 
of making statements of questionable authenticity. 
He vouchsafes to inform us that he is, “ by parent- 
age, ancestry, property, and interests, connected 
with two counties of South Wales”; but he does 
not tell us that his ‘ancestors ever furnished him 
with any information concerning the Sin-Eater, or 
that in his frequent visits to our benighted 
country he ever encountered that dread func- 
tionary. Such being the case, I confess to being 
a little hazy as to the relevance of long pedigrees 
and broad acres in two or more counties, fine 
things as they are, to the subject we are now dis- 
cussing. More to the point is the admission 
that, notwithstanding his frequent travels “ over 
most of the Principality,” he has “ failed to acquire 
its language,” that language being the very key to 
its customs, legends, and folk-lore. His travels, 
therefore, must resemble those of a blind man in 
quest of the beautiful. 

If the writer proves, as he states in Blackwood, 
that the superstition of the Sin-Eater is “ still 
surviving in North and South Wales,” I shall at 
once confess my error, and the “ national honour” 
shall take its chance ; but if he fails to do this, he 
ought, in justice to the country of his “ ancestry,” 
to retract the groundless charge. He it is that 
has brought the accusation against it, and on 
him lies the burden of proof.

Homestay, Newtown, Montgomeryshire : February 12, 1876. 

Roscoe, in his Wanderings and Excursions in 
South Wales, quoting the author of the Mountain 
Decameron, locates “ what is believed to have 
been the last Sin-Eater of Wales ” differently from 
any mentioned in the Acadeemy. I subjoin his 
remarks. 

“A gentleman who lived a little before the time of 
this dark superstition becoming obsolete (the earlier 
part of the last century) gives us this brief account 
of what is believed to have been the last ‘ Sin-Eater of 
Wales.’ 

“*T got lost,’ says he, ‘near nightfall, after being 
landed by the ferry-boat from the Aber of Dovey on 
the Cardiganshire side of that estuary. A black tur- 
bary of great extent divided me from the road. I was 
cautioned to ride far’ round this pitchy bog, for no 
horse ever ventured among the peat pits, the whole 
being a quaking morass. In truth, its look was 
enough, under a black evening, to keep me off, even 
without peril of being swallowed, man and horse. 

“** At last, thanks to my stars, the good hard rock 
of a rough road rung to my horse’s hoof, and I saw a 
cottage taper, as ghastly as the Canwyll Corph, at a 
distance. 

“*The house was on a high point and turn of 
road, overlooking all those many acres of hollow 
ground. 

“* Just asI came up, hoping lodging, I heard sounds 
of wailing within, and soon, a woman came out into 
the dead night, late as it was, and cried a name to 
the top pitch of her wild voice, that seemed one I had 
heard weeping indoors. When I looked in, there lay 
@ corpse of a man, with a plate of salt holding a bit 
of bread placed on its breast. The woman was 
shouting to the Sin-Eater to come and do his office— 
that is, to eat the bread, lay his hand on the dead 
breast, place the dead man’s on his own, after making 
a sign of the cross, and then praying for a transfer 
of all pains or penances from that pardoned dead man 
for ever, to him that more than dead alive, himself in 
his death of soul, but not of its pains, for ever and 
ever.’ 

“This is the traveller's account of this incident. 
He had the curiosity to wait, and saw at last the 





motion of what seemed a foggy meteor moving 
toward their standing-point. After waiting long, he 
caught a far-out shout in reply to the woman’s long 
unanswered, till she kindled, on the high road’s point, 
the straw of her husband’s late bed—the usual signal 
of a death in the house. 

“The Sin-Eater, he was told, lived alone in a hovel 
made of sea-wreck and nails of such, between sea- 
marsh and that dim bog, where few could approach by 
day, none dare by night, whether for the footing, or 
the great fear, or at least awe, which all felt of that 
recluse.” 


Persons acquainted with the district readily 
recognise the Tocality from the above description, 
others may do so when I state that the Cam- 
brian Railway, between Machynlleth and Aber- 
ystwith, traverses the “black turbary of great 
extent,” and the high road from Aberdovey 
passes close by one of the railway stations on this 
line, called “ Ynyslas.” The custom of placing a 
late of salt on the breast of a dead person is, I 
imagine, not obsolete in this county yet; at any 
rate instances have occurred within my own 
knowledge. E. R. Morris.

CORRESPONDENCE. 
THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. 
Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 14, 1895. 
During the recent discussion at the British 
Association meeting on cannibalism, I ventured 
to point out that there was reason to believe 
that the practice had once extended over a much 
wider area than we might be disposed a prior 
to think; and in support of my statement I 
referred, among other things, to the custom of 
Sin-eating, described by John Aubrey as 





existing in his time on the Welsh border and 
in Wales. This I explained as the relic of a 
more ancient custom of eating the corpse. My 
observations, when reported, called forth «a 
letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, who, writing 
from Oswestry to the Times, absolutely denied 
the existence of the Sin-eater in Wales, 
declaring that ‘‘if the dissemination of false news 
is @ crime in a newspaper, it is far worse in a 
member of the Folklore Society,” and calling 
my attention to the correspondence in the 
ACADEMY in the winter of 1875-76, in which 
Canon Silvan Evans, he seemed to think, had 
finally disposed of the evidence. 

As a matter of fact, I had to confess that I 
had not heard of that correspondence, and I 
found some difficulty in getting it. By the 
courtesy of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Woodall, I 
have now had the opportunity of reading it, 
and my opinion is unchanged by the perusal. 
As it may be desirable that the question should 
be thrashed out in the arena where the first 
blow was struck, and as, moreover, the Sin- 
eater furnishes meat lacking, perhaps, some- 
thing of the savour most appetising for readers 
of a daily newspaper, I ask you to allow me to 
review the evidence in your columns. 

Before dealing with the negative evidence, 
let us see what positive evidence of the custom 
can be found. 

The stories, as Mr. Thomas says, all go back 

to Aubrey, who, we are told, is ‘‘none too 
strong a witness.” It is true that the stories 
all go back to Aubrey, in the sense that he is 
the earliest writer to mention the custom, and 
that he gives the fullest account of it. He 
says (Lemaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme, 
p. 35): 
**In the County of Hereford was an old Custome 
at funeralls to hire poor people, who were to take 
upon them all the sinnes of the y deceased. 
One of them I remember lived in a cottage on 
Rosse-high way. (He was a long, leanc, ugly, 
lamentable poor raskal.) The manner was that 
when the Corps was brought out of the house and 
layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of Bread was brought 
out, and delivered to the sinne-eater over the 
corps, as also a mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips 
bowle) full of beer, w°" he was to drinke up, and 
sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he 
tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the sinnes of the 
Defunct, aud freed him (or her) from walking after 
they were dead.” 


In Brand and Ellis’s Observations on Popular 
Antiquities (ed. 1813, vol. ii., p. 155) is re- 
printed from Leland’s Collectanea a letter from 
a Mr. Bagford, giving a slightly varied account, 
professedly derived from Aubrey, placing the 
scene of the custom in Shropshire, the time 
‘‘ within the memory of our fathers,” and stat- 
ing the fee paid to the Sin-eater as a groat. 
On this, if it stood alone in reference to Shrop- 
shire, I should lay no stress. It might con- 
tain the result of additional inquiries by 
Aubrey; it might, on the other hand, be only 
the inaccurate recollection of a verbal com- 
munication by him to Mr. Bagford, really 
referring to Herefordshire. If we compare it, 
however, with the cases cited further on, we 
shall have reason to think that the custom 
actually obtained in Shropshire. 

I do not know what grounds Mr. Thomas may 
have for casting doubt upon Aubrey’s testi- 
mony. Aubrey was a careful and enlightened 
inquirer into old customs; he travelled about 
England and Wales with his eyes open; his 
bona fides is not to be questioned; and his 
description of the ceremony, and the expres- 
sions he makes use of, testify to his having 
something more as a foundation for his state- 
ments than casual gossip. A little lower down 
he adds: 


‘*This Custome (though rarely used in our dayes) 
yet by some people was observed even in the 
strictest time of y° Presbyterian goverment: as 
at Dynder, volexs nolens the Parson of y* Parish, 

















__ ee ee 





[Nov. 9, 1895.—No. 1227, 

















388 ; 


the relations of a woman deceased there had this 
Ceremonie punctually performed according to her 
will: and also the like was donne at y° City of 
Hereford in these times, when a woman kept many 
yeares before her death a Mazard-bowle for the 
sinne-eater ; and the like in other places in this 
Countis: as also in Brecon, ¢.., at Lilangors, 
where Mv. Gwin the minister could no hinder y° 
perfoiming of this ancient custome.”’ 


Aubrey does not, indeed, profess to have him- 
self witnessed these instances of the ceremony. 
If we depended entirely for evidence of events 
and customs on the affidavits of eye-witnesses, 
we should introduce a canon of evidence un- 
known to historical investigation, and should 
reject much that no reasonable man can 
doubt. 

Leaving for the moment what he says about 
Llangors, I pass to Derbyshire, a district where 
the Britons long maintained their independence, 
and the population of which is probably still 
to a great extent of Celtic ancestry. Recent 
inquiries by Mr, 8S. O. Addy have shown that 


*‘at afuneral in Derbyshire wine is first offered 
to the bearers who carry the corpse. This 
custom is strictly maintained, the guests not 
receiving any wive until the funeral party has 
returned from church... . When you drink 
wine at a funeral, every drop that you drink isa 
sin which the deceated has committed. You 
thereby take away the dead man’s sins and bear 
them yourself ’’ (Jlowsehold Tales, with other Tra- 
ditional Remains, collected in the Counties of York, 
Lincoln, Derby, and Nottingham, 1895, pp. 123, 124). 


This, there can hardly be a doubt, is a sur- 
vival of a stmilar custom to that of the Sin- 
eater. The same effect is assigned to the act 
of drinking; and the ritual requires that the 
wine should first be offered to certain of the 
funeral officials. 

Returning to Shropshire, we find a drinking 
custom recorded by an eye-witness in the reign 
of Charles II. M. Jorevin, apparently a 
Frenchman travelling in England, relates that 
he was present at a nobleman’s funeral at 
Shrewsbury. The minister made a funeral 
oration to the assembled friends and relatives 
in the chamber where the body lay. ‘‘ During 
the oration there stood upon the coffin a large 
Pot of Wine, out of which every one drank to 
the health of the deceased.’’ When this was 
finished the funeral proceeded. (Brand and 
Ellis, vol. ii., p. 153.) It is true that there 
is no special Sin-eater here, nor any words 
indicating the assumption by the survivors of 
the sins of the dead. But it will be observed 
that the health of the deceased can mean only 
‘* the ease and rest of the soul departed,” which 
is‘ exactly the expression placed in the Sin- 
eater’s mouth by Mr. Bagford. The ceremony, 
in fact, looks uncommonly like that of Sin- 
eating transplanted to an upper stratum of 
society, and accompanied by modifications such 
as that transplantation would in course of time 
evolve, The same custom was still practised at 
Market Drayton as lately as July 1, 1893. Miss 
Gertrude Hope, writing in Folklore (vol. iv., 
p. 392), gives the particulars as related to 
her by an eye-witness. After the bearers had 
lunched, ‘‘ the coffin was brought down and 
placed on two chairs in the centre of the room, 
and, the mourners having gathered round it,” 
a short service was then and there conducted 
by the Nonconformist minister, as is frequently 
done, before setting out for the grave. 
‘‘Directly the minister ended the woman in 
charge of the arrangements poured out four 
glasses of wine and handed one to each bearer 
present across the coflin, with a biscuit called 
a ‘funeral biscuit.’’’ Mark what follows. 
‘The minister, who had lately come from 
Pembrokeshire, remarked to my informant that 
he was sorry to see that pagan custom still 
observed. He had been able to put an end to 


it.in the Pembrokeshire village where he had 





formerly been.” Here the food and drink were 
handed across the coffin to the bearers—the 
same officials who in Derbyshire first partake 
in a formal manner of the drink which is 
believed to have the effect of taking away 
the sins of the deceased. The relation of the 
ceremony to that of the Sin-eater is apparent. 
The evidence, if not literally at first hand, 1s 
such as cannot be doubted. 

If, fortified by this evidence from Derbyshire 
and the Marches, we turn to Wales, we find 
Aubrey’s statements of a very circumstantial 
character ; and that not merely in the case of 
Llangors referred to just now. Speaking of 
offertories at funerals, he says (Remains, p 23): 


‘These are mentioned in the Rubrick of y° 
Oh. of Engl. Comon-Prayer booke: but I 
never saw it used, but once at Beaumaris, in 
Anglesey ; but it is used over all the counties of 
North-Wales. But before when the corps is 
brought out of Doores, there is Cake and Cheese and 
a new Bowle of Beere, and another of Milke with y° 
Anno Dni ingraved on it, & y°® parties name 
deceased, w°" one accepts of on the other side of 
y° Corps, and this Custome is used to this day [1686] 
in North Wales.” 

This is precisely the ceremony of Sin-eating, 
save that Aubrey does not record the words 
uttered. The testimony is perhaps all the 
stronger that he does not thus expressly con- 
nect it with a practice which he elsewhere 
declares he believed to have been ‘‘ used over 
all Wales.” It would seem that he had 
actually beheld it in this shape; though his 
words are not free from ambiguity. At all 
events, it is clear that he had made minute 
inquiries. A century later Pennant describes 
the same custom among several others ‘‘ used 
among us in former times, which have been 
gradually dropped in —— as the age 
grew enlightened.” He says: 


**Previous to a funeral, it was customary, when 
the corpse was brought out of the house and laid 
upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, 
mother, sister or daughter (for it must be a 
female), to give, over the coffin, a quantity of 
white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a 
cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain 
poor persons. After that they presented, in the 
same manner, a cup of drink, and required the 
person to drink alittle of it immediately. When 
that was done, they kneeled down, and the 
minister, if present, said the Lord’s Prayer; after 
which, they proceeded with the corpse (Zours in 
Wales,’’ ed. 1883, vol. iii., p. 150). 


Pennant was born and lived in Wales; and | gran 


we must suppose that he is describing what he 
was perfectly familiar with by the reports of 
his neighbours and friends, if he had not 
himself witnessed it. 

The explicit statements of Aubrey and 
Pennant must be put side by side with the 
evidence already given of the minister at 
Market Drayton, that the custom had survived 
to recent years in Pembrokeshire. And, since 
all the acts of the ceremony were identical with 
those of the Sin-eater, and only the ritual 
words were wanting, they prepare us to believe 
Mr. Matthew Moggridge when he reports that 
words and all were used at Llandebie, a few 
miles from Swansea, down to a few years before 
1852, when he read a paper on the subject at 
Ludlow to the Cambrian Archaeological Asso- 
ciation. It is unnecessary to quote the paper, 
which is to be read in Archaeologia Cambrensis 
(vol. iii., N.S., p. 330), as it mentions no material 
variation of the ceremony. The omission of the 
ritual words is to be accounted for by the 
presence of the clergy, who would doubtless 
regard them as blasphemous. The clergy, as 
Aubrey tells us, found the rite too deeply 
rooted to be successfully prohibited; but in 
deference to them, it is probable that a com- 
promise would be adopted. The acts would 
continue to be performed, the words interpret- 



ing and completing those acts would be 
dropped. 
I will ask permission to consider the negative 
evidence in another letter.

THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. 
Il. 
Highgarth, Gloucester: Oct. 25, 1895. 


Before I examine the negative evidence, let 

me revert for a moment to Pennant’s statement 
cited in my previous letter. I am indebted to 
Mr. J. P. Owen, who, writing lately to Prof. 
Rhys, has pointed out that this statement is 
derived from the same source as an account of 
‘* Ancient Usages and Customs in North 
Wales,’”’ contained in the British Magazine for 
April, 1835 (vol. vii., p. 399), and there said to 
be “from a MS. book of a Bishop of St. Asaph, 
written about a century ago.” The British 
Magazine is now lying before me, and the 
passage runs as follows: 
** When the corpse is brought out of the house, 
and laid upon the bier, and covered before it b3 
taken up, the next of kin to the deceased—widow, 
mother, daughter, or cousin (never done by a man) 
—gives cross over the corpse to one of the poorest 
neighbours two or three white loaves of bread and 
a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it, and 
then a new wooden cup of drink, which some will 
require the poor body that receives it immediately 
to drink a little of. When this is done, the 
minister (if present) eaith the Lord's prayer, and 
then they set forward towards church.”’ 

The way iu which Pennant deals with the entire 
account, omitting or varying some usages and 
inserting others, suggests that, though he 
unquestionably had the MS. or a copy of it 
before him, he supplemented or varied it in 
accordance with information obtained else- 
where. In the passage I have quoted I would 
draw attention, for example, to his graphic 
touches ee the loaves as presented “in 
a great dish,” and bringing the funeral party 
before us as kneeling down when the Lord’s 
Prayer was repeated, which are not to be found 
in the British Magazine. Perhaps the omis- 
sions may be equally significant, but naturally 
they are less to be trusted. The whole account 
should, however, be compared, for doing which 
I have no space here. In any case, the detail of 
‘* new wooden cup,” overlooked or purposely 
left out by Pennant, is worth noting as an 
independent confirmation of Aubrey some half 
century after he wrote. 

Now, what is the negative evidence? It 
amounts to this : 

1. Canon Silvan Evans himself, though 
accustomed from his profession to attend 
funerals, and though interested in folk-lore, 
never found a trace of the custom; nor has he 
found it mentioned in Welsh literature. 

2. He made inquiries in the year 1875 of the 
Vicar of Llandebie, who, together with Mr. 
Rowland, the schoolmaster, denied the existence 
of — practice ee — = — 
oc ian in the ish, of whom the vicar 
Sy Te 

3. The Rev. T. Eynon Davies also denied it 
ia reference to Cwmamman, founding his denial 





not merely upon his own experience (not a very 


long one in 1882), but also upon the declara- 
tions of octogenarians. 

None of these denials, nor all of them 
together, can outweigh the positive evidence 
of Aubrey, Pennant, and the minister at 
Market Drayton. Even if we assume, what I do 
not see my way at present to admit, namely, 
that Pennant was merely reproducing the 
statement of the Bishop of St. Asaph (or 
whoever may have been the writer of his 
MS.), it is clear that the latter was 
describing the custom as still subsisting when 
he wrote. Thus, the custom that certainly 
existed uncurtailed in the seventeenth century 
at Llangors maintained itself, shorn of the 
ritual words, well into the eighteenth century 
in North Wales, and down to a few years ago 
in Pembrokeshire. We may be sure it did not 
maintain itself only in these places. I do not 
understand that Canon Silvan Evans’s denials 
extend to England. But to admit the exist- 
ence of the practices (and they can hardly be 
denied) in Shropshire and Derbyshire is to lend 
strong countenance to the probability of 
similar practices in many districts of Wales. 
Mr. Matthew Moggridge did not claim to have 
been an eye-witness—we cannot even affirm 
that he saw and examined eye-witnesses; but 
it is possible, and even likely, that he did, seeing 
that he lived at Swansea, only twelve or 
thirteen miles from Llandebie. His assertions. 
at any rate, were evidently not made at 
random, but were the result of investigations. 
He may have been misled. So may Aubrey 
and the writer of the Bishop of St. Asaph’s 
MS. In that event it is remarkable that the 
accounts they give, while agreeing in the 
main, present just the differences we might 
expect from independent writers describing a 
custom liable to all the variations of traditional 
practice. Nor will the hypothesis that these 
writers were misled get rid of the evidence of 
the minister at Market Drayton. He at 
least could not have been mistaken about a 
custom which he had himself succeeded in 
putting down. 

It is unfortunate that Canon Silvan Evans’s 
inquiries at Llandebie were not set on foot 
until more than a quarter of a century after 
the alleged event. The lapse of time must 
affect the value of his negative results. More 
than this, however. His inquiries were made 
through the clergyman and the schoolmaster. 
The latter, indeed, was, we are told, an old resi- 
dent ; but the clergyman had only been vicar 
for fourteen years, though he described himself 
as having known the neighbourhood well for 
twenty-five years, which may mean much or 
little. We have no means of knowing in what 
form these gentlemen in turn put their 
questions. That may make all the } ~ Tener 
In any case, they are precisely the persons who 
would not be likely to discover the superstition 
if it existed. The Rev. Elias Owen, diocesan 
inspector of schools, and one of the chief 
authorities on Welsh folk-lore, relates that once, 
being in a certain parish for the purpose of 
examining the school, he took the opportunity 
of asking the clergyman concerning the super- 
stitions of the place, when he was met by the 
dignified repulse, ‘‘ Qur people are not super- 
stitious, I am glad to say.” His inspection 
over, he asked the first class, ‘‘ Now, children, can 
you tell me of any place where there is a buggan 
(ghost or bogey) to be seen, or of anyone who 
has seen one?” Instantly every hand was 
stretched out, and every child had a story to 
tell. The fact is, the people hide their super- 
stitions from all such representatives of modern 
culture as clergymen and schoolmasters ; and 
it is by no means an uncommon experience that 
the existence of matters of the kind perfectly 
well-known to the peasant is stoutly denied by 
that same peasant to the clergyman when he 





asks about them. The Roman Catholic priest,

who has in the confessional a weapon much 
more powerful than the Anglican, is often 
baffled by his flock. The testimony of the Rev. 
C. F. Ryan, curate of Drangan, when before 
the magistrates on the Clonmel ‘“ Witch- 
burning” inquiry, is of the greatest weight on 
this point. He said he had heard “ nothing, 
absolutely nothing,” of the doings which ended 
in the unfortunate victim’s death, until all was 
over. Asked if he did not think that very 
extraordinary, he replied : 

**No, Ido not. The priest is very often the last 
to hear of things like that—generally, I should 
say. . . I had no suspicion of foul play or 
witchcraft, and if I had 1 should have at once 
absolutely refused to say mass in the house, and 
have given information to the police at once.”’ 


The reason of the concealment from the priest 
or the minister comes out here. It is founded 
on the known hostility of such personages to 
the ancient superstitions. 

So far, then, as regards the actual practice 
of Sin-eating in Wales in modern times, it must 
be said, with all respect to Canon Silvan 
Evans (whose services to Welsh learning are 
recognised by everyone), that his denials and 
the results of his inquiries do not countervail 
the positive evidence; and the same remark 
applies with even greater force to the Rev. 
Eynon Davies, whose inquiries were made 
later still. But in order to complete the case, 
I must add something as to Canon Evans’s 
failure to find any allusion to the Sin-eater in 
Welsh literature. This, however, I shall have 
to reserve for next week.

CORRESPONDENCE. 


THE SIN-EATER IN WALES. 
Il. 
Highgarth, Gloucester: Nov. 4, 1895. 

I have now dealt with the positive evidence 
derived from English sources—that is to say, 
from writings in the English language—and 
with the negative evidence of the inquiries by 
Canon Silvan Evans at Llandebie and by the 
Rev. Eynon Davies at Cwmamman, and of the 
general acquaintance of the former with Welsh 
folk-lore. 

But Canon Evans not only failed to trace the 
Sin-eater in Welsh folk-lore; he failed also to 
trace him in Welsh literature. Here he has me 
at a disadvantage. Iam not conversant, as he 
is, with Welsh literature. I do not doubt, 
however, that many English customs have 
existed, and perhaps exist even yet, of which 
no indication can be found in ordi English 
literature; and it may be the same in Wales. 
But Ishould like to ask: what has he looked 
for, and how has he locked for it? He is him- 
self a lexicographer of distinction ; and he is 
doubtless acquainted with the work of his pre- 
decessor, Owen Pughe. If he will turn to the 
letter D he will find the word Diawdlestr thus 
defined: “A drinking cup, also 4 cup full of 
drink so-called, superstitiously given for the 
dead, which in some places is called diawdlyst, 
and cwpan y meirw”; and Diawdlyst is ex- 
plained as “‘The give-ale.” I owe this refer- 
ence to Mr. Owen. Prof. Rhys has been kind 
enough to make a little further search. He 
has turned up in Thomas Richards’s Welsh and 
English Dictionary (Trefriw, 1815) what seems 
to be one form, if not the original and true 
form, of Pughes’s Diawdlyst, namely Diodlifft, 
explained by Cwppan dros y meirw cup for, 
or on behalf of, the dead), with a reference to 

Davies.” The reference to Davies seems to 
be not to Davies’s still older Welsh Dictionary, 
but rather to his ‘MS. notes.” We have here 
at least three words expressive of a cup of 
drink yy ynys lg for the dead, point- 
ing not to an isolated, but to a widely known 
custom of some kind. To what can they point, 
if not to the practices detailed in my first letter 
and in the extract from the Bisho of St. 
fseph’s MS, ? And that they do in fact refer 
to hem there is proof in Welsh literature. 

Cymru Fu is @ little book published anony- 
mously at Wrexham, bearing no date on the 
title-page, but having the preface dated 1862. 





It is a sort of omnium gatherum of Welsh 
history, literature, and traditions. Among 
other things, it contains an account of popular 
funeral customs. The portion (p. 91) which 
is = to my present purpose, runs as 
follows : 


** Before the sad procession started for the 
church the friends and nearest relations collected 
about the corpse to bewail and lament their loss, 
while the rest of the company were in another 
room drinking warm beer and smoking their pipes, 
and the women in another room still were drinking 
tea together. After the coffin was carried out of 
the house and laid on the bier beside the door, one 
of the relations of the deceased gave bread and 
cheese over the coffin to poor people, who, in 
expectation of these gifts, had been diligently 
gathering flowers and herbs to bestow in the coffin. 
Sometimes a loaf of bread with a piece of mone 
stuck in it was added to these [gifts]. Then a 
the mourners knelt down, and the clergyman, if 
present, repeated the Lord’s Prayer, and the pro- 
cession stopped and — the same  pneee at 
every cross-way until they reached the church.” 

I think it is undeniable that the writer had 
Pennant before him while writing this passage ; 
and I have Lage, se J translated it so as to 
bring out the identities of expression. But 
allowing for this, it is clear that he has other 
sources of information from which he adds 
particulars given neither by Pennant nor in 
the Bishop of St. Asaph’s MS. Such are 
the description of the proceedings before the 
corpse was taken out of the house, and the 
details of where the coffin was placed outside 
the house (gerllaw y drws), and of the pre- 
sentation of flowers and herbs in return for the 
bread and cheese. 

Scepticism, however, may deny the authority 
of so modern a compilation as Cymru Fu. Let 
me, therefore, turn to an account of the same 
custom, written at least ay ya earlier. 
It occurs in a little book ed Drych y 
Amseroedd. The purport of the book is de- 
scribed in the title-page, which may be rendered : 


‘‘ Mirror of the Times; comprising a little of the 
history of the most remarkable things that have 
happened, chiefly in Gwynedd, during the last 
two centuries in relation to religion. In the 
form of a conversation between Inquisitive and 
Observer.”’ 


Its author was a Calvinistic Methodist minister, 
named Robert Jones, of Capel y Dinas, pre- 
viously of Rhoslan; and it was published at 
Llanrwst, presumably in 1820, for that is 
the date of the preface, though there is none 
on the title-page to the second edition, to which 
alone I have access. In the course of the con- 
versation, Inquisitive says (p. 50) : 


‘*T remember hearing my grandfather talk about 
something called Diod/as or Diodles. Oan you tell 
me what it was ?”’ 


And Observer replies : 


‘¢ When someone happened to die in a family, a 
certain poor man was chosen by the family to have 
the favour of receiving that happy charity, the 
diodles. The manner of giving it to the poor man 
was this: the family sent to the workman who 
made the coffin a cup to be coloured the same 
colour as the coffin. ‘I'wo colours were customary 
for coffins at that time: black for the coffins of 
married, and white for those of unmarried persons. 
When the day of the funeral came, after putting 
the corpse on the bier, the head of the house pre- 
sented the superstitious alms to the poor man— 
namely, a large loaf of good bread, an ample piece 
of cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, and 
the coloured cup full of beer, if there was any, or 
else of milk, reaching them over the corpse to the 
poor man. He in return blessed and prayed fer- 
vently and earnestly with the dead man’s soul 
[gyd dg enaid y marw).” 

The last sentence is one of some difficulty. 
But, whatever the true rendering, it cannot 
denied that we have in the custom described a 
practice of giving a cup full of drink for, 





or on behalf of, the dead. The bread, cheese, 
and money are of course given for the same 
purpose; and prayers and blessings of no 
ordinary kind are expected and given in return. 
If this be not a local variant of the practice 
delineated by Aubrey—a variant, moreover, 
affected by the natural ceremonial decay of, 
say, two more generations—perhaps Canon 
Silvan Evans or Mr. Thomas will have the 
goodness to tell us what it is, or how he would 
propose to discredit the witness. Until then I 
shall hold, as I think most of the readers of 
these letters will hold, that it is strong and 
independent confirmation of the existence of 
the custom of sin-eating, or, what is the same 
thing, of sin-drinking in Wales. How is it, then, 
that Canon Silvan Evans has been unable to 
trace it in Welsh literature? The explanation 
lies, I believe, in his having looked for a func- 
tionary called the Sin-eater, and for a Welsh 
form of the word “ sin-ester,” while students 
of tradition would look for the custom. He 
has missed the substance in seeking for the 
shadow. And yet I think I have shown that 
even the search for the shadow need not have 
been in vain. There are, at least, four words in 
the language expressive of the custom, or of 
the cup with which it was performed: Cwpan 
y meirw, the cup of the dead; Diawdlestr or 
Diodlestr, the cup of drink superstitiously given 
for the dead; Diodlifft, which Prof. Rhys 
suggests to me, is, perhaps, partly an English 
loan-word, ee the drink lifted over 
the dead; and, lastly, the JDiodles, the 
Venedotian word for the custom, meaning 

ssibly the drink-boon. Canon Evans’s great 

ictionary has not yet progressed beyond 
the letter C. I do not know why he has 
omitted Cwpan y meirw from it: no doubt not 
without some reason. When he publishes D 
he will have an opportunity of explaining the 
other three words, and incidentally of telling 
us why he passed over the curious Cwpan y 
meirw. 

I have now shown, by examination both of 
the positive and of the negative evidence, that 
there is abundant ground for believing in the 
existence of the custom of sin-eating in Wales. 
I have shown it in the Marches down to the 

ear 1893; I have shown it in Brecknockshire 
in the seventeenth century; I have shown it 
in Pembrokeshire down to recent years ; I have 
shown it in Powisland in the eighteenth 
century; I have shown that in Gwynedd, or 
the western part of North Wales, it had not 
died out of memory in the year 1820, though 
probably it was no longer practised. The 
united force of the testimony I have adduced— 
concurrent, be it remembered, in its main lines, 
and not diverging in detail more than we might 
reasonably expect from the differences of 
locality and of time—is very great; nor can 
it be set aside by pooh-poohing Aubrey. 
I might have adduced other English evidence ; 
and where Canon Silvan Evans has failed to 
find evidence lying upon the surface of Welsh 
literature—nay, in his very path as a philolo- 
gist—it is not impossible that careful inquiry 
may discover further references to the custom. 
Even as the matter stands, however, it is amply 
proved. I have dealt with its meaning in the 
second volume of my Legend of Perseus, lately 
published by Mr. David Nutt, and have there 
traced parallel practices over a large part of 
Europe, and, indeed, of the world. Here I will 
only add that I believe it to be an interesting 
relic of immemorial antiquity, originating 
probably in the custom, expressly ascribed by 
Strabo to the Irish, of the eating of dead 
parents. If so, Mr. Thomas may derive some 
comfort from the conjecture that after all the 
custom properly belongs rather to the Goidelic, 
than to the Cymric branch of the Celtic race. 
Upon this speculation it is not my business to 
enter. E, SmipnEY HarTLanp.
