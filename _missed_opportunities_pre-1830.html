<h1>Missed Opportunities, Prior to 1830<a class="headerlink" href="#missed-opportunities-prior-to-1830" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Our story to date has tracked back through the sources originally identified from Mr. Matthew Moggridge’s observations to the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, as well as the reports and queries that arose directly from that event.</p>
<p>These references include Hone’s Year Book, 1831-32, the second edition of Leland’s <em>Collectanea</em>, edited by Thomas Hearne and published in 1774, and various edition’s of Brand’s <em>Observations on the popular antiquities</em> as edited by Henry Ellis in a version dating back to 1813. All these sources draw ultimately on John Aubrey’s manuscript, as well, perhaps as conversation with him, that can be found as part of the Lansdowne manuscripts held by the British Library.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll see whether there were any other popular, or at least, published sources that Moggridge might have overlooked, or been unaware of, that were published prior to his talk in September, 1852.</p>

<p>North Wales; including its scenery, antiquities, customs, and some sketches of its natural history;
by Bingley, William, 1774-1823</p>
<p>Vol II</p>
<p>1804</p>

<p>The Manners and Customs of the Welsh</p>
<p>It is an opinion very prevalent within the diocese of St. David’s in Pembrokeshire, that a short time previous to the death of a person, a light is some-times seen to proceed from the house, and even from the bed, and to pursue its way to the church where the body is to be interred, precisely in the same track that the funeral will afterwards follow. This light is call <em>canwyll corph</em>, or “the corpse candle.”</p>
<p>A strange cuftom prevails in fome obscure parts of North Wales, which, however, the clergy have now almost abolished. This is termed the “offering of an enemy.” When a person supposes himself highly injured by any one, he repairs to some church dedicated to a celebrated saint, or one who is believed to have great power over the affairs of men ; here kneeling on his bare knees before the altar, and offering a piece of money to the faint, he utters the most virulent and dreadful imprecations, calling down curses and misfortunes on the offender and his family even for generations to come. Sometimes the offended persons repair for the same purpose to some sacred well, dedicated to a saint. Mr. Pennant was threatened by a man, who fancied he had been injured by him, “with the vengeance of St. Elian, and a journey to his well, to curse him with effect.”</p>

<p>North Wales; including its scenery, antiquities, customs, and some sketches of its natural history;

<p>1804</p>
<p>p287-8</p>
<p>The Manners and Customs of the Welsh</p>
<p>It is usual in several parts of North Wales, for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person, of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment ; and in some instances for weeding and adorning it, on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals, for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called <em>Diodlys</em>, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where at the same time the body is standing on a bier. It had its name from the custom, which is now discontinued, of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. — When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord’s prayer ; after which they proceed with the body to the church. Four of the next of kin take the bier upon their shoulders ; a custom which is considered as expressive of the highest mark that even filial piety can pay to the deceased. If the distance from the house to the church be considerabie, they are relieved by some of the congregation ; but they always take it again before they arrive at the church. — I have been informed that in some parts of the country it is usual to set the bier down at every cross-way, and again when they enter the church-yard, and at each of these places to repeat the Lord’s prayer.</p>
<p>In some parts of Wales it was formerly customary for the friends of the dead to kneel on the grave, and there to say the Lord’s prayer for several Sundays subsequent to the interment, and then to dress the grave with flowers. — It was also reckoned fortunate for the deceased if a shower of rain came on while they were carrying the body to church, that his coffin might be moistened with the tears of heaven.</p>

<p>SCHROSBERY.</p>
<p>The Severn is navigable to Schrosbery ; I passed it over a large stone bridge. At the entrance there is a suburb, the church of which appears to me to have formerly belonged to some fine abbey. I ascended from thence to the town, which is mounted on the platform of a rock, scarped on almost every side, which renders its situation naturally strong ; besides which, the wall that encloses it makes it difficult to be scaled. The environs consist of large woods and high mountains. Nevertheless, this town is filled with people and rich shopkeepers, who dwell in two large streets, one leading to the market-place, and the other turning from this place towards the left, near which are the Great Church, the Exchange and Town-hall. They are in a street called [Hight Street] Aystrit, which is so broad that it seems a long market-place, terminating at one of the ends of the town ; where stands the castle, and commands it, being more elevated, and by so much the stronger as it is environed on one side by broad ditches, closed with good walls, and on the other there is no approach to it, on account of the steepness of the rock ; but it has been ruined by the late wars, insomuch that, excepting a few towers and some lodgings within, I see nothing remarkable.</p>
<p>I met nothing more pleasing to me than the funeral ceremonies at the interment of a My Lord, which mine host procured me the sight of. The relations and friends being assembled in the house of the defunct, the minister advanced into the middle of the chamber, where, before the company, he made a funeral oration, representing the great actions of the deceased, his virtues, his qualities, his titles of nobility, and those of the whole family ; so that nothing more could be said towards consoling every one of the company for the great loss they had sustained in this man, and principally the relations, who were seated round the dead body, and whom he assured that he was gone to heaven, the seat of all sorts of happiness, whereas the world that he had just left was replete with misery. It is to be remarked, that during this oration there stood upon the coffin a large pot of wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased, hoping that he might surmount the difficulties he had to encounter in his road to Paradise, where, by the mercy of God, he was about to enter; on which mercy they founded all their hope, without considering their evil life, their wicked religion, and that God is just. This being finished, six men took up the corpse, and carried it on their shoulders to the church ; it was covered with a large cloth, which the four nearest relations held each by a corner with one hand, and in the other carried a bough. The other relations and friends had in one hand a flambeau, and in the other a bough, marching thus through the street, without singing, or saying any prayer, till they came to the church, where, having placed the body on trestles, and taken off the cloth from the coffin (which is ordinarily made of fine walnut-tree, handsomely worked and ornamented with iron bandages, chased in the manner of a buffet) the minister then ascended his pulpit, and, every one being seated round about the coffin, which is placed in a kind of parade in the middle of the church, he read a portion of Holy Scripture, concerning the resurrection of the dead, and afterwards sang some psalms, to which all the company answered. After this he descended, having his bough in his hand like the rest of the congregation ; this he threw on the dead body when it was put into the grave, as did all the relations, extinguishing their flambeaux in the earth with which the corpse was to be covered. This finished, every one retired to his home without farther ceremony, and I departed from Schrosbury for Chester. Having passed over a large desert plain, I reached Addar, Morton, and a castle. The country here is barren. Passed a river near a windmill ; from thence to Pries and Vitechurch, on a river. Here is a manufactory of woollen cloth. The road lies afterwards over some mountains, where are several good inns, all alone ; Empost is one. Came to Anlai, and some small woods, having the river on the right, which runs to Chester.</p>

<p>Ariconensia, or, Archaeological sketches of Ross and Archenfield : illustrative of the campaigns of Caractacus, the station Ariconium, &amp;c, with other matters never before published</p>
<p>by Fosbroke, Thomas Dudley, 1770-1842; Wordsworth Collection</p>
<p>1821</p>
<p>p72-4</p>
<p>The following are matters which the author ascribes to the middle ages, at least he can assign no earlier date.</p>
<p>The first is the singular custom, now obsolete, of <em>Sin-eathig</em>.</p>
<p>It appears, that so late as the seventeenth century, there was in the villages, adjoining to Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed; Ellis, the editor of the Popular Antiquites has extracted the following curious passage from the Lansdowne Manuscripts, concerning a <em>Sin-eater</em>, who “lived in a cottage, on Rosse highway.”</p>
<p>“In the county of Hereford was an old custom at Funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the house, and layd in the Biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the Corps, as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up] and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof lie took upon him, <em>ipso facto</em>, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old lawe, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22. ” And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their: transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goate, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the Goate shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the Goate goe into the wilderness,”</p>
<p>This custome (though rarely used in our day,) yet by some people was observed, even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the Parish) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her will; and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. [Popular Antiq. ii. 156.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Formerly flowers were strewed before young couples, in their way to church. The author once saw a malicious caricature of this custom. Nosegays of rue enclosing a piece of half-eaten bread and butter were dropt in the church-path and porch by a deserted female, in order to denote an unhappy wedding. Stephens, in his plaine Country Bridegroom, p. 353, says “He shews neere affinity betwixt Marriage and Hanging ; and to that purpose, he provides a great Nosegay, and shakes hands with every one he meets, as if he were now preparing for a condemned man’s voyage.

<p>CUSTOMS AT DEATHS. The “Vulgar Errors” of Browne, with the. interesting notes and additions of Mr. Ellis, recently published, furnish us with a curious detail of the various customs formerly observed at deaths, and several of which are yet retained in different parts of England. The article, as given in the work, is prolix, and contains some extraneous matter, which we think might have been omitted with advantage. In the following extracts we have selected only the parts most entertaining: they are ranged under several heads, as— “The Passing- Bell,” “Watching The Dead,” “Setting Salt or Candles on the Body,” “The carrying of Torches and Lights,” “Funeral Sermons,” &amp;c.</p>
<p>The PASSING BELL, so called from its denoting the passing or departing of any one from life to death, was originally intended to invite the prayers of the faithful for the person who was dying, but was not yet dead ; and though in some instances superstitiously used, has its meaning clearly pointed out in a clause in the ” Advertisements for Due Order,” &amp;c. in the seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, which enjoins ” that when anye Christian bode is in passing, that the <em>bell be toled</em>, and that the Curate be speciallie called for to comfort the sicke person ; and after the time of his passing, to ring , : no more but one short peale; and one before the buriall, and another short peale after the buriail.” Grose, refeiring to the old Catholic belief on this subject, treats it rather ludicrously, though its intention, as just duscribed, was evidently serious. ” The Passing Bell,” says he, ” was anciently run! , for two purposes; one to bespeak the prayers of all good Christians for a soul just departing ; the other, to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the bed’s foot, and about the house ready to seize their prey, or at least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage ; but by the ringing of that bell (for Durandus, a writer of the twelfth century, inform us evil spirits are much afraid of bells) they were kept aloof; and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start, or had what is; by sportsmen, called law.”</p>
<p>In the diary of Robert Birrel, preserved in ” Fragments of Scottish History,” &amp;c. is the following curious entry :- 1566, the 25 of October, word came to the towne of Edinburghe, from the Queine, yat hir Majestic was deadly seike, and desirit ye bells to he run e ,we, and all ye peopile to resort to ye Kirk to pray for her, for she was so seike that none lepsied her life” (expected. her to live.) Bourne supposes, that from the saying mentioned by Bede, “Loan have mercy on my soul,” which St. Oswald uttered when he fell to the earth, has been derived the distich so often introduced in ballads on the melancholy occasion of a coining execution</p>
<p>When the bell begins to toll,
LORD have mercy on my soul “</p>
<p>In a very rare book entitled ” Wits, Fits, and Fancies,” (1614) the author relates a droll anecdote concerning the ringing out at the burial of” a rich clunk and a begger who were buried at one time, in the same churchyard, and the bells rang out amiable for the miser. Now the wiseacre, his son, and executor,” says he, ” to the ende the worlde might not thinke that all that ringing was for the begger, bat for his father, hyred a trumpetter to stand all the ringing while in the belfrie, and between every peak, to sound his • trumpet, and proclame aloud and saye, sirres, this next peale is not for R, but for maister N,-,his father.” There seems to be nothing more intended at present by tolling the Passing Bell, but to inform the neighbourhood of some person’s death.</p>
<p>The Jews used trumpets instead of bells. The Turks do not permit the use of them at all. The Greek Church under their dominion still follow her old custom of using wooden boards, or iron plates full of holes, which they hold in their hands and knock with a hammer or mallet, to call the people to church. China has been remarkably famous for its bells. Father Le Compte tells us, that at Pekin, there are seven bells, each of which weighs 120,000 lbs.</p>
<p>WATCHING WITH THE DEAD.—This is called in the North of England the <em>Lake Wake</em>, a name plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon <em>lic</em> or <em>lice</em>, a corpse, and wwce or wake, a vigil or watching. It is used, in this sense by Chaucer, in his ” Knight’s Tale :”</p>
<p>” Shall not be told by me
How that arcite is brent to ashen cold,
Ne how that there the Liche-wake was y-hold
All that night long.”</p>
<p>Pennant, in describing Highland ceremonies. says,” The Late Wake is a ceremony used at funerals. The evening after the death of any one, the relation or friends of the deceased meet at the house, attended by a bagpipe or fiddle, tbe nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting—that is, crying violently at the same time ; and this continues till daylght, but with such. gambols and frolics among the younger part of the company, that the loss which oecasions their meeting, is oftcn more than supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corpse remain unburied for two nights, the same rites are renewed. Thus, Scythinu-like, they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery.” The cus!om in North Wales, we are informed by the same writer, is, ” the night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, bringing with them some small present, of bread, meat, and drink (if the family be something poor), but more especially candles, whatever the family be, and this night is called wyl nos, whereby the country people seem to mean a watching night. Their going to suck a house, they say, is i wilior coml,l, to watch . the corpse ; but wylo signitieS to weep ‘and, lament, and so wy/ nos may be a. night of lamentation. While they stay together on that night, they are either singing psalms, or reading some part of the Holy Scriptures. Whenever any body comes into a room where a dead body lies, especially on the wyl nos, and the day of its interment, the first thing he does, he falls on his. knees by the corpse and says the Loan’s Prayer.”</p>
<p>The ” Irish Hudibras” (I 689 humorously describes an Irish wake—</p>
<p>” To their own sports (the Masses ended)
The mourners now are recommended.
Some sit and chat, some laugh, some weep,
Some sing cronans, and some do sleep;
Some court, some scold, some blow, some puff,
Some take tobacco, some take snuff.
Some play the trump, some trot the hay,
Some at machan ‘ l , some noddy play:
Thus mixing up their grief and sorrow,
Yesterday buried kill’d to•mor_row.”</p>
<p>LAYING OUT, OR STREEKING THE BODY.—Durand, at the remote period at which he lived, gives a pretty exact account of some of the ceremonies used at laying out the body, as practised at pment in the north of England, where the laying out is called streeking. He mentions the closing of the eyes, the decent washing, dressing and wrapping up in a clean ‘winding-sheet, or linen shroud, as well as other anciont observances. The interests of our woollen manufacture have interfered with this ancient rite in England. To the laying out may be added the very old custom of setting salt, and placing a lighted candle upon the body, both which are used to this day in some parts of Northumberland. The salt, a little of which is set in a pewter plate upon the corpse, is, according to the learned Morex, an emblem of eternity and immortality. It is not liable to putrefaction itself, and preserves other things that are seasoned with it from decay. The lighted candle, the same author conjectures to have been the ‘Egyptian hieroglyphic for life.</p>
<p>Aubrey, in some miscellanies of his, among the Lansdown MSS., at the British Museum, mentions a very curious custom at deaths, observed in a degree until his time (reign of Charles II), which he describes - under the name of <em>Sin-Eaters</em>. ” In the ‘County of Hereford,” says he, “was an old custome at Funeralls, to hire poor people, who were to take upon-them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of theme (he was a long lean ugly lumeutable raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layed on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl, of maple, full of beere (which lie was to drink up), and sixpence in money: in consideration he took upon him, <em>ipso facto</em>, all the the sinnes of defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.” This custom, he supposes, had some allusion to the scape-goat under the Mosaical law.</p>
<p>FUNERAL SERMONS.—Speaking of the frequency of these formerly, and their present disuse :—” Even such a character as the infamous Mother Creswell, the procuress in the. reign of Charles II,” our author observes, ” must have her Funeral Sermon. ” She, according to Granger, desired by will to have a sermon preached at her funeral, for which the preacher ws to have 101., .but upon the express condition that he only spoke well of her. A preacher wan with some difficulty found, who undertook the task. He, after a sermon preached on the general subject of morality, and the good uses to be made of it, concluded by saying—’ By the will of the deceased, it is expected I should mention her, and say nothing but what is well of her. All I shad say of her, therefore, is this :—she was born well, she lived well, and she died well, for she was horn with the name of Creswell, she lived in Clerkeuwell, and she died in Bridewell.” A game of cards. Lady Eizabeth Seymour, who, as housekeeper of 1-lamp.. ton Court Palace, has apartments there, occupies them. her Ladyship, with visitors, took an airing in the neighbourhood, on Wesinesday, in an open carriage. On Saturday week, two greyhounds, the property of John Wood, Esq. while very closely pursuing a hare in the neighbourhood of Penarth Church, Glamorganshire, were precipitated over the cliff, a height of 250 feet, and, woncerful to relate, escaped unhurt. The hare doubled at the edge . of the cliff, and the dogs being at full stretch, were onbe t ) recover themselves.</p>
