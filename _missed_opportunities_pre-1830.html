<h1>Missed Opportunities, Prior to 1830<a class="headerlink" href="#missed-opportunities-prior-to-1830" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Our story to date has tracked back through the sources originally identified from Mr. Matthew Moggridge’s observations to the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, as well as the reports and queries that arose directly from that event.</p>
<p>These references include Hone’s Year Book, 1831-32, the second edition of Leland’s <em>Collectanea</em>, edited by Thomas Hearne and published in 1774, and various edition’s of Brand’s <em>Observations on the popular antiquities</em> as edited by Henry Ellis in a version dating back to 1813. All these sources draw ultimately on John Aubrey’s manuscript, as well, perhaps as conversation with him, that can be found as part of the Lansdowne manuscripts held by the British Library.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll see whether there were any other popular, or at least, published sources that Moggridge might have overlooked, or been unaware of, that were published prior to his talk in September, 1852.</p>

<p>On page 338, we find the following reference to a funeral custom involving a food offering, drink and a payment made to a poor visitor:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>PREVIOUS to a funeral, it was customary, when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, sister, or daughter (for it must be a female) to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great dish, and sometimes a cheese, with a piece of money stuck in it, to certain poor persons. After that they present, in the same manner, a cup of drink, and require the person to drink a little of it immediately. When that is done, all present kneel down; and the minister, if present, says the Lord’s Prayer: after which, they proceed with the corpse; and at every cross-way, between the house and the church, they lay down the bier, kneel, and again repeat the Lord’s Prayer; and do the same when they first enter the church-yard. It is also customary, in many places, to sing psalms on the way; by which the stillness of rural life is often broken into, in a manner finely productive of religious reflections.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This appears to be the offering of a dole, for there is no implication of the poor persons taking the sins of the deceased unto themselves.</p>
<p>On the previous page, page 337, is another custom that is worthy of remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THE well of St. Aelian, a parish not far from Llandrillo in Caernarvonshire, has been in great repute for the cures of all diseases, by means of the intercession of the saint; who was first invoked by earnest prayers in the neighboring church. He was also applied to on less worthy occasions, and made the instrument of discovering thieves, and of recovering stolen goods. Some repair to him to imprecate their neighbors, and to request the saint to afflict with sudden death, or with some great misfortune, any persons who may have offended them. The belief in this is still strong; for three years have not elapsed since I was threatened by a fellow (who imagined I had injured him) with the vengeance of St. Aelian, and a journey to his well to curse me with effect.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this case, it seems that prayers at to a holy well associated with St Aelian can be used to call forth a curse on one who has wronged the person uttering the imprecation. It’s not clear what the process for “discovering thieves” is, but I am intrigued to find out.</p>

<p>Potentially a source of confusion in the naming, Peter Roberts’ 1815 work <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/cambrianpopular00robegoog/page/n196/mode/2up"><em>“The Cambrian Popular Antiquities”</em></a>, or to give it it’s full name, <em>The Cambrian Popular Antiquities, or, an account of some traditions, customs, and superstitions of Wales, with observations as to their origins</em>, includes a section on <em>Burials</em>, p173-8. This makes <em>no mention</em> at all of the sin-eater tradition, which suggests either “censorship”, or that Roberts’ was not failialr with the tradition in the Welsh context at least:</p>
<p>The relevant chapter opens with some comments on the potential motivations for ceertain funeral customs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>BURIALS.</p>
<p>When human cares terminate, and human attachments are rent asunder, by the departure of the spirit from its mansion of clay, whatever may have been the previous apprehensions of the event, the affections of the survivors will not, on a sudden, yield to the full conviction of the loss sustained ; and the lifeless body retains some share of that affectionate regard which, when animated, it possessed. But its stillness is awful, and whilst the separated spirit may, even by suffering imagination to prevail but feebly, be supposed to hover over its newly relinquished habitation, a sacred respect to what remains will be felt as a duty, and the solemnity of the moment will be increased by the image it presents, of that which the beholder must at one time present to others.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On such an occasion the customs of different nations have varied much, according to their religious ideas and local situations, but all agree in testifying respect for the dead ; the grief of the surviving friends, and sympathy, or a wish to console, on the part of the neighbourhood. In uncultivated and rugged minds, grief is a burden, which they struggle to throw off in violent exclamations, and by frantic gesture ; they look to others for assistance, and, in the intermissions of exhausted efforts find a relief in the attempts equally rude of their friend to divert their attention. Not so the gentler feeling. There grief sinks deep into the heart ; and brooding every remembrance of the past, multiplies and cherishes its sorrows. With the more common and the rougher nature, the customary mode is to prevent reflection, and divert the attention; and hence it has been usual in some places, for the friendly neighbours to assemble in the house of mourning, and watch or stay up all the night previous to the funeral with the relations. The intent of this watching has, however, been often abused ; and instead of comforting the afflicted, the company have been so desirous of banishing all serious thoughts, as to turn the occasion into one of drinking and amusement; and has, therefore, I presume, been so far dropped as it is in North Wales, and very properly.</p>
<p>The author then cites Pennant.</p>

</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>Roberts own commentary then continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After that the corpse has been brought into the church, and the lesson has been read, it is the custom, in some parts of North Wales, that a psalm is. sung, and the clergyman being at the altar, while the psalm is singing, those who attend the funeral as friends of the deceased, approach the altar in succession, and lay
on a small bracket (which is provided for the purpose) an offering of money, according to the wealth of the oflferer, and the respect for the deceased. This offering has been considered, as originally intended to pay for masses for the soul of the deceased ; but, I believe, it was originally an offering for the support of the clergy- man, as the custom is not, that I have been able to learn, known in England ; and the clergy of the ancient British church were supported chiefly by voluntary offerings on the public occasions. In other respects, the funeral is conducted generally as in England ; but when the service is over, the friends who have attended it do, in many places, kneel down at the grave, and say the Lord’s prayer before they depart from it, and for several succeeding Sundays they repair to the grave, and do the same. In many parts, and especially in South Wales, the friends of the deceased take much and laudable pains to deck the grave with flowers. A bordering of slates or stones, is nicely run around it, and the top bound in by stones laid with taste, in a tesselated manner, which has an ornamental effect, whist it remains a monument of a pious affection, gratified in paying its last tribute to a beloved or revered object.</p>

The following is an excerpt from letter XIII, on pp 362-5, in which various funeral customs are described:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Previous to a funeral it is usual for the friends of the deceased to meet in the apartment where the corpse is placed ; some of them, generally the female part, kneel round it, and weeping bitterly, lament and bewail the loss of their departed friend. When it is brought to the door, one of the relations gives bread and cheese and beer over the coffin to some poor persons of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the dead, for collecting herbs and flowers to put into the coffin with the body ; some-times a loaf, with a piece of money stuck in it, is added. This done, all present kneel down, and the minister, if present, repeats the Lord’s Prayer. At every cross-way they stop, and the same ceremony is repeated, till they arrive at the church. Frequently the intervals are filled up by singing of psalms and hymns, which amidst the stillness of rural life, and the echo from the hills, produces a melancholy effect ; and adds to the sombre solemnity of the occasion.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The author notes that the tradition resembles that of a Scottish tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A similar custom prevails in the Highlands, which they term <em>Coranich</em>.

<p>A monetary offering made to a presiding minister is also described:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After the general thanksgiving, the minister goes to the communion-table, where he reads the two prayers which are usually, in other places, read at the grave; and then concludes with the prayer of St. Chrysostom and the Valete Grace. This done, he remains at the table till the nearest relation of the deceased comes up and deposits an Obituary Offering. If it be a person of consequence, the sum is a guinea or more ; if a farmer or tradesman, a crown; if a poor man, six-pence : the next of kin then follow the example, offering sometimes as much, and sometimes less than the first : the rest of the congregation, who intend to offer silver, follow, when a solemn pause ensues ; and the rest of the congregation offer pence : but pence are never offered at genteel funerals. The offerings on these occasions frequently amount to eight or ten pounds.<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Those</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Caernarvon</span> <span class="pre">amount</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">little</span> <span class="pre">short</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">one</span> <span class="pre">hundred</span> <span class="pre">pounds</span> <span class="pre">per</span> <span class="pre">annum.]</span></code> This is certainly a relict of Popery, and was no doubt formerly intended as an acknowledgement to the priest for praying for the welfare of the departed soul ; as a composition for a short residence in purgatory; or perhaps for any failure in the payment of tythes and oblations, and is termed <em>Arian Rhiew</em>.

<p>Next up comes William Bingley’s <em>North Wales; including its scenery, antiquities, customs, and some sketches of its natural history, delineated from two excursions through all the interesting parts of that country, during the summers of 1798 and 1801</em>, and published, in two volumes, in 1804.</p>
<p>In the <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/northwalesinclud02bing/page/278/mode/2up">second volume</a>, p279, as part of a section on the <em>The Manners and Customs of the Welsh</em>, Bingley also picks up on the ritual identified by Pennant of a wronged person calling on St Aeilian to curse someone who has wronged them:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A strange custom prevails in some obscure parts of North Wales, which, however, the clergy have now almost abolished. This is termed the “offering of an enemy.” When a person supposes himself highly injured by any one, he repairs to some church dedicated to a celebrated saint, or one who is believed to have great power over the affairs of men ; here kneeling on his bare knees before the altar, and offering a piece of money to the saint, he utters the most virulent and dreadful imprecations, calling down curses and misfortunes on the offender and his family even for generations to come. Sometimes the offended persons repair for the same purpose to some sacred well, dedicated to a saint. Mr. Pennant was threatened by a man, who fancied he had been injured by him, “with the vengeance of St. Elian, and a journey to his well, to curse him with effect.” [Tour in Wales, ii. 337.]</p>

<p class="admonition-title">The Greyhounds, Gelert, or St. Guinefort</p>
<p>When searching for “saint” and “greyhound”, I kept finding myself discovering another story, that appears in several forms. Variously, the Welsh tradition of a greyhound called Gelert, and a French tradition of St. Guinefort, also a greyhound. Both stories essentially tell the same tale.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/historyofwaleswr00carauoft/page/n309/mode/2up?q=+greyhound">https://archive.org/details/historyofwaleswr00carauoft/page/n309/mode/2up?q=+greyhound</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“At a period when wolves were so formidable and numerous in Wales, Llewelyn the Great came to reside here for the hunting season, with his princess and children ; but while the family were one day absent, a wolf entered into the house and attempted to kill an infant that was left asleep in the cradle. The prince’s favourite greyhound, called Gelert (given him by King John in 1205), that was watching by the side,, seized the rapacious animal and killed it, but in the struggle the cradle was overturned, and lay upon the wolf and child. On the prince’s return, missing the infant, and observing the dog’s mouth stained with blood, he immediately concluded Gelert had murdered the child, and in a paroxysm of rage drew his sword and ran the faithful animal through the heart ; but how great was his astonishment when, on replacing the cradle, he found the wolf dead and his child alive. He, however, caused the grateful creature to be honour- ably interred, and, as a monument to his memory, erected a church on the spot, as a grateful offering to God for the preservation of his child.”</p>

</div>
<p>We note that Pennant’s <em>Tour in Wales</em> is cited, but it is not clear from where the detail of the additional information, such as the phrase the “offering of the enemy”, the kneeling ritual, and the monetary payment are sourced from.</p>
<p>On the previous page, a reference is made to a seemingly deep-seated belief that does not bear directly on the tradition of the “sin eater” as we have this far seen it described, but that does often appear in descriptions of Welsh folklore relating to funerals and death, <em>the corpse candle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is an opinion very prevalent within the diocese of St. David’s in Pembrokeshire, that a short time previous to the death of a person, a light is some-times seen to proceed from the house, and even from the bed, and to pursue its way to the church where the body is to be interred, precisely in the same track that the funeral will afterwards follow. This light is call <em>canwyll corph</em>, or “the corpse candle.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A little further on, on p. 285-6, we see some more ingredients that resemble the sin-eater tradition, <em>almost</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A custom prevails in this country of each individual of the congregation making some <em>offering</em> in money on these occasions, which, if done in the church, is paid as a mark of respect to the clergyman. This custom, which is at present confined to North Wales, has doubtless been retained from the Romish religion, where the money was intended as a recompence to the priests for their trouble in singing mass for the soul of the deceased. In some cases, where the clergyman is not respected by his parishioners, the <em>offerings</em> are made on the coffin at the door of the house where the deceased resided, and are distributed amongst the poor relatives.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The tradition is associated with <em>North</em> Wales, and involves a payment supposedly made to a priest recalling payments made to “Romish” priests for services rendered in saying mass for a departed soul. However, where the disliked, the offering may be given to the poor, although again there seems to be no expectation of them taken the sins of the departed upon themselves.</p>
<p>On the following pages, p287-8, we hear of another North Walian tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is usual in several parts of North Wales, for the nearest female relation to the deceased, be she widow, mother, sister, or daughter, to pay some poor person, of the same sex, and nearly of the same age with the deceased, for procuring slips of yew, box, and other evergreens, to strew over and ornament the grave for some weeks after interment ; and in some instances for weeding and adorning it, on the eves of Easter, Whitsuntide, and the other great festivals, for a year or two afterwards. This gift is called <em>Diodlys</em>, and it is made on a plate at the door of the house, where at the same time the body is standing on a bier.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So here we have a payment to a poor person for a service rendered in terms of paying respects to the grave for the week following an interment. It is not clear from this fragment what the role played by the offerings — <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yew,</span> <span class="pre">box,</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">other</span> <span class="pre">evergreens</span></code> – actually is.</p>
<p>The custom identified by Pennant then makes an appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It had its name from the custom, which is now discontinued, of the female relative giving to the person a piece of cheese with the money stuck in it, some white bread, and afterwards a cup of ale. — When this previous ceremony is over, the clergyman, or, in his absence, the parish clerk, repeats the Lord’s prayer ; after which they proceed with the body to the church. Four of the next of kin take the bier upon their shoulders ; a custom which is considered as expressive of the highest mark that even filial piety can pay to the deceased. If the distance from the house to the church be considerable, they are relieved by some of the congregation ; but they always take it again before they arrive at the church. — I have been informed that in some parts of the country it is usual to set the bier down at every cross-way, and again when they enter the church-yard, and at each of these places to repeat the Lord’s prayer.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>What we should take away from this, perhaps, is the word <em>Diodlys</em> as somehow referencing or describing elements of this tradition; and the apparent confusion over whether this tradition is to be found in North or South Wales.</p>

<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/antiquarianreper02gros/page/n321/mode/2up?q=jorevin">Volume II</a> of a “new edition” of <em>The Antiquarian repertory : a miscellaneous assemblage of topography, history, biography, customs, and manners ; intended to illustrate and preserve several valuable remains of old times</em> by Francis Grose and Thomas Astle, published in 1775, the authors quote widely from an account Monsieur Jorevin de Rocheford’s 17th century travels in England, Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p>On <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/antiquarianreper02gros/page/102/mode/2up?q=SCHROSBERY">p100-102</a>, Jorevin describes his travels through Shrewsbury, which includes an account of a funeral there. The account opens with a description of his initial thoughts on entering Shrewsbury:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>SCHROSBERY.</p>
<p>The Severn is navigable to Schrosbery, I passed it over a large stone bridge,
at the entrance there is a suburb, the church of which appears to me to have formerly belonged to some fine abbey. I ascended from thence to the town, which is mounted on the platform of a rock, scarped on almost every side, which renders its situation naturally strong; besides which, the wall that encloses it made it difficult to be scaled ; the environs consist of large woods and high mountains, nevertheless this town is filled with people and rich shop-keepers, who dwell in two large streets, one leading to the market, place, and the other turning from this place towards the left. Near which are the Great Church, the Exchange, and Town-hall, they are in a street called Aystrit [High Street], which is so broad that it seems a long market-place, terminating at one of the ends of the town, where stands the Castle and commands it, being more elevated, and by so much the stronger as it is environed on one side by broad ditches, closed with good walls, and on the other there is no approach to it, on account of the steepness of the rock, but it has been ruined by the late wars, in so much that excepting a few towers and some lodgings within, I see nothing remarkable.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The account then describes a funeral ceremony he encountered; there is no particular mention of the pre-funereal rite, such as the sin-eating ceremony, although there does appear to be a tradition of placing jug of wine on the coffin from which everyone in attendance can drink the health of the deceased:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I met nothing more pleasing to me than the funeral ceremonies at the interment of a My Lord, which mine host procured me the fight of. The relations and friends being assembled in the house of the defunct, the minister advanced into the middle of the chamber, where, before the company, he made a funeral oration, representing the great actions of the deceased, his virtues, his qualities, his titles of nobility, and those of the whole family, so that nothing more could be said towards consoling every one of the company for the great loss they had sustained in this man, and principally the relations who were seated round the dead body, and whom he assured that he was gone to heaven, the seat of all sorts of happiness, whereas the world that he had just left was replete with misery. It is to be remarked, that during this oration there stood upon the coffin a large pot of wine, out of which every one drank to the health of the deceased, hoping that he might surmount the difficulties he had to encounter in his road to Paradise, where, by the mercy of God, he was about to enter, on which mercy they founded all their hope, without considering their evil life, their wicked religion, and that God is just.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The account then describes the funeral procession and interment:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This being finished, six men took up the corps and carried it on their shoulders to the church ; it was covered with a large cloth, which the four nearest relations held each by a corner with one hand, and in the other carried a bough; the other relations and friends had in one hand a flambeau, and in the other a bough, marching thus through the street, without singing, or saying any prayer, till they came to the church, where having placed the body on tressels and taken off the cloth from the coffin, which is ordinarily made of fine walnut-tree, handsomely worked and ornamented with iron bandages, chafed in the manner of a buffet. The minister then ascended his pulpit, and every one being seated round about the coffin, which is placed in a kind of parade in the middle of the church, he read a portion of the Holy Scripture concerning the resurrection of the dead, and afterwards sang some psalms, to which all the company answered. After this he descended, having his bough in his hand like the rest of the congregation ; this he threw on the dead body when it was put into the grave, as did all the relations, extinguishing their flambeaus in the earth with which the corps was to be covered. This finished, every one retired to his home without farther ceremony, and I departed from Schrosbury for Chester, and having passed over a large desart plain, I reached Addar, Morton, and a Castle. The country here is barren ; passed a river near a windmill ; from thence to Pries and Vitechurch on a river. Here is a manufactory of woollen cloth. The road lies afterwards over some mountains, where are several good inns all alone ; Empost is one. Came to Anlai, and some small woods, having the river on the right, which runs to Chester.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Aubrey Quoted via <em>Popular Antiq.</em> in <em>Archaeological Sketches</em></p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>The following are matters which the author ascribes to the middle ages, at least he can assign no earlier date.</p>
<p>The first is the singular custom, now obsolete, of <em>Sin-eating</em>.</p>
<p>It appears, that so late as the seventeenth century, there was in the villages, adjoining to Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul departed; Ellis, the editor of the Popular Antiquities has extracted the following curious passage from the Lansdowne Manuscripts, concerning a <em>Sin-eater</em>, who “lived in a cottage, on Rosse highway.”</p>
<p>“In the county of Hereford was an old custom at Funerals to hire poor people, who were to take upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of them (he was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor Rascal) I remember lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the Corps was brought out of the house, and layd in the Biere, a loafe of bread was brought out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the Corps, as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer [which he was to drink up] and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof lie took upon him, <em>ipso facto</em>, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead. This custome alludes methinks, something to the Scape-Goate in the old lawe, Levit. chap. xvi. v. 21, 22. ” And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their: transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goate, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness. And the Goate shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall let the Goate goe into the wilderness,”</p>
<p>This custome (though rarely used in our day,) yet by some people was observed, even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the Parish) the kindred of a woman deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according to her will; and also the like was done at the city of Hereford in those times, where a woman kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowle for the Sinne-eater; and the like in other places in this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this custom was heretofore used all over Wales. [Popular Antiq. ii. 156.]</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p id="gnlmn-sin-eater">The fragment regarding sin-eating also appears on pp.222-3 of <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_gentlemans-magazine_1822-03_92/page/222/mode/2up"><em>The Gentleman’s Magazine</em> 1822-03: Vol 92</a>, in a column on <em>Popular Customs and Superstitions in Herefordshire. [From Mr. Fosbroke’s “Ariconensia.”]</em>, p220-223, continued from earlier in that volume.</p>
<p>Although probably relevant to our story, there is also mention, again via Popular Antiquities, of a custom involving the casting of half-eater bread in the path of wedding party by a “deserted female”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Formerly flowers were strewed before young couples, in their way to church. The author once saw a malicious caricature of this custom. Nosegays of rue enclosing a piece of half-eaten bread and butter were dropt in the church-path and porch by a deserted female, in order to denote an unhappy wedding. Stephens, in his plaine Country Bridegroom, p. 353, says “He shews neere affinity betwixt Marriage and Hanging ; and to that purpose, he provides a great Nosegay, and shakes hands with every one he meets, as if he were now preparing for a condemned man’s voyage. [Popular Antiq. ii. 48]</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the hands of a storyteller, however, we might be able to weave a story that develops the notion of “half-eaten” bread, perhaps suggesting that not even a sin-eater would absolve the groom of the sin of spurning a woman he was perhaps previously betrothed to!</p>

<p>However, the observations actually appear to come from Ellis’ edited version of <em>Popular Antiquities</em>, the full titleof which we may recall is <em>Observations on the popular antiquities of Great Britain: Including the Whole of Mr. Bourne’s <strong>Antiquitates Vulgares</strong></em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The “Vulgar Errors” of Browne, with the interesting notes and additions of Mr. Ellis, recently published, furnish us with a curious detail of the various customs formerly observed at deaths, and several of which are yet retained in different parts of England. The article, as given in the work, is prolix, and contains some extraneous matter, which we think might have been omitted with advantage. In the following extracts we have selected only the parts most entertaining: they are ranged under several heads, as— “The Passing-Bell,” “Watching The Dead,” “Setting Salt or Candles on the Body,” “The carrying of Torches and Lights,” “Funeral Sermons,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>This sections all appear under the same name, and in related form, in <em>Popular Antiquities</em>.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">The Passing Bell (or “Soul Bell”)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The PASSING BELL, so called from its denoting the passing or departing of any one from life to death, was originally intended to invite the prayers of the faithful for the person who was dying, but was not yet dead ; and though in some instances superstitiously used, has its meaning clearly pointed out in a clause in the “Advertisements for Due Order,” &amp;c. in the seventh year of Queen Elizabeth, which enjoins “that when anye Christian bode is <em>in passing</em>, that the <em>bell be toled</em>, and that the Curate be speciallie called for to comfort the sicke person ; and <em>after the time of his passing</em>, to ring no more but one short peale; and one before the buriall, and another short peale after the buriail.” Grose, referring to the old Catholic belief on this subject, treats it rather ludicrously, though its intention, as just duscribed, was evidently serious. “The Passing Bell,” says he, “was anciently rung for two purposes; one to bespeak the prayers of all good Christians for a soul just departing ; the other, to drive away the evil spirits who stood at the bed’s foot, and about the house ready to seize their prey, or at least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage ; but by the ringing of that bell (for Durandus, a writer of the twelfth century, inform us evil spirits are much afraid of bells) they were kept aloof; and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained the start, or had what is; by sportsmen, called law.”</p>
<p>In the diary of Robert Birrel, preserved in “Fragments of Scottish History,” &amp;c. is the following curious entry :- “1566, the 25 of October, word came to the towne of Edinburghe, from the Queine, yat hir Majestie was deadly seike, and desirit ye bells to be runge, and all ye peopile to resort to ye Kirk to pray for her, for she was so seike that none lepsied her life” (expected her to live.) Bourne supposes, that from the saying mentioned by Bede, “Lord have mercy on my soul,” which St. Oswald uttered when he fell to the earth, has been derived the distich so often introduced in ballads on the melancholy occasion of a coming execution:–</p>
<p>“When the bell begins to toll,
LORD have mercy on my soul!”</p>
<p>In a very rare book entitled “Wits, Fits, and Fancies,” (1614) the author relates a droll anecdote concerning the ringing out at the burial of “a rich churle and a begger who were buried at one time, in the same churchyard, and the bells rang out amaine for the miser. Now the wiseacre, his son, and executor,” says he, “to the ende the worlde might not thinke that all that ringing was for the begger, but for his father, hyred a trumpetter to stand all the ringing while in the belfrie, and between every peak, to sound his trumpet, and proclame aloud and saye, sirres, this next peale is not for R, but for maister N,-,his father.” There seems to be nothing more intended at present by tolling the Passing Bell, but to inform the neighbourhood of some person’s death.</p>
<p>The Jews used trumpets instead of bells. The Turks do not permit the use of them at all. The Greek Church under their dominion still follow her old custom of using wooden boards, or iron plates full of holes, which they hold in their hands and knock with a hammer or mallet, to call the people to church. China has been remarkably famous for its bells. Father Le Compte tells us, that at Pekin, there are seven bells, each of which weighs 120,000 lbs.</p>

<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Watching With The Dead (“Wakes”, “wyl nos”)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>WATCHING WITH THE DEAD.—This is called in the North of England the <em>Lake Wake</em>, a name plainly derived from the Anglo-Saxon <em>lic</em> or <em>lice</em>, a corpse, and <em>waece</em> or <em>wake</em>, a vigil or watching. It is used, in this sense by Chaucer, in his “Knight’s Tale :”</p>
<p>“Shall not be told by me
How that arcite is brent to ashen cold,
Ne how that there the Liche-wake was y-hold
All that night long.”</p>
<p>Pennant, in describing Highland ceremonies. says, “The Late Wake is a ceremony used at funerals. The evening after the death of any one, the relation or friends of the deceased meet at the house, attended by a bagpipe or fiddle, tbe nearest of kin, be it wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting— that is, crying violently at the same time ; and this continues till daylght, but with such gambols and frolics among the younger part of the company, that the loss which occasions their meeting, is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corpse remain unburied for two nights, the same rites are renewed. Thus, Scythiau-like, they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery.” The custom in North Wales, we are informed by the same writer, is, “the night before a dead body is to be interred, the friends and neighbours of the deceased resort to the house the corpse is in, bringing with them some small present, of bread, meat, and drink (if the family be something poor), but more especially candles, whatever the family be, and this night is called <em>wyl nos</em>, whereby the country people seem to mean a watching night. Their going to such a house, they say, is <em>i wilior corph</em>, to watch the corpse ; but <em>wylo</em> signifies to weep and, lament, and so <em>wyl nos</em> may be a night of lamentation. While they stay together on that night, they are either singing psalms, or reading some part of the Holy Scriptures. Whenever any body comes into a room where a dead body lies, especially on the <em>wyl nos</em>, and the day of its interment, the first thing he does, he falls on his. knees by the corpse and says the Lord’s Prayer.”</p>
<p>The “Irish Hudibras” (1689) humorously describes an Irish wake—</p>
<p>“To their own sports (the Masses ended)
The mourners now are recommended.
Some sit and chat, some laugh, some weep,
Some sing <em>cronans</em>, and some do sleep;
Some court, some scold, some blow, some puff,
Some take tobacco, some take snuff.
Some play the trump, some trot the hay,
Some at <em>machan</em> [a game of cards] , some noddy play:
Thus mixing up their grief and sorrow,
Yesterday buried kill’d to-morrow.”</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Laying Out, or “Streeking”</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>LAYING OUT, OR STREEKING THE BODY.— Durand, at the remote period at which he lived, gives a pretty exact account of some of the ceremonies used at laying out the body, as practised at pment in the north of England, where the laying out is called <em>streeking</em>. He mentions the closing of the eyes, the decent washing, dressing and wrapping up in a clean winding-sheet, or linen shroud, as well as other anciont observances. The interests of our woollen manufacture have interfered with this ancient rite in England. To the laying out may be added the very old custom of <em>setting salt</em>, and placing a lighted candle upon the body, both which are used to this day in some parts of Northumberland. The salt, a little of which is set in a pewter plate upon the corpse, is, according to the learned Morex, an emblem of eternity and immortality. It is not liable to putrefaction itself, and preserves other things that are seasoned with it from decay. The lighted candle, the same author conjectures to have been the Egyptian hieroglyphic for life.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The extract also includes Aubrey’s (now familiar to us) description of the sin-eater of the Ross highway:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Aubrey, in some miscellanies of his, among the Lansdown MSS., at the British Museum, mentions a very curious custom at deaths, observed in a degree until his time (reign of Charles II), which he describes - under the name of <em>Sin-Eaters</em>. “In the County of Hereford,” says he, “was an old custome at Funeralls, to hire poor people, who were to take upon-them the sinnes of the party deceased. One of theme (he was a long lean ugly lumentable raskal), I remember, lived in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when the corpse was brought out of the house, and layed on the biere, a loafe of bread was brought out and delivered to the sinne eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl, of maple, full of beere (which lie was to drink up), and sixpence in money : in consideration he took upon him, <em>ipso facto</em>, all the the sinnes of defunct, and freed him or her from walking after they were dead.” This custom, he supposes, had some allusion to the scape-goat under the Mosaical law.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<span class="target" id="index-5"></span><p id="eulogy-creswell">Finally, we have a rather humourous story of the elegy given to an apparently renouned procuress, <em>Mother Creswell</em> in the mid-seventeenth century:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>FUNERAL SERMONS.— Speaking of the frequency of these formerly, and their present disuse :— “Even such a character as the infamous Mother <em>Creswell</em>, the procuress in the reign of Charles II,” our author observes, “must have her Funeral Sermon.” She, according to Granger, desired by will to have a sermon preached at her funeral, for which the preacher was to have 10l., but upon the express condition that he only spoke well of her. A preacher was with some difficulty found, who undertook the task. He, after a sermon preached on the general subject of morality, and the good uses to be made of it, concluded by saying— ‘By the will of the deceased, it is expected I should mention her, and say nothing but what is <em>well</em> of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this :— she was born well, she lived well, and she died well, for she was born with the name of Creswell, she lived in Clerkenwell, and she died in Bridewell.”</p>

For one thing, said the minister, this man is to be spoken well of by all ; and, for another thing, he is to be spoken ill of by none. The first is because God made him, the second, because he is dead.” Granger’s Biogr. Hist. of England, 8vo- Lond. 1775. vol. iv. p. 218.</p>

<p>This infamous woman was, from the natural effects of prostitution in her youth, far advanced in the decline before she had arrived at the meridian of her life. Her great experience in her former occupation qualified her for a procuress ; aud she soon became an adept in all the diabolical arts of seduction. She lived in town in the winter, and sometimes retired into the country, where she provided convenient lodgings for her customers, some of whom were persons of distinction. Though she appeared in her real character in the stews, (she could assume a very decent behaviour upon proper occasions ; and frequently decoyed young unsuspecting girls to London, in hopes of preferment. She kept a very extensive correspondence, and was by her spies and emissaries, informed of the rising beauties in different parts of the kingdom. The trade which she professed was perhaps carried to a greater height at this period than any other. This is plainly hinted at by a man of wit and pleasure, who sometimes dealt with her:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Id vero est, quod ego mihi puto palmarium,<br />
Me reperisse, quomodo adolescentulus
Meretricum ingenia et mores possit noscere:
Mature ut cum cognórit perpetuo oderit.</p>
<p>Ter. Eun. Act. 5, Sc. 4.</p>
<p>No Vice or Wickedness which People fall into from Indulgence to Desires which are natural to all, ought to place them below the Compassion of the virtuous Part of the World; which indeed often makes me a little apt to suspect the Sincerity of their Virtue, who are too warmly provoked at other Peoples personal Sins. The unlawful Commerce of the Sexes is of all other the hardest to avoid; and yet there is no one which you shall hear the rigider Part of Womankind speak of with so little Mercy. It is very certain that a modest Woman cannot abhor the Breach of Chastity too much; but pray let her hate it for her self, and only pity it in others. Will. Honeycomb calls these over-offended Ladies, the Outragiously Virtuous.</p>
<p>I do not design to fall upon Failures in general, with relation to the Gift of Chastity, but at present only enter upon that large Field, and begin with the Consideration of poor and publick Whores. The other Evening passing along near Covent-Garden, I was jogged on the Elbow as I turned into the Piazza, on the right Hand coming out of James-street, by a slim young Girl of about Seventeen, who with a pert Air asked me if I was for a Pint of Wine. I do not know but I should have indulged my Curiosity in having some Chat with her, but that I am informed the Man of the Bumper knows me; and it would have made a Story for him not very agreeable to some Part of my Writings, though I have in others so frequently said that I am wholly unconcerned in any Scene I am in, but meerly as a Spectator. This Impediment being in my Way, we stood under one of the Arches by Twilight; and there I could observe as exact Features as I had ever seen, the most agreeable Shape, the finest Neck and Bosom, in a Word, the whole Person of a Woman exquisitely Beautiful. She affected to allure me with a forced Wantonness in her Look and Air; but I saw it checked with Hunger and Cold: Her Eyes were wan and eager, her Dress thin and tawdry, her Mein genteel and childish. This strange Figure gave me much Anguish of Heart, and to avoid being seen with her I went away, but could not forbear giving her a Crown. The poor thing sighed, curtisied, and with a Blessing, expressed with the utmost Vehemence, turned from me. This Creature is what they call newly come upon the Town, but who, I suppose, falling into cruel Hands was left in the first Month from her Dishonour, and exposed to pass through the Hands and Discipline of one of those Hags of Hell whom we call Bawds. But lest I should grow too suddenly grave on this Subject, and be my self outragiously good, I shall turn to a Scene in one of Fletcher’s Plays, where this Character is drawn, and the Œconomy of Whoredom most admirably described. The Passage I would point to is in the third Scene of the second Act of The Humorous Lieutenant. Leucippe who is Agent for the King’s Lust, and bawds at the same time for the whole Court, is very pleasantly introduced, reading her Minutes as a Person of Business, with two Maids, her Under-Secretaries, taking Instructions at a Table before her. Her Women, both those under her present Tutelage, and those which she is laying wait for, are alphabetically set down in her Book; and as she is looking over the Letter C, in a muttering Voice, as if between Soliloquy and speaking out, she says,</p>
<p>Her Maidenhead will yield me; let me see now;<br />
She is not Fifteen they say: For her Complexion—-<br />
Cloe, Cloe, Cloe, here I have her,<br />
Cloe, the Daughter of a Country Gentleman;<br />
Here Age upon Fifteen. Now her Complexion,<br />
A lovely brown; here ’tis; Eyes black and rolling,<br />
The Body neatly built; she strikes a Lute well,<br />
Sings most enticingly: These Helps consider’d,<br />
Her Maidenhead will amount to some three hundred,<br />
Or three hundred and fifty Crowns, ’twill bear it handsomly.<br />
Her Father’s poor, some little Share deducted,<br />
To buy him a Hunting Nag—</p>
<p>These Creatures are very well instructed in the Circumstances and Manners of all who are any Way related to the Fair One whom they have a Design upon. As Cloe is to be purchased with 350 Crowns, and the Father taken off with a Pad; the Merchant’s Wife next to her, who abounds in Plenty, is not to have downright Money, but the mercenary Part of her Mind is engaged with a Present of Plate and a little Ambition. She is made to understand that it is a Man of Quality who dies for her. The Examination of a young Girl for Business, and the crying down her Value for being a slight Thing, together with every other Circumstance in the Scene, are inimitably excellent, and have the true Spirit of Comedy; tho’ it were to be wished the Author had added a Circumstance which should make Leucippe’s Baseness more odious.</p>
<p>It must not be thought a Digression from my intended Speculation, to talk of Bawds in a Discourse upon Wenches; for a Woman of the Town is not thoroughly and properly such, without having gone through the Education of one of these Houses. But the compassionate Case of very many is, that they are taken into such Hands without any the least Suspicion, previous Temptation, or Admonition to what Place they are going. The last Week I went to an Inn in the City to enquire for some Provisions which were sent by a Waggon out of the Country; and as I waited in one of the Boxes till the Chamberlain had looked over his Parcel, I heard an old and a young Voice repeating the Questions and Responses of the Church-Catechism. I thought it no Breach of good Manners to peep at a Crevice, and look in at People so well employed; but who should I see there but the most artful Procuress in the Town, examining a most beautiful Country-Girl, who had come up in the same Waggon with my Things, Whether she was well educated, could forbear playing the Wanton with Servants, and idle fellows, of which this Town, says she, is too full: At the same time, Whether she knew enough of Breeding, as that if a Squire or a Gentleman, or one that was her Betters, should give her a civil Salute, she should curtsy and be humble, nevertheless. Her innocent forsooths, yes’s, and’t please you’s, and she would do her Endeavour, moved the good old Lady to take her out of the Hands of a Country Bumpkin her Brother, and hire her for her own Maid. I staid till I saw them all marched out to take Coach; the brother loaded with a great Cheese, he prevailed upon her to take for her Civilities to his Sister. This poor Creature’s Fate is not far off that of her’s whom I spoke of above, and it is not to be doubted, but after she has been long enough a Prey to Lust she will be delivered over to Famine; the Ironical Commendation of the Industry and Charity of these antiquated Ladies, these Directors of Sin, after they can no longer commit it, makes up the Beauty of the inimitable Dedication to the Plain-Dealer, and is a Masterpiece of Raillery on this Vice. But to understand all the Purleues of this Game the better, and to illustrate this Subject in future Discourses, I must venture my self, with my Friend Will, into the Haunts of Beauty and Gallantry; from pampered Vice in the Habitations of the Wealthy, to distressed indigent Wickedness expelled the Harbours of the Brothel.</p>

<p>Leave we now, Sir Lambert, a while, and let us rehearse what happen’d at the councel of safety, of which the Seer Warreston was chief president, who was a right notable knave, and exceeding salacious, as you shall understand by that which follows. There was a lady at that time, who had certain sad occasions to visit the councel of safety for the redress of certain grievances, but could never find a fit opportunity to deliver her supplication ; but at length finding that the Seer Warreston was all alone in the councel chamber, she prevail’d with money of the dore-keeper to let her in. When she came in, she appeared right comely unto the seer, and related her story unto him with such a grace, that he was straightway enamoured of her ; quoth he, ‘Well do you deserve, fair lady, to have your petition granted, but should I grant you your petition, would you grant me mine ?’ ‘Alas!’ said the lady, ‘it is not for you to petition, who have so much power in your hands.’ ‘Ah !’ replyed the seer, ‘you have wounded me ; and I hope you will cure the wound which you have made,’ and saying these words, he pulled her by the gown upon his knee, as he sate in his great chair, and would have kissed her. The lady, not ignorant how much coyness inflamed, made great resistance; but the more she resisted, the more was he on fire ; so that there was exceeding great contention and struggling between them ; at length the lustful seer being the stronger, had thrown her upon the councel table, and there laid her flat on her back, where at length she gave him leave to quench his desires with the spoils of her seeming chastity, on condition that he would grant her request. He had no sooner finished, but in came Sir Fleetwood the contemptible knight, and some others, who seeing the seer in a strange posture, with his band rumpled, his cap off, the sleeve of his gown torn, and his face more redder than ordinary, desired to know of him what had happened unto him. The seer not at all abashed, told them the whole story, who entered thereupon into great consultations among themselves. Some were of an opinion, that since the Seer Warestons genealogy was likely to increase, that the souldan should allow him a larger stipend. One stood up, and said it was requisite that the contemptible knight, and the knight of the allegories, should be sent to the temple of the gods, La potta del Papa Giovanna, to enquire of the oracle whether it were a boy or a girl, that provision for the birth and education might be made accordingly. Others were of opinion that ‘twas convenient to know what his name should be. This debate took up above a weeks time, with continual pro’s and con’s, and at length they concluded that, if it were a boy, he should be called by the name of young Finbrandus, and that he should be sent to the enchanted castle Newgate, to be bred up in all the secrets of that place, by the several gyants that frequented the castle ; but if it were a girle, that she should be delivered to witch Creswellia [Mother Cresswell was an infamous procuress of the time], to be taught all kind of sorceries and enchantments ; and so the councel was dismist for that time.</p>
