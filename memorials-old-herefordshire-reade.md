Mid-Lent Sunday has always been called " Mothering 
Sunday." It is still usual for children to visit their parents 
on that day, taking with them a cake called a Simnel cake. 

On Palm Sunday, the custom prevailed, as elsewhere, 
of bearing green withes, instead of palms, in commemora- 
tion of our Lord's entry into Jerusalem. The day is also 
celebrated in a curious manner at Hentland Church. " The 
churchwardens present to the clergyman and to each of 
the congregation a small cake, which is eaten within the 
church, as evidence of a desire to lay aside all enmities, 
and to prepare for the Easter festival. It would be 
interesting to trace the connection, if any, between this 
custom and the ancient practice of sin-eating. Formerly

a cup of beer accompanied each cake, but this part of 
the ceremony has now been abandoned." This custom 
was observed also at Sellack as late as 1867. 

The practice of " sin-eating " referred to, being peculiar 
to the Welsh border, was discontinued before the end of 
the seventeenth century. The following description of it, 
given in Brand's Antiquities, is taken from the Lansdowne 
manuscripts : — 

In the county of Hereford was an old custom at funeralls to hire 
poor people who were to take upon them the sins of the party deceased. 
One of them (he was a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal), I remem- 
ber, that in a cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that when a 
corpse was brought out and laid on the biere, a loaf of bread was brought 
out and delivered to the sin-eater over the corpse, as also a mazar bowl 
of maple, full of beer, which he was to drink up, and sixpence in money. 
In consideration whereof, he took upon him, ipso facto, all the sins of 
the defunct, and freed him or her from walking after death. This 
custom alludes, methinks, to something of the Scapegoat in the Levitical 
Law, and though rarely used in our days, yet by some people was 
observed even in the strictest time of the Presbyterian Government. . . 
The like was done in the city of Hereford in those times where a woman 
kept, many years before her death, a mazard bowl for the sinne eater. 

Another account says that the sin-eater " pronounced 
the ease and rest of the soul departed, for which he would 
pawn his own soul." 

Dr. Schuyler, in his book on Turkestan, describes 
a corresponding custom : — " In Ach Kurgan . . . 
he met an old man called an iskdcki, who made 
his living by taking upon himself the sins of the dead 
and devoting his life to prayer for their souls." 

Easter Sunday was called " Corn-showing Sunday." 
Master, mistress, and men went to the earliest wheat field 
with a plentiful supply of cake and old cyder ; taking 
wisps of straw in their hands, they marched across the 
field, singing : — 

Every step a reap, 
Every reap a sheaf, 
Every sheaf a loaf, 
And God send the master a good harvest.
