"Sin-Eating" in the Amman Valley.

DOES ANYONE KNOW OF IT?

To the Editor of the Amman Valley I Chronicle.

Sir,â€” Coming across a stray copy the Red Dragon" for March 1883, I find a reference therein to a Rev. Paxton Hood's book on Christmas Evans, the Preacher of Wild Wales," which contains an interesting reference to the Amman alley. According to the "Red Dragon" the Rev. Paxton Hood, dealing with folk-lore, states the superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to linger even now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Amman in Carmarthenshire. The meaning of this most singular superstition was that when a person died the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread on the breast of the deceased person; he then uttered an incantation over the bread after which he proceeded to eat it, thereby eating the sins of the dead person. This done, he received a fee of two and sixpence which we suppose was much more than many a preacher received for a long and painful service. Having received this he vanished as swiftly as possible, all the friends and relatives of the departed aiding his exit with blows and kicks, and other indications of their faith in the service he had rendered. A hundred years since and through the ages beyond that time we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere prevalent".

I do not know the date of the publication of the book referred to, but the "Red Dragon" says a "couple of years ago" (that is from 1883) which, of course, is well within the memory of many of the present inhabitants of the Valley. Many a time have I heard of the 'Sin-Eating" superstition but lever (and I have spent many happy years in the vale) have I heard of its ever being prevalent in Cwm-Aman (or rather Cwm-Amman). The Sin-Eater, if such ever existed, must have been "Yn ??ten gymeriad" (old character), but fail to find any reference to him in Trumor's interesting Hen ?rymeriadau Plwyf y Bettws." It is, however, a singular fact that often our acquaintance with things happening next door, so to say, is often the result of the observation of strangers. The Editor of the "Amman Valley Chronicle" will, I feel sure, be disposed to place its columns at the disposal of any one who can give proofs or disproofs of the existence of the custom referred to in the Vale of Amman, or in any other part of the Prncipality. Thanking you, yours, etc.,

AMMANIT.
