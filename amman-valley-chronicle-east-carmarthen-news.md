Sin- Eating" in the Amman Valley. OES ANYONT 9. KNOW OF IT? To the Editor of the Amman Vallcy I Chronicl c. J Sir,â€”Coming across a stray copy the Red Dragon" for March i83, I find a reference therein to le Rev. Paxton Hood's book on Christmas Evans, the Preacher Wild Wales," which contains an iteresting reference to the Amman alley. According to the" Red Pragoii" the Rev. Paxton Hood, saling with folk-lore, states the aperstition of the Sin-Eater is said > linger even now in the secluded ale of Cwm-Alrniwua in Carmar- lenshire. The meaning of this lost singular superstition was that 'hen a person died the friends sent )r the Sin-Eater of the district, ho, on his arrival, placed a plate of llt and bread on the breast of the eceased persOn4 he then uttered n incantation over the bread after rhich he proceeded to eat it, there- >y eating the -skis of the dead per- on. This done, he received a fee i two and sixpence which we sup- 'ose was much more than many a reaeher received for a long and ainful service. Having received his he vanished as swiftly as pos- ible, all the friends and relatives of he departed aiding his exit with olows and kicks, and other indica- ioiis of their faith in the service he tad rendered. A hundred years ince and through the ages beyond hat time we suppose this curious superstition was everywhere preva- ent- I do not know the date of the mblication of the book referred to, mt the Red Dragon" says a 'couple of years ago" (that is from .883) whch, of course, is well with- n the memory of many of the resent inhabitants of the Valley. Many a time have I heard of the 'Sin-Eating" superstition but lever (and I have spent many lappy years in the vale) have I leard of its ever being prevalent in 'wm-Aman (or rather Cwm- Vmman). The Sin-Eater, if such ver existed, must have been Yn ten gymeriad" (old character), but fail to find any reference to him ti Trumor's interesting Hen rymeriadau Plwyf v Bettws." It 4, however, a singular fact that ften our acquaintance with things appening next door, so to say, is ften the result of the observation f strangers. The Editor of the Amman Valley Chronicle" will, I lel sure, be disposed to place its Dlumns at the disposal of any one "lio can give proofs or disproofs of le existence of the custom referred > in the Vale of Amman, or in any cher part of the Prncipality. Thanking you, yours, etc., AMMAXIT. I
