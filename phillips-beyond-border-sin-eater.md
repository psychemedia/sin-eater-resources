Sin eater sineater




Hello there guys my name's Ceri Phillips at croeso  ar Dinefwr, welcome to Dinefwr. I'm here in front  
of the old ice house on the Dinefwr estate and I  thought it might be a great place in order to tell  
you a ghost story. Now a long long time ago there  was a tradition that is said to have originated  
here in Wales. Now this tradition to a modern  listener might sound a little bit macabre  
and even quite scary but back in the day it was  seen as a necessity that was the tradition of  
having a sin eater in the community. Now the  tradition went a little something like this,  
essentially if somebody in your family had died  you would call in a sin eater. The night before  
the funeral you would lay the body of the recently  deceased out preferably in its coffin or casket  
on a table in your home's largest room. You would  set up some candles and you would light them.  
You would then proceed in the evening before the  witching hour at midnight the night before the  
funeral to produce a poultry meal anything you  could spare - a bowl of cowl or broth maybe a  
slice of bread or two, and put it in a bowl  then you would get a cup of beer, small beer,  
something you could easily afford. Then you  would set it in front of the body on the table  
and some have even suggested that many put the  meal on the corpse itself. You would then sit  
and wait for the sin-eater to arrive and once you  heard the knock on the door you would let him in.  
He would enter the largest room of the house you  would do the necessary prayers whatever you'd like  
to send the body on its way and the sin  eater would start the ritual which involved  
the eating of the bread or the soup or the cawl  and the drinking of the beer while standing over  
the body. The sin-eater would then place the  bowl and the cup now empty onto the corpse.  
Now what did this ritual signify well the  sin eater quite literally in the minds of  
people back then who are highly superstitious  would be devouring the sins of the deceased.  
Thus allowing for them to enter the kingdom  of heaven with a clean bill of moral health.  
Now how were these sin eaters treated because this  was a necessity for the people back then to have  
in their community well given that they were so  full of not only the sins of your dead relative  
but everyone's dead relatives in the community  they were treated like pariahs forced to live  
outside of the community at the very edges  of the village or the town in all the rural  
areas of Wales and even in the counties across  Offa's Dyke on the Welsh marches of England.  
They were they had to live in hovels, in cottages  that were ramshackle and run down because no one  
could come and help them if they needed some  diy doing. These cottages and ramshackle hovels  
were quite often in forests like i'm standing in  now but in the case of the story i'm about to tell  
you it was up on a mountain side. This sin eater,  the sin eater of the Swansea valley of Cwmtawe  
lived on the Daryn mountain above the village of  Ystalyfera and this particular sin eater would  
consume the sins of all the deceased in the  whole of the Swansea valley. From Pontardawe  
up to the edge of the Brecon Beacons. So he was  particularly unclean in the eyes of the natives.  
He lived around 1850 and all the parents of the  valley would tell their children especially to  
stay away from the sin eater of Ystalyfera. You  couldn't even look at him and you must avert his  
eyes when he ventured forth into the community.  But 1850 the age of reason had already descended  
upon south Wales so many parents didn't believe  in such traditions, such was the case with the  
parents of Mog Bach, little Morgan. They didn't  believe in such frivolous superstitious nonsense  
they were people of reason, people of science  and they never told Mog Bach about the sin eater  
one day in the year of 1850 near Calan Gaer,  all Hallows Eve the sin eater ventured forth.  
Now he was used to the town being deserted  effectively because they knew he was walking down  
but this time he saw a little boy playing in a  garden of a cottage in the village so he walked up  
and he lent on the railings and he said, 'Shwmae  yn fachgen bach, hello there little boy. Pwy  
wyt ti? Who are you?' Now Mog Bach being a  confident and intelligent little boy said,  
'well Mog Bach i fi. Shwmae i'm little Morgan.'  The sin eater lent in even closer and said,  
'wyt ti'n gwybod pwy i fi? Do you know who  I am?' Mog Bach put his hands in his pockets  
and said well, 'ond roeddwn i'n meddwl fy mod  i'n nabod pawb, I thought i knew everybody.  
dwi erioed wedi cwrdd â chi, i've never met you.'  
The sin eater lent in even closer and said,  'fi yw'r dyn taffi, I am the toffee man.'  
Mog Bach looked confused he'd never heard  of such a thing as a toffee man he said,' 
beth ar y ddaear yw toffeeman, what on  earth is a toffee man?' The sin eater said,  
'well i fyny ar fynydd daryn, up on the daryn  mountain, mae gen i dŷ, i've got a house.
up in my house you will find all the toffees  and the sweets and the ice cream that are  
provided to all the shops in Wales ask lady  Llandyfi if you come up with me I promise you
If you come up with me you can have all the  sweets and the toffees and the ice cream  
you can fill your stomach with. Mog Bach  thought to himself this is too good to be true  
but he seemed like a nice man so he decided to  follow him and off the pair went. They went up  
the mountain road all the way up to the sin  eaters home now the sin eater made very sure  
that he stayed at least 10 steps in front of Mog  so when he went around the corner he could only  
be heard and that's all he would say is da iawn  Mog Bach well done little Mog come along. When  
Mog Bach got to the cottage he couldn't see  the sin eater anywhere but he thought there's  
no more houses up on the Daryn I may as well go  in. So he entered the little ramshackle cottage  
and the door slammed shut behind him he couldn't  see a thing it was dark a small [ __ ] of light  
coming through a boarded window seemed to show  that there was no sweets or toffees or cakes or  
ice cream but there was mountains of what looked  like silver coins. Mog Bach was shocked and said,
'I don't see any toffees i can't see  any sweets am i in the right place  
then from behind him the sin eater  jumped out and said,' don't run away
what i'm showing to you now is  all the money of the toffee man
if you do one little task for me you can get  all this money you can treat it like your  
own personal bank and buy as many sweets and  chocolates not just for you but for all your  
family and all your friends for the rest of your  life. And what he asked was this that little Mog  
just stayed a night in the sin eaters cabin and  had to leave just after breakfast then he could  
return the next day and he could use this as his  own personal bank well Mog Bach said i don't see  
any problem with this and he went up and prepared  for bed now Mog Bach had a terrible night's sleep  
full of awful nightmares he was in a cold  sweat and he had this sense of impending doom  
all the night through but eventually morning  came. He tramped down the stairs and said, 
he came down the stairs and he said right then  toffee man i'm off home i'll be back tomorrow  
for my money.' And just before he was about to  leave he saw the table in the middle of the room  
with the best breakfast spread a young boy could  imagine. Beautiful finely milled white bread  
the like of which he only thought the grandest  houses in Wales had, lovely fresh butter a bowl of  
porridge with winberries picked from the mountain  itself a real delicacy and above all else a bowl  
of beer. Now Mog Bach was a really young boy he  never had beer before but he thought i'm probably  
the richest guy in all of South Wales now I may  as well start living by a prince and he started  
eating. He had a bit of bread and he had a bowl  full of porridge to get through and he had a whole  
bowl of beer as well and started sipping at it he  had a whale of a time but one thing annoyed him.
a noise was it crunching or was it dragging  
he gave no mind to it and kept on eating  but the noise got louder and faster
well he thought it must be mice this is a  ramshackle old place that i'm going to treat  
like a bank and this is all silver money not notes  so they can't eat through it it's just rats and  
mice. And as he ate the noise got more intense and  quicker and quicker until he was on the last crumb  
of bread which he put into his mouth and then the  last drop of beer which he supped down and then  
the last spoonful of porridge and finally as he  put the last sweet little winbury into his mouth  
he heard, 'Duk!' A thump. And as he was  chewing the winbury he stood up from the table  
and looked at the floor and rolling towards  the door was the head of the toffee man.  
He was utterly shocked and jumped up from  his chair with a scream, 'arrhhh.' He looked  
under the table and he saw the body and  in his hands was a cheese cutting wire.
Now if this couldn't be bad enough all of a  sudden the door burst open and two figures  
burst into the house his parents who'd  been frantic looking for him all night  
long. His mother looked at the scene  and cried out, 'Fy mab fy mab, my son,  
my son,' and went to grab him but his father  held her back. He knew what was going on  
and said, 'we need to get the priest whatever that man said
keep it to yourself until the priest comes here.'  
Now it didn't take very long for the priest  to come up and he looked at the scene himself  
and with a tat and his arm around Mog's mother  said, 'i'm sorry the ritual's been done. Mog  
has absolved the sin eater of all of his sins as  he lays dead on the floor he's eaten them all up  
and is now the sin eater of the Swansea valley.  And so it went that Mog Bach became the sin eater  
and had to live in the sin eaters old dishevel  cabin until the day he died but what was worse  
is that the world moved on fewer and fewer people  believed the old tradition and so they forgot.  
He didn't get any richer than he already was  at the beginning, but he still had all the sins  
and he died a bitter and twisted and angry  old man and to this day as I was told by  
my nan in Ystalyfera you mustn't go up on the  Daryn mountain lest you come across the ghost  
of Mog Bach the last sin eater of the  Swansea valley where he will take you  
and trick you as he was once tricked  and you become the next Sin eater  
of Cwmtawe. Diolch yn fawr, thank you very  much and let's enjoy the rest of the festival
