THE WENDY HUT
LONG AGO STORIES

SIMON THE SIN EATER.

Simon lived about a hundred years ago and he longed to travel to the far corners of the earth. His home was in the heart of the country where all the old customs were still kept up. and when o.d Farmer Brook died the whole village went to his funeral. When the ceremony was over, Farmer Brook's son asked if anybody would eat his father's sins, and he looked towards the beggars who were waiting for the dole of bread which was to he distributed in memory of the old farmer.

Now Simon knew that the farmer had been a good man, and before any of the beggars could come forward he ran up to the grave side and said he would be sin-eater. His father was horrified, but Simon ate the slice bread which was supposed to contain all the farmer's sins, and was given a shilling.

"His sins cannot harm me," said Simon when his father thrashed him. "I'm not sure that they could really get into the bread."

When Simon attended another funeral and ate the sins afterwards, his parents decided that nothing could be done with such a boy who became known as Simon the Sin-eater.

"I am no worse for eating them," thought simon, "and I am collecting money to go to London."

By the time he was eighteen he had eaten so many sins that people would not have him in their homes. The girls, and even the young men, were afraid of him, and the old folk said he was very wicked.

"Perhaps I am," though Simon. "I will eat no more, but I will try to make atonement for the sins of all those whose bread I ate."

So he travelled to London, saw all the sights of the great city, and wondered what he should do to make atonement. He was gentle and kind, and people liked his serious face. One day when he was down at the docks he saw a transportation ship, sailing to Australia with gangs of convicts chained together, and he was horrified.

"Is there anybody to look after the souls of those poor men?" he asked the captain.

"No," was the reply. "They are all wicked and richly deserve their punishment."

"Perhaps they could be improved," said Simon. "I have eaten sins since I was fourteen, and now I will atone for them if you will take me on board and let me help these wretched men."

"If you can prevent them from fighting and breaking up the ship, you will be well worth your keep," smiled the captain. "Come and try. At least you have a good and beautiful face!"

So Simon went, and by the time he had made three voyages everybody travelling to Australia had heard of Simon the Missionary, the man who did good. All his life he worked among the convict settlers of Australia and was loved and honoured in his new land.
