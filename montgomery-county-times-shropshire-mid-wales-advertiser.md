SIN-EATERS" IN WALES. In the anthropological section of the British Association, which held its meetings at Ipswich last week, Captain L. S. Hinde on Saturday gave a description of some cannibals in the Congo dis- trict and their customs. In the discussion which followed Mr. E. S. Hartland (Gloucester) thought there were traces of the old custom of eating the dead to be found, not merely in Europe, but in our own country. In Upper Bavaria when a dead man was laid out, the first thing was to bake a corpse cake of ordinary flour. The. cake was put on the breast of the dead "to rise," and was s^yposed to absorb the virtues of the deceased. It was after- wards eaten by the nearest relatives. In the Balkan Peninsula an image of the dead was carried in the procession, and was eaten at the tomb, the relatives praying "God rest him!" In our own country there were traces of these customs. In Wales there was within the recollection of men still living the sin eater." John Aubrey, who lived at the time of Charles II., and was a cele- brated antiquary, witnessed this ceremony at Ross, in the county of Hereford. Aubrey described the man, who was a paid sin-eater," as a long, lean, lamentably poor rascal." It was the practice for a relative, usually a woman, to put on the breast of the dead a quantity of bread, cheese, and beer. The" sin-eater" was expected to consume these things, and then pronounce the everlasting rest of the departed. It was believed that in doing this he absolutely ate and appropriated to himself the sins of the deceased. The "sin-eater" was give. sixpence for his trouble, and took care to get out of people's sight as soon as he could. This practice was said to have existedlin the neighbourhood of Swansea as recently as 1851, but the sin-eater'slprice had then risen to half a crown. Probably the greater part of the human race had passed through this phase I of cannibalism, and it was perhaps a necessary phase of the evolution of human civilisation.
