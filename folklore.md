THE  SIN -EATER. 


THE  earliest  mention  of  the  curious  custom  of  the  Sin- 
eater,  formerly  observed  in  Wales  and  the  Welsh 
Marches  at  funerals,  is  found  in  TJie  Reniaines  of  Goitilisinc 
and  Jiidaisine^  a  work  of  John  Aubrey,  which  remained  in 
manuscript  for  two  hundred  years,  until  it  was  for  the  first 
time  issued  by  the  Folk-lore  Society  ten  or  twelve  years 
ago.     The  passages  in  question  run  as  follows : 

Offertories  at  funeralls. 

These  are  mentioned  in  the  Rubrick  of  y*  ch.  of  Engl.  Cofnon- 
Prayer-booke  :  but  I  never  sawe  it  used,  but  once  at  Beaumaris,  in 
Anglesey  ;  but  it  is  used  over  all  the  Counties  of  North- Wales. 
But  before  when  the  corps  is  brought  out  of  Doores,  there  is  Cake 
&  Cheese,  and  a  new  Bowie  of  Beere,  and  another  of  Milke 
with  y'  Anno  Dni  ingraved  on  it,  &  y'  parties  name  deceased, 
w"*"  one  accepts  of  on  the  other  side  of  y^  Corps  ;  &  this  Custome 
is  used  to  this  day,  1686,  in  North  Wales.    [.  .  .  .

It  seems  a  remainder  of  this  custom  w'^''  lately  obtained  at 
Amersden,  in  the  county  of  Oxford,  where  at  the  burial  of  every 
corps  one  Cake  and  one  flaggon  of  Ale  just  after  the  interrment 
were  brought  to  the  minister  in  the  Ch.  porch.     W.  K.]^

146  The  Sin-Eater. 


Sinne-eaters. 

In  the  County  of  Hereford  was  an  old  Custome  at  funeralls  to 

<  ,         [  poor  people,  who  were  to  take  upon  them  all  the  sinnes  of 

the  party  deceased.  One  of  them  I  remember  lived  in  a  Cottage 
on  Rosse-high  way.  (He  was  a  long,  leane,  ugly,  lamentable  poor 
raskal.)  The  manner  was  that  when  the  Corps  was  brought  out 
of  the  house  and  layd  on  the  Biere ;  a  Loafe  of  bread  was 
brought  out,  and  delivered  to  the  Sinne-eater  over  the  corps, 
as  also  a  Mazar-bowle  of  maple  (Gossips  bowle)  full  of  beer,  w"*" 
he  was  to  drinke  up,  and  sixpence  in  money,  in  consideration 
whereof  he  tooke  upon  him  (ipso  facto)  all  the  Sinnes  of  the 
Defunct,  and  freed  him  (or  her)  from  walking  after  they  were 
dead.  This  custome  alludes  (methinkes)  something  to  the  Scape- 
goate  in  y*  old  La  we.  Leviticus,  cap.  xvi,  verse  21,  22.  "And 
Aaron  shall  lay  both  his  hands  on  the  head  of  the  live  goate  and 
confesse  over  him  all  y*"  iniquities  of  the  children  of  Israel,  and  all 
their  transgressions  in  all  their  sins,  putting  them  upon  the  head 
of  the  goat,  and  shall  send  him  away  by  the  hand  of  a  fitt 
man  into  the  wildernesse.  And  the  goat  shall  bear  upon 
him  all  their  iniquities,  unto  a  land  not  inhabited:  and  he  shall 
let  the  goat  goe  unto  the  wildernesse."    This  Custome  (though 

rarely  used  in  our  dayes)  yet  by  some  people  was  \  .        ,1 

even  in  the  strictest  time   of  y"  Presbyterian  goverment :    as  at 

Dynder,  volens  nolens  the  Parson  of  y*  Parish,  the  <    '^"''f^"    I 
•^  (  relations  J 

of  a  woman  deceased  there  had  this  Ceremonie  punctually  per- 
formed according  to  her  Will :  and  also  the  like  was  donne  at  y' 
City  of  Hereford  in  these  times,  when  a  woman  kept  many  yeares 
before  her  death  a  Mazard-bowle  for  the  Sinne-eater;  and  the 
like  in  other  places  in  this  Countie;  as  also  in  Brecon,  e.g.  at 
Llangors,  where  Mr.  Gwin  the  minister  about  1640  could  no 
hinder    y'^  performing  of  this  ancient  custome.      I  believe  this 

custom  was  heretofore  used  over  all  Wales. 

***** 
In  North-Wales  the  Sinne-eaters  are  frequently  made  use  of; 

but   there,    insted  of  a  Bowie  of  Beere,  they  have  a  bowle  of 

Milke. 


The  Sin- Eater.  147 

Methinkes,  Doles  to  Poore  people  with  money  at  Funeralls  have 
some  resemblance  to  that  of  y"  Sinne-eater.  Doles  at  Funeralls 
were  continued  at  Gentlemens  funeralls  in  the  West  of  England 
till  the  Civil-warre.  And  so  in  Germany  at  rich  mens  funerals 
Doles  are  in  use,  and  to  every  one  a  Quart  of  strong  and  good 
Beer. — Cramer.^ 

Ellis,  who  quotes  Aubrey  from  the  MS.,  also  reprints 
from  Iceland's  Collectanea  a  letter  from  a  Mr,  Bagford 
giving  a  slightly  varied  account,  also  professedly  derived 
from  Aubrey.  The  letter  is  dated  ist  Feb.  17 14-5,  and 
runs  thus : 

"Within  the  memory  of  our  Fathers,  in  Shropshire,  in  those 
villages  adjoyning  to  Wales,  when  a  person  dyed,  there  was 
notice  given  to  an  old  Sire,  (for  so  they  called  him,)  who  pre- 
sently repaired  to  the  place  where  the  deceased  lay,  and  stood 
before  the  door  of  the  house,  when  some  of  the  Family  came  out 
and  furnished  him  with  a  Cricket,  on  which  he  sat  down  facing 
the  door.  Then  they  gave  him  a  Groat,  which  he  put  in  his 
pocket ;  a  Crust  of  Bread,  which  he  eat ;  and  a  full  bowle  of  Ale, 
which  he  drank  off  at  a  draught.  After  this,  he  got  up  from  the 
Cricket  and  pronounced,  wdth  a  composed  gesture,  the  ease  and 
rest  of  the  Soul  departed,  for  which  he  would  pawn  his  oivn  Soul."'^ 

The  only  other  mention  of  this  custom  of  any  import- 
ance is  by  the  late  Mr.  Matthew  Moggridge  of  Swansea, 
at  a  meeting  of  the  Cambrian  Archaeological  Association 
held  at  Ludlow  in  1852.  His  account  was  that  "when  a 
person  died,  the  friends  sent  for  the  Sin-eater  of  the 
district,  who  on  his  arrival  placed  a  plate  of  salt  on  the 
breast  of  the  defunct,  and  upon  the  salt  a  piece  of  bread. 
He  then  muttered  an  incantation  over  the  bread,  which  he 
finally  ate,  thereby  eating  up  all  the  sins  of  the  deceased. 
This  done,  he  received  his  fee  of  2s.  6d.,  and  vanished  as 
quickly  as  possible  from  the  general  gaze  ;  for,  as  it  was 
believed  that  he  really  appropriated  to  his  own  use  and 
behoof  the  sins  of  all  those  over  whom  he  performed  the

above  ceremony,  he  was  utterly  detested  in  the  neighbour- 
hood— regarded  as  a  mere  Pariah — as  one  irredeemably 
lost."  Mr.  Moggridge  specified  the  neighbourhood  of  Llan- 
debie,  about  twelve  or  thirteen  miles  from  Swansea,  as  a 
place  where  the  custom  had  survived  to  within  a  recent 
period.^ 

No  explanation  of  this  strange  custom  has,  so  far  as  I 
know,  been  hitherto  offered,  beyond  Aubrey's  conjecture 
that  it  has  some  reference  to  the  Hebrew  Scape-goat.  I 
propose  briefly  to  compare  it  with  one  or  two  other  cus- 
toms in  this  country  and  abroad,  for  the  purpose  if  possible 
of  tracing  its  origin.  In  doing  so  I  will  ask  you  to  assume 
that,  as  is  usual  in  traditional  rites  which  have  continued 
to  modern  times,  we  have  in  the  custom  described  only  a 
mutilated  form  of  the  original  ceremony.  If  that  ceremony 
was  in  ancient  times  at  all  widely  distributed  we  shall 
probably  find  its  remains  in  places  far  apart  ;  but  we  must 
not  expect  to  find  them  all  exactly  alike.  The  portion  of 
the  ceremony,  or  the  interpretation  of  it,  which  most 
forcibly  strikes  the  popular  imagination,  and  is  conse- 
quently held  most  tenaciously  in  the  popular  memory,  in 
one  place  is  not  always  precisely  that  which  is  to  be  re- 
cognized at  first  sight  elsewhere.  We  shall  have  to  piece 
together  the  relics  we  find,  first  in  order  to  show  that  they 
relate  to  the  same  rite,  that  they  are  in  fact  portions  of  the 
same  pattern,  though  perhaps  distorted  or  half  obliterated, 
and  secondly  to  discover  what  the  original  pattern  was. 
Fortunately  in  the  present  case  the  pattern  is  simple,  and 
the  fragments,  though  few,  are  unmistakable  in  their 
characteristics. 

At  present  we  will  note  that  the  rite  has  to  do  with  the 
disposal  of  the  dead,  that  the  eating  of  food  placed  upon 
the  cofiin,  or  rather  upon  the  body  itself,  is  the  substance 
of  the  rite,  and  that  the  belief  connected  with  it  is  that  by 
the  act  of  eating  some  properties  of  the  dead  are  taken 
over  by  the  eater.  With  this  general  idea  in  our  minds  we 
may  look  for  analogues.

The  Sin-Eater.  149 

In  the  Highlands  of  Bavaria  we  are  told  that  when  the 
corpse  is  placed  upon  the  bier  the  room  is  carefully  washed 
out  and  cleaned.  It  was  formerly  the  custom  for  the 
housewife  then  to  prepare  the  LeicJien-nudeln,  which  I  may 
perhaps  freely  translate  as  Corpse-cakes.  Having  kneaded 
the  dough,  she  placed  it  to  rise  on  the  dead  body,  which  lay 
there  enswathed  in  a  linen  shroud.  When  the  dough  had 
risen  the  cakes  were  baked  for  the  expected  guests.  To 
the  cakes  so  prepared  the  belief  attached  that  they  con- 
tained the  virtues  and  advantages  ( Vortheile)  of  the  de- 
parted, and  that  thus  the  living  strength  of  the  deceased 
passed  over  by  means  of  the  corpse-cakes  into  the  kinsmen 
who  consumed  them,  and  so  was  retained  within  the 
kindred.^ 

Here  we  find  ourselves  at  an  earlier  stage  in  the  disin- 
tegration of  tradition  than  in  the  Welsh  custom.  The 
eating  is  not  merely  that  of  food  placed  upon  the  breast  of 
the  dead  man,  and  so  in  some  way  symbolically  identified 
with  him.  The  dough  in  rising  is  believed  actually  to 
absorb  his  qualities,  which  are  transmitted  to  those  of  his 
kin  who  partake  of  the  cakes,  and,  consistently  with  the 
custom  requiring  the  relatives  to  eat  these  cakes,  that  the 
qualities  transferred  are  not  evil  but  good  ones  :  the  living 
strength,  the  virtues  and  so  on  of  the  dead  are  retained 
within  the  kin. 

Something  like  this  may  have  been  the  meaning  of  the 
Dyak  funeral  rite  in  which  food  is  set  before  the  dead  ere 
the  coffin  is  closed.  It  is  allowed  to  stand  for  about  an 
hour  by  the  corpse  and  is  then  devoured  by  the  nearest 
relations  of  the  departed.^  So  also  when  a  Hungarian 
Gipsy  dies  he  is  carried  out  of  the  tent  or  hut.  It  is  then 
the  duty  of  the  members  of  his  family  {Stammgenossen)  to 
offer  to  the  deceased  gifts,  especially   food  and  drink   of

various  kinds  which  they  lay  beside  the  body,  and  after- 
wards themselves  consume.^ 

In  the  Scottish  Lowlands  a  curious,  and  apparently 
meaningless,  ceremony  used  to  take  place  about  a 
hundred  years  ago  on  the  occasion  of  a  death.  It  is 
thus  described  : 

"  When  a  body  has  been  washed  and  laid  out,  one  of  the 
oldest  women  present  must  light  a  candle,  and  wave  it  three 
times  around  the  corpse.  Then  she  must  measure  three  handfuls 
of  common  salt  into  an  earthenware  plate,  and  lay  it  on  the 
breast.  Lastly,  she  arranges  three  '  toom'  or  empty  dishes  on  the 
hearth,  as  near  as  possible  to  the  fire  ;  and  all  the  attendants 
going  out  of  the  room  return  into  it  backwards,  repeating  this 
'  rhyme  of  saining' : 

'  Thrice  the  torchie,  thrice  the  saltie. 
Thrice  the  dishies  toom  for  "  loffie"  [/>.,  praise], 
These  three  times  three  ye  must  wave  round 
The  corpse  until  it  sleep  sound. 
Sleep  sound  and  wake  nane. 
Till  to  heaven  the  soul's  gane. 
If  ye  want  that  soul  to  dee 

Fetch  the  torch  frae  th'  Elleree  [seer,  or  wizard] ; 
Gin  ye  want  that  soul  to  live, 
Between  the  dishes  place  a  sieve. 
An'  it  sail  have  a  fair,  fair  shrive.' 

This  rite  is  called  Dishaloof  Sometimes,  as  is  named  in  the 
verses,  a  sieve  is  placed  between  the  dishes,  and  she  who  is  so 
fortunate  as  to  place  her  hand  in  it  is  held  to  do  most  for  the 
soul.  If  all  miss  the  sieve,  it  augurs  ill  for  the  departed.  Mean- 
while all  the  windows  in  the  house  are  opened,  in  order  to  give 
the  soul  free  egress.  .  .  In  some  of  the  western  counties,  however, 
the  dishes  are  set  upon  a  table  or  '  bunker'  (as  they  call  a  long 
chest)  close  to  the  death-bed ;  and  it  is  actually  said  that  while 
the  attendants  sit  with  their  hands  in  the  dishes  they  'spae'  or 
tell  fortunes,  sing  songs  or  repeat  rhymes,  in  the  middle  of  which 

1  Von  Wlislocki,  Volksglaube  und  religioser  Branch  der  Zigeu?ier.,

The  Sin-Eater.  1 5 1 

the  corpse,  it  is  averred,  has  been  known  to  rise  frowning,  and 
place  its  cold  hand  in  one  of  the  dishes,  thus  presaging  death  to 
her  whose  hand  was  in  that  dish  already.  The  Dishaloof  so  far 
over,  the  company  join  hands  and  dance  round  the  dishes,  singing 
this  burden  :  '  A  dis,  a  dis,  a  dis,  a  green  gris,  a  dis,  a  dis,  a  dis.' 
Bread,  cheese,  and  spirits  are  then  placed  on  the  table,  and,  when 
the  company  have  partaken  of  them,  they  are  at  liberty  to  go 
home."^ 

The  explanation  of  this  Scottish  rite  is  not  quite  so  easy 
as  that  of  some  others.  But  I  think  it  will  be  agreed  that 
it  is  hardly  possible  to  assign  an  intelligible  meaning  to  it 
if  it  be  not  of  the  same  order  of  thought  as  that  expressed 
in  the  Bavarian,  and  perhaps  also  in  the  Dyak,  and  Gipsy 
rites.  The  empty  dishes  placed  on  the  hearth,  or  on  a 
table  close  beside  the  corpse,  the  attendants  sitting  with 
their  hands  in  them,  the  completion  of  the  performance 
by  eating  and  drinking  of  food  set  on  the  table  in  the  very 
place  where  the  dishes  have  been,  all  point  to  a  ceremonial 
banquet  in  which  the  food  has  a  mysterious  connection 
with  the  dead.  There  is  no  doubt  something  which  this 
supposition  does  not  fully  explain — the  sieve,  for  example, 
and  the  words  of  the  songs  ;  but  we  must  remember  that 
the  dishes  give  their  name  to  the  rite,  and  are  bound  up 
with  its  essential  elements,  while  there  can  be  no  doubt 
that  it  is  in  a  state  of  decadence.  Now  when  a  ceremonial 
is  decaying  and  passing  gradually  out  of  use,  the  non- 
essential portions  first  drop  out  and  are  replaced  by  others, 
or  altogether  omitted.  This,  therefore,  is  what  we  should 
have  expected  to  occur  to  this  Lowland  rite. 

The  Lowland,  the  Dyak,  and  the  Gipsy  rites,  however, 
are  all  more  archaic,  and  therefore  more  significant  in  form 
than  the  custom  of  doles  of  money  and  food  at  funerals, 
which  was  identified  by  Aubrey  in  the  passages  I  have 
quoted,  as  well  as  by  more  recent  writers,  as  a  survival  of 

"■  Henderson,  Folk-lore  of  the  Northern  Counties,  53,  quoting  the 
Wilkie  MSS. 


152  The  Sin-Eater. 

the  Sin-eater.  That  this  identification  is  substantially 
correct  will  be  seen,  not  only  from  the  instances  already 
given,  but  also  from  Pennant's  statement  that  in  Wales, 
"  previous  to  a  funeral,  it  was  customary,  when  the  corpse 
was  brought  out  of  the  house  and  laid  upon  the  bier,  for 
the  next  of  kin,  be  it  widow,  mother,  sister,  or  daughter 
(for  it  must  be  a  female),  to  give,  over  the  coffin,  a  quantity 
of  white  loaves,  in  a  great  dish,  and  sometimes  a  cheese, 
with  a  piece  of  money  stuck  in  it,  to  certain  poor  persons. 
After  that,  they  present,  in  the  same  manner,  a  cup  of 
drink,  and  require  the  person  to  drink  a  little  of  it  im- 
mediately. When  that  is  done,  all  present  kneel  down, 
and  the  minister,  if  present,  says  the  Lord's  Prayer  ;  after 
which  they  proceed  with  the  corpse.  .  .  To  this  hour  the 
bier  is  carried  by  the  next  of  kin  ;  a  custom  considered  as 
the  highest  respect  that  filial  piety  can  pay  to  the  de- 
ceased."^ 

It  is  not  at  all  uncommon,  as  folk-lore  students  are 
aware,  that  tribal,  communal,  and  other  feasts  in  the  last 
stage  of  their  decadence  come  to  be  represented  by  gifts  of 
food  to  the  poor.  The  significance  of  the  custom  as  re- 
lated by  Pennant  is  that  the  food  and  drink  are  given  across 
the  coffin,  by  the  next  of  kin,  and  that  if  the  recipients  are 
not  required  to  eat  the  bread  on  the  spot,  they  have  at  least 
to  drink  of  the  liquor  offered  them.  At  funerals  in  Ireland 
a  plate  of  snuff  is  placed  upon  the  breast  of  the  dead,  or  npon 
the  coffin,  and  everyone  who  attends  the  funeral  is  ex- 
pected to  take  a  pinch.  This  custom  seems  to  be  hardly 
yet  extinct,  as  I  have  lately  spoken  to  eye-witnesses  of  it 
during  quite  recent  years.  In  South  Wales  a  plate  of  salt 
is  still  often  laid  on  the  breast  of  the  corpse  (a  custom  once 
common  in  a  much  wider  area)  ;  and  "in  a  parish  near 
Chepstow  it  was  usual  to  make  the  figure  of  a  cross  on  the 
salt,  and  cutting  an  apple  or  an  orange  into  quarters, 
to  put  one  piece  at  each  termination  of  the  lines"  ;  while 
in    Pembrokeshire   a   lighted    candle    was    stuck    in    the 

1  Pennant,  Tour  in  Wales  (London,  1784),  ii,  338. 


The  Sin- Eater.  153 

salt.^  At  the  opening  of  a  coffin  in  St.  Mary's  Church, 
Leicester,  not  long  ago  there  was  found  on  the  breast  of  the 
dead  a  plate  made  of  tin  which  it  was  conjectured  had  con- 
tained salt.-  In  the  neighbourhood  of  Salzwedel,  in  Altmark, 
a  spoon  and  dish  were,  among  other  things,  form.erly  put 
into  the  coffin.^  It  is  impossible,  however,  to  lay  any  stress 
on  the  last-mentioned  custom,  since  salt  is  of  frequent  use 
against  spirits  and  witches,  and  the  articles  buried  with  the 
dead  may  rather  have  been  intended  for  use  in  the  spirit- 
world  than  the  relics  of  a  funeral  observance  in  the  nature 
of  a  feast  by  the  survivors.  The  occupant  of  the  coffin  at 
Leicester  may  have  been  a  priest,  for  a  paten  of  some 
inferior  metal  was  commonly  buried  with  a  priest. 

But  I  ought  not  to  leave  quite  unmentioned  as 
vestiges  of  a  feast  the  custom  which  obtained  in  Wales 
as  well  as  in  England  of  giving  small  sponge-cakes  to  the 
funeral  guests.  In  Yorkshire  and  elsewhere  the  last  part 
of  the  funeral  entertainment  before  the  procession  started 
for  the  churchyard  was  to  hand  round  "  glasses  of  wine  and 
small  round  cakes  of  the  crisp  sponge  description,  of  which 
most  of  the  guests  partook."  These  cakes  were  called 
"  Avril  bread".  The  word  avril  is  said  to  be  derived  from 
arval,  succession-ale,  heir-ale,  the  name  of  the  feasts  held 
by  Icelandic  heirs  on  succeeding  to  property.^  Many  other 
survivals  of  funeral  feasts  might  be  cited  ;  but  they  would 
be  irrelevant  to  my  present  purpose.  I  will  only  add  that 
a  foreigner,  describing  a  nobleman's  obsequies  which  he 
witnessed  at  Shrewsbury  in  the  early  years  of  King  Charles 
II,  states  that  the  minister  made  a  funeral  oration  in  the 
chamber  where  the  body  lay,  and  "  during  the  oration  there 
stood  upoji  the  coffiji  a  large  pot  of  wine,  out  of  which  every

one  drank  to  the  health  of  the  deceased.  This  benig 
finished  six  men  took  up  the  Corps,  and  carried  it  on  their 
shoulders  to  the  church."^ 

The  exhibition  of  cakes  at  the  recent  Folk-lore  Con- 
gress included  a  Kolyva  cake  as  made  and  used  among 
the  Greeks  of  Turkey.  On  the  fortieth  day  after  death  a 
loaf  is  sent  to  each  family  of  the  friends  of  the  deceased  as 
a  token  of  invitation  to  the  commemorative  service.  The 
kolyva,  a  mixture  of  which  the  basis  is  boiled  wheat,  is 
blessed  by  the  priests,  and  each  person  present  takes  a 
handful,  saying,  as  he  does  so,  "God  rest  him!"  The 
ceremony  is  repeated  the  next  day.  The  mourners  then 
eat  a  meal  together  before  proceeding  to  the  cemetery 
with  the  priest  to  erect  a  tombstone  over  the  grave.  The 
poor  of  the  neighbourhood,  we  are  told,  are  in  the  evening 
regaled  with  a  supper,  during  which  their  wishes  for  the 
soul  of  the  departed  are  repeatedly  expressed."  This 
custom  is  recorded  in  Miss  Garnett's  book  on  the  women 
of  Turkey.  More  remarkable  still  is  another  custom  which 
I  do  not  find  mentioned  there,  but  of  which  she  herself  in- 
formed me.  Cakes  made  of  boiled  wheat  similar  to  the 
kolyva  cakes,  but  without  the  elaborate  ornamentation 
which  covers  them,  are  carried  in  the  funeral  procession — 
whether  or  not  immediately  behind  the  corpse  Miss  Gar- 
nett  was  not  quite  certain,  though  that  is  not,  perhaps,  very 
material.  After  the  coffin  has  been  put  into  the  grave  the 
cake  is  broken  up  and  eaten  by  the  mourners  then  and 
there  above  the  tomb,  each  one  of  them  pronouncing  the 
words  :  "  God  rest  him  !  "  just  as  the  Sin-eater  pronounced 
the  ease  and  rest  of  the  soul  departed,  and  just  as  at  the 
nobleman's  funeral  at  Shrewsbury  the  guests  drank  to  the 
health  of  the  deceased."     The  eating  of  the  kolyva  on  the

The  Sin- Eater.  155 

fortieth  day  seems  to  be  a  commemorative  repetition  of 
this  ceremony. 

When  we  set  these  traditional  observances  side  by  side 
their  meaning  is  transparent.  The  partaking  of  food  and 
drink  which  have  been  placed  upon,  or  near,  the  body,  or 
the  coffin  of  the  deceased,  or  are  delivered  over  the  coffin 
to  be  consumed — an  act,  in  the  most  elaborate  of  these 
rites,  distinctly  believed  to  convey  to  the  persons  who 
partake  some  at  all  events  of  the  properties  of  the  dead — 
can  only  be  a  relic  of  a  savage  feast  where  the  meat  con- 
sumed was  the  very  body  of  the  deceased  kinsman.  The 
solemn  eating  at  the  grave  of  a  cake  carried  in  the  funeral 
procession  is  an  analogous  rite  and  points  to  an  identical 
origin.  The  eating  of  the  dead,  however  repulsive  to  us,  is 
known  by  the  testimony  of  ancient  writers  to  have  been 
the  practice  of  many  barbarous  tribes  ;  and  travellers  have 
likewise  found  it  among  modern  savages.^  In  particular, 
Strabo  records  it  of  the  ancient  Irish,  telling  us  that  they 
considered  it  praiseworthy  to  devour  their  dead  fathers.^ 
The  inhabitants  of  Britain  were  at  that  time,  as  he  ex- 
pressly says,  more  civilized  than  the  Irish.  They  had 
perhaps  already  passed  beyond  the  stage  at  which  this  rite, 
in  its  horrible  literalness,  was  possible.  But  they  came  of 
the  same  stock  as  the  Irish,  in  so  far  at  least  as  they  both 
were  of  Celtic  blood  ;  and  it  is  apposite  to  my  argument  to 
remind  you  that  the  latest  anthropological  investigations 
seem  to  point  to  a  large  proportion  of  Celtic  blood  also 
in  the  people  of  Upper  Bavaria.  The  inference  that  the 
ancient  cannibalism   related    only  of  the   Irish  was  once 

that  images  of  the  dead  were  made  upon  the  cakes.  This  detail,  I 
venture  to  think,  strengthens  my  argument,  though  it  is  fair  to  say 
that  Dr.  Gaster  did  not  accept  this  view  nor  my  conclusion. 

Mt  is  hardly  necessary  to  refer  to  the  very  numerous  cases  re- 
corded by  modern  travellers.  The  latest  I  have  met  with  is  a  dis- 
gusting custom  among  the  Bangala,  referred  to  by  Dr.  Schneider,  Die 
Religion  der  afrika7iischert  Natiirv'6lkei\  135.

common  to  all  these  three  peoples,  among  whom  similar 
modern  practices  like  thoseof  the  Sin-eater,  the  snuff-taking, 
and  the  corpse-cakes  have  been  found,  is  well  within  the 
limits  of  induction.  And  it  is  confirmed  by  the  customs, 
either  still  existent  or  quite  recent,  of  the  Greeks,  the 
Scotch,  and  (though  more  doubtfully)  of  the  Dyaks  and 
the  Gipsies,  which  appear  to  indicate  the  like  practice 
among  their  respective  ancestors. 

But  the  strongest  corroboration  of  the  correctness  of 
my  conclusion  is  found  in  a  repulsive  custom,  to  which  my 
attention  has  been  called  by  a  friend  since  this  paper  was 
read  to  the  Society.  This  custom  is  practised  by  a 
number  of  tribes  inhabiting  the  valley  of  the  Uaupes, 
a  tributary  of  the  Amazons.  Their  houses  are  generally 
built  to  accommodate  the  whole  community ;  and  the 
dead  are  buried  beneath  the  floor.  About  a  month  after 
the  funeral,  Dr.  Wallace  tells  us,  the  survivors  "  disinter  the 
corpse,  which  is  then  much  decomposed,  and  put  it  in  a 
great  pan,  or  oven,  over  the  fire,  till  all  the  volatile  parts 
are  driven  off  with  a  most  horrible  odour,  leaving  only 
a  black  carbonaceous  mass,  which  is  pounded  into  a  fine 
powder,  and  mixed  in  several  large  couches  (vats  made  of 
hollowed  trees)  of  a  fermented  drink  called  caxiri :  this  is 
drunk  by  the  assembled  company  till  all  is  finished  ;  they 
believe  that  thus  the  virtues  of  the  deceased  will  be  trans- 
mitted to  the  drinkers."^ 

The  reason  here  expressly  assigned  for  the  custon]  is 
neither  more  nor  less  than  that  given  by  the  Highlanders 
of  Bavaria  for  making  and  eating  the  corpse-cakes.  It  is 
a  general  belief  in  the  lower  culture  that  food  communi- 
cated its  qualities  to  the  eater.  From  the  flesh  of  tigers 
courage  and  strength,  speed  from  that  of  stags,  timidity 
from  that  of  hares,  pass  into  those  who  eat  them.  The 
same  order  of  thought  leads  the  Taridnas  and  other  tribes 
of    the    Uaupes  to  try  to  retain  within  the  kindred  the

Rio  Negro^  3rd  ed.  (1890),  346. 


The  Sin-Eate7\  157 

good  qualities  of  a  departed  member  by  consuming  his 
body  powdered  in  drink.  The  Bavarian  peasant  has  passed 
the  stage  whereat  the  coarse  directness  of  this  expedient 
can  be  tolerated.  He  tries  to  achieve  the  same  result  by 
the  symbolical  act  of  eating  cakes  baked  of  dough  which 
has  been  put  upon  the  breast  of  the  dead  man  to  rise,  and 
has  in  rising  absorbed  his  virtues.  In  the  Sin-eater  the 
same  act  is  put  to  another,  but  strictly  analogous,  use  in  the 
absorption  of  the  sins  of  the  dead.  Why  it  was  supposed 
that  in  the  one  case  good,  and  in  the  other  evil,  properties 
were  communicated  we  do  not  know.  Some  variation  in 
the  view  taken  of  the  matter  by  the  clergy  may  have  led 
to  the  rite  being  considered  disgraceful  in  Wales,  and  so 
may  have  rendered  those  who  persisted  in  it  the  objects  of 
persecution.  Payment  to  undertake  the  odium,  the  con- 
sequent degradation  as  well  of  the  rite  as  of  the  person 
who  performed  it,  and  the  influence  of  the  Biblical  account 
of  the  Hebrew  Scape-goat  may  have  done  the  rest.  The 
gifts  of  food  to  the  poor,  both  in  their  intermediate  form 
described  by  Pennant,  and  in  their  final  form  as  mere 
doles,  however,  point  to  a  different  interpretation  of  the 
same  original  observance.  They  can  hardly  be  derived 
from  the  Sin-eater  ;  their  relation  to  it  is  not  lineal  but 
collateral.  They  are  variants  of  the  ceremony,  and 
variants  bearing  the  strongest  testimony  to  the  form  and 
meaning  of  the  parent  type.

MR.    HARTLAND'S   "SIN-EATER",   AND    PRIMI-TIVE  SACRAMENTS.

To    the   Editor   of  FOLK-LORE. 

Sir, — Will  you  allow  me  to  ask  Mr.  Hartland  how  the 
very  interesting  funeral  rites  which  we  owe  to  his  paper  on 


Co7n'espondeiice.  547 

the  "  Sin-Eater",  in  the  current  journal,  can  be  considered 
as  the  outcome  of  one  belief,  in  various  stages  ? 

I  gather  that  he  would  treat  as  acts  expressing  a  common 
idea  the  "sin-eating"  of  old  English  custom,  where  the 
whole  gist  of  the  usage,  as  celebrated  by  the  "  folk",  lies  in 
the  cathartic  significance,  and  where  the  celebrant  has  no 
kinship  with  the  deceased  ;  the  Bavarian  usage,  where  the 
ritual  cake  is  eaten  by  the  kindred,  that  they  may  there- 
with receive  the  "  virtues  and  advantages"  of  the  dead 
kinsman,  on  or  beside  whose  body  the  cake  has  lain  ;  the 
Scotch  watchers'  rite  of  placing  their  hands  in  the  empty 
dishes  and  afterzvaj-ds  eating ;  and  the  breaking  and  eat- 
ing over  the  grave  of  the  Turkish  cakes. 

The  customs  of  which  these  seem  to  be  typical  examples 
are  classed  together  as  expressions  of  one  belief;  and  this 
belief  is  explained  as  the  survival  of  a  primitive  cannibal- 
ism induced  by  the  widely-spread  primitive  idea  that,  by 
eating  the  flesh,  the  qualities  of  the  man  or  creature  may 
be  received.  How  does  Mr.  Hartland  prove  that  all  the 
instances  he  gives,  where  the  reception  of  the  qualities  of 
the  dead  is  in  no  way  mentioned,  can  be  treated  as  resting 
on  this  special  cause  ;  and  not  on  that  universal  article  of 
primitive  creeds — perhaps  one  of  the  most  necessary  and 
sacred  of  all  faiths  to  the  savage  mind — the  renewal  of  the 
tribal  kinship  by  the  tribal  sacrament  of  commensal  eat- 
ing? Most  of  Mr.  Hartland's  instances  seem  to  point  to 
this  as  their  cause,  and  to  be  examples  of  the  universal 
custom  of  offering  food  to  the  disembodied  tribesman,  and 
of  preserving  the  tie  between  the  dead  and  living  by 
eating  together  in  the  sacrament  of  the  common  meal. 

I  do  not  like  to  trespass  on  your  space  by  giving  the 
full  evidence  which  would,  I  think,  justify  me  in  venturing 
to  differ  from  Mr.  Hartland.  But  the  importance  of  any 
point  touching  on  primitive  sacraments,  and  of  the  kind  of 
intercourse  which  the  undeveloped  reason  conceives  to  be 
possible  between  tribal  spirits  ("  ghosts  of  worship"  often) 
and  tribesmen  still  in  the  flesh,  will,  I  think,  excuse  my 


54^  Correspondence. 

troubling  you  with  these  brief  references,  not  as  accumula- 
tive evidence,  but  as  examples. 

Bishop  Callaway  (pp.  141-44)  gives  ample  evidence,  from 
direct  native  sources,  of  the  desire  of  tribesmen  to  "  recall" 
— renew  the  bond  of  intercourse  with — the  soul  of  the  dead 
tribesman.^  Dr.  Tylor,  Primitive  Culture,  ii,  p.  16,  refers  to 
a  commensal  meal  between  the  spirits  and  the  tribe  in 
yearly  ritual  ;  and  on  p.  40  seq.  he  gives  Mexican,  Hindoo, 
Chinese,  and  Slavonic  examples.^  Dr.  Codrington  deals 
with  the  question  of  the  "  common  participation"  in  the 
death-meal  (p.  272)  ;  the  eating  of  the  meal  by  the  grave 
{ibid.)  ;  and  he  quotes  one  case  (p.  281)  where  the  rite  of 
placing  the  common  food  upon  the  body  is  transferred  to 
that  of  placing  the  kinsman  himself  thereon.  Could  the 
kin-bond  be  expressed  with  more  physical  and  primitive 
directness  ?^ 

I  think  it  is  worth  noting  that  in  Dr.  Codrington's 
account  of  the  details  of  Melanesian  beliefs  and  practices 
concerning  the  body  and  soul  after  death,  there  is  only 
one  mention  of  the  cannibalistic  usages  Mr.  Hartland 
quotes  (except  an  incidental  reference  on  p.  28.4) ;  and 
that  in  this  one  case  the  rite  is  performed  by  women,  who 
would  scarcely  be  selected  (unless  with  a  view  to  their  de- 
scendants) as  recipients  by  this  means  of  the  dead  tribes- 
man's good  qualities.  No  mention  of  such  design  is  here 
made,  and  the  act  in  this  case  looks  like  a  form  of  the  primi- 
tive taboo,  which  forbids  any  holy  thing  (such,  e.g.,  as  the 
tribesman's  blood)  to  fall  to  the  ground. 

The  commensal  meal,  shared  between  the  spirit  of  the 
dead  kinsman  and  the  survivors,  seems  clearly  betrayed  in 
the  elapse  of  an  hour  in  the  Dyak  rite  quoted  by  Mr. 
Hartland.  The  Amazulu  may  again  serve  as  an  example 
of  the  primitive  form  of  sacrifice,  which,  according  to  ex- 
press native  statement,  consists  in  leaving  the  offering  for

an  interval,  during  wJdcJi  the  deity  receives  the  invisible, 
and  after  whicJi  the  worshippers  eat  the  visible,  portion.^ 
(Cf.  the  ghostly  meal,  "tamani",  leaving  the  visible  food 
intact  upon  the  grave,  in  Melanesia,  Dr.  Codrington,  op.  cit., 
p.  283.) 

Whether  the  cathartic  rite  of  "  Sin  Eating"  has  any  es- 
sential connection  with  this  tribal  sacrament  would  seem  to 
be  a  most  interesting  point,  and  would  perhaps  touch  the 
question  of  the  ethical  element  in  savage  religion  ;  but  all 
that  I  would  ask  here  is  whether  Mr.  Hartland  is  justified 
in  treating  all  the  customs  and  rites  he  collects,  as  es- 
sentially related,  and  therefore  as  evidence  for  a  common 
cause  ;  and  whether  the  cause  of  some  of  these  rites  is  not 
a  far  deeper  and  more  significant  one,  than  the  idea  which 
he  suggests  ? 

Ritual  celebrated  among  many  peoples,  by  the  kinsmen, 
at  the  death  of  a  member  of  the  kin,  in  survival  or  in  situ, 
such  as  Mr.  Hartland  quotes,  seems  to  me  to  demand  a 
cause  lying  nearer  to  the  principles  of  primitive  tribal  life, 
and  to  the  primitive  religious  need  of  the  individual  tribes- 
man, than  a  device  occasionally  resorted  to  for  increasing 
physical  or  mental  acquirements.  Moreover,  is  the  usage 
restricted  to  the  cases  of  powerful  or  respected  members  of 
the  kindred?  Since  Mr.  Hartland  finds  in  this  usage  the 
origin  of  practices  which  are  identical  in  every  detail  with 
the  sacramental  meals  participated  in  by  the  spirits  of 
dead  kinsmen  and  their  surviving  kindred,  these  his 
argument  must  also  claim  to  have  explained.  What 
would  Professor  Robertson  Smith  say  to  this  theory  of  the 
origin  of  the  primitive  sacramental  meal? 

If  the  cases  quoted  by  Mr.  Hartland  of  the  consumption 

of  the  body  of  the  kinsman  are  essentially  related  to  the 

rites  he  seeks  to  explain,  is  it  not  only  as  the  accidental 

condition  which  the  universal  ritual  of  the  primitive  tribal 

sacrament  sometimes  assumes?

MR.    HARTLAND'S    "SIN-EATER",    AND 
PRIMITIVE    SACRAMENTS. 

To  the  Editor  of  Folk- LORE. 

Sir, — Miss  Godden's  wide  reading  and  rapid  induction 
have  anticipated  a  conclusion  which,  when  I  wrote  the 
paper  on  "  The  Sin-Eater",  had  definitely  formed  itself  in 
my  mind,  but  which  I  did  not  feel  justified  in  enunciating 
for  want  of  evidence.  The  evidence,  however,  is  accumu- 
lating, and  I  hope  to  deal  with  it  ere  long.  Meantime,  it 
Miss  Godden  would  be  good  enough  to  direct  my  attention 
to  any  facts  of  special  interest  in  this  connection  she  would 
be  conferring  a  favour  upon  me.

"THE    SIN-EATER." 

To  the  Editor  of  FoLK-LoRE. 

Sir, — In  connection  with  Mr.  Hartland's  article  on  "The 
Sin-Eater"  in  Folk- Lore  for  June  1892,  the  following 
occurrence  at  a  funeral  near  Market  Drayton  in  Shrop- 
shire may  interest  you. 

The  funeral  took  place  on  the  first  of  this  present  month. 

The  minister  of  the  chapel  where  the  deceased  woman 
had  been  a  regular  attendant  held  a  short  service  in  the 
cottage  before  the  coffin  was  removed. 

The  lady,  who  gave  ms  the  particulars,  arrived  rather 
early,  and  found  the  bearers  enjoying  a  good  lunch  in  the 
only  downstairs  room.  Shortly  afterwards  the  coffin  was 
brought  down  and  placed  on  two  chairs  in  the  centre  of 
the  room,  and  the  mourners  having  gathered  round  it  the 
service  proceeded.  Directly  the  minister  ended,  the  woman 
in  charge  of  the  arrangements  poured  out  four  glasses  of 
wine  and  handed  one  to  each  bearer  present  across  the 
coffin,  with  a  biscuit  called  a  "  funeral  biscuit". 


One  of  the  bearers  being  absent  at  the  moment,  the 
fourth  glass  of  wine  and  biscuit  were  offered  to  the  eldest 
son  of  the  deceased  woman,  who,  however,  refused  to  take 
them,  and  was  not  obliged  to  do  so. 

The  biscuits  were  ordinary  sponge  biscuits,  usually- 
called  "  sponge  fingers"  or  "  lady's  fingers".  They  are, 
however,  also  known  in  the  shops  of  Market  Drayton  as 
"  funeral  biscuits". 

The  minister,  who  had  lately  come  from  Pembrokeshire, 
remarked  to  my  informant  that  he  was  sorry  to  see  that 
pagan  custom  still  observed.  He  had  been  able  to  put  an 
end  to  it  in  the  Pembrokeshire  village  where  he  had 
formerly  been.

The practice of Sin-Eating, was, apparently, common in the Fens until the last decade or two of the last century. An old lady who died in 1906 has recorded how, as a young schoolmistress in Little Ouse, she learned how the sin-eater, who, incidentally, was shunned by all the villagers, qualified for the profession. She took a large dose of poppy tea to render her unconscious. Neighbours sent for the minister who, on seeing her, said it seemed she would not recover. He read the prayers for the dying and gave her absolution. Soon after his departure the woman sat up and gradually recovered. She was then assured by her friends that as she was now free from her own sins by virtue of the absolution, she was now free to take on those of others.

The sin-eater, after eating the half-round of bread and the little pile of salt placed on the shrouds of the dead, would receive as payment thirty pennies, which had been dipped in whitewash to make them resemble silver.
