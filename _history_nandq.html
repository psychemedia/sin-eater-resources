<div><p>Among the many periodicals which issue from the press daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly, there is not one especially intended for Men of Letters. “Literary Journals there are in abundance, many of them of the highest degree of merit, which in their Reviews and Announcements show the current sayings and doings of the literary world. There is not, however, one among them in which the Student may insert his queries in the hope of receiving satisfactory answers, or the Scholar print those minute facts met with in his reading, the value of which he so well knows, for the use of himself and his fellow-labourers in the wide field of letters.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And then a proposed solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTES AND QUERIES, A MEDIUM OF INTER-COMMUNICATION FOR LITERARY MEN, is, as its name implies, intended to supply this deficiency. Those who are pursuing literary inquiries may, through this MEDIUM, ask for information on points which have baffled their own individual researches; while those, again, who meet with facts worthy of preservation, may record them in the same columns How often is even the best-informed writer stopped by an inability to solve some doubt or understand some obscure allusion which suddenly starts up before him! How often does a reading man stumble upon some elucidation of a doubtful phrase, or disputed passage;— some illustration of an obsolete custom hitherto unnoticed;-some biographical anecdote or precise dat ehitherto unrecorded ;-some book, or some edition, hitherto unknown or imperfectly described.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>An invitation to participate then follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This Publication, as everybody’s common place book, will be a depository for those who find such materials, and a resource for those who are in search of them; and if the Editors are enabled by the inter communication of their literary friends to realize their expectations, it will form a most useful supplement to works already in existence,-a treasury for enriching future editions of them, and an important contribution towards a more perfect history than we yet possess of our Language, our Literature, and those to whom we owe them.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The notice closes with practical matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTES AND QUERIES will also be issued in Parts at the end of each Month.</p>
<p>Communications for the Editors may be addressed to the Publisher, Mr. George Bell, No. 186, Fleet-street, by whom also Advertisements will be received.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A second, rather more concise, announcement appeared a week later, October 27th, on <a class="reference external" href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858029267238&amp;amp;view=1up&amp;amp;seq=1087&amp;amp;skin=2021&amp;amp;q1=queries">p1148</a>:</p>

<h2>The Early Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#the-early-issues" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A fortnight on from the original announcement in <em>The Athenaeum</em>, and as advertised, the original edition of <em>Notes and Queries</em>, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/notesqueries01londuoft/page/n9/mode/2up">Vol 1 Iss 1</a>, dated Saturday, November 3rd, 1849, appeared. The opening pages contained an opening address by William Thoms, p1-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTES AND QUERIES.</p>
<p>THE nature and design of the present work have been so fully stated in the Prospectus, and are indeed so far explained by its very Title, that it is unnecessary to occupy any great portion of its first number with details on the subject. We are under no temptation to fill its columns with an account of what we hope future numbers will be. Indeed, we would rather give a specimen than a description ; and only regret that, from the wide range of subjects which it is intended to embrace, and the correspondence and contributions of various kinds which we are led to expect, even this can only be done gradually. A few words of introduction and explanation may, however, be allowed ; and, indeed, ought to be prefixed, that we may be understood, by those readers who have not seen our Prospectus.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Notes and Queries, Prospectus, 1849</p>
<p><em>A copy of the prospectus was reprinted in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-10_1_2/page/30/mode/2up">Vol 1 Iss 2</a> of <em>Notes and Queries</em>, p31, dated November 10th, 1849.</em></p>
<p>NOTES AND QUERIES: a Medium of Inter-communication for Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, ETC.</p>
<p>Among the many periodicals which issue from the press daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly, there is not one especially intended to assist Men of Letters and of research in their pursuits. Literary Journals there are in abundance, many of them of the highest degree of merit, which in their Reviews and Announcements show the current sayings and doings of the literary world. There is not, however, one among them in which the reading man may note, for the use of himself and his fellow-labourers in the wide field of Literature, the minute facts which he meets with from time to time, and the value of which he so well knows, or insert his <em>Queries</em>, in the hope of receiving satifactory answers rom some of his literary brethren.</p>
<p><em>NOTES AND QUERIES: a Medium of Inter-communication for Literary Men</em>, is, as its name implies, intended to supply this deficiency. Those who meet with facts worthy of preservation, may record them in it columns; while those, again, who are pursuing literary inquiries, may, through this medium, ask for information on points which have baffled their own individual researches. How often is even the bxt informed writer stopped by an inability to solve some dount or understand some obscure allusion which suddenly starts up before him! How often does a reading man stumble upon some elucidation of a doubtful phrase, or disputed passage;— some illustration of an obsolete custom hitherto unnoticed;— some biographical anecdote or precise date hitherto unrecorded;— some book, or some edition, hitherto unknown or imperfectly described.</p>
<p>This Publication, as everybody’s common place book, will be a depository for those who find such materials, and a resource for those who are in search of them; and if the Editor is enabled by the intercommunicatio of his literary friends to realise his expectations, it will form a most useful supplement to works already in existence, — a treasury for enriching future editions of them,— and an important contribution towards a more perfect history than we yet possess of our Language, our Literature, nd those to whom we owe them.</p>
<p>Notes and Queries will be published every Saturday, price 3d., or stamped, 4d., and may be had, by order, of all Booksellers and Newsmen, and will also be issued in Parts at the end of each Month.</p>
<p>Communications for the Editor may be addressed to the Publisher, Mr George Bell, No. 186. Fleet Street, by whom also Advertisements will be received.</p>
</div>
<p>What, then, is the guiding principle that motivates this new publication?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“WHEN FOUND, MAKE A NOTE OF,” is a most admirable rule ; and if the excellent Captain had never uttered another word, he might have passed for a profound philosopher. It is a rule which should shine in gilt letters on the gingerbread of youth, and the spectacle-case of age. Every man who reads with any view beyond mere pastime, knows the value of it. Every one, more or less, acts upon it. Every one regrets and suffers who neglects it. There is some trouble in it, to be sure ; but in what good thing is there not ? and what trouble does it save ! Nay, what mischief! Half the lies that are current in the world owe their origin to a misplaced confidence in memory, rather than to intentional falsehood. We have never known more than one man who could deliberately and conscientiously say that his memory had <em>never</em> deceived him ; and he (when he saw that he had excited the surprise of his hearers, especially those who knew how many years he had spent in the management of important commercial affairs) used to add, — because he had never trusted it ; but had uniformly written down what he was anxious to remember.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Personal collections of noteworthy remarks are one thing, but how more valuable might a collective effort be?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that reading and writing men, of moderate industry, who act on this rule for any considerable length of time, will accumulate a good deal of matter in various forms, shapes, and sizes — some more, some less legible and intelligible — some unposted in old pocket books — some on whole or half sheets, or mere scraps of paper, and backs of letters — some, lost sight of and forgotten, stuffing out old portfolios, or getting smoky edges in bundles tied up with faded tape. There are, we are quite sure, countless boxes and drawers, and pigeon-holes of such things, which want looking over, and would well repay the trouble. Nay, we are sure that the proprietors would find themselves much benefited even if we were to do nothing more than to induce them to look over their own collections. How much good might we have done (as well as got, for we do not pretend to speak quite disinterestedly), if we had had the looking over and methodizing of the chaos in which Mr. Oldbuck found himself just at the moment, so agonizing to an author, when he knows that the patience of his victim is oozing away, and fears it will be quite gone before he can lay his hand on the charm which is to fix him a hopeless listener: — “So saying, the Antiquary opened a drawer, and began rummaging among a quantity of miscellaneous papers, ancient and modern. But it was the misfortune of this learned gentleman, as it may be that of many learned and unlearned, that he frequently experienced on such occasions, what Harlequin calls <em>l’embarras des richesses</em> — in other words, the abundance of his collection often prevented him from finding the article he sought for.” We need not add that this unsuccessful search, for Professor MacCribb’s epistle, and the scroll of the Antiquary’s answer, was the unfortunate turning-point on which the very existence of the documents depended, and that from that day to this nobody has seen them, or known where to look for them.</p>
<p>But we hope for more extensive and important benefits, than these from furnishing a medium by which much valuable information may become a sort of common property among those who can appreciate and use it. We do not anticipate any holding back by those whose “ NOTES” are most worth having, or any want of “QUERIES” from those best able to answer them. Whatever may be the case in other things, it is certain that those who are best informed are generally the most ready to communicate knowledge and to confess ignorance, to feel the value of such a work as we are attempting, and to understand that if it is to be well done they must help to do it. Some cheap and frequent means for the interchange of thought is certainly wanted by those who are engaged n literature, art, and science, and we only hope to persuade the best men in all, that we offer them the best medium of communication with each other.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms then make some remarks on the naming of <em>Notes and Queries</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>By this time, we hope, our readers are prepared to admit that our title (always one of the most difficult points of a book to settle), has not been imprudently or unwisely adopted. We wish to bring together the ideas and the wants, not merely of men engaged in the same lines of action or inquiry, but also (and very particularly) of those who are going diferent ways, and only meet at the crossings, where a helping hand is oftenest needed, and they would be happy to give one if they knew it was wanted. In this way we desire that our little book should take “NOTES,” and be a medley of all that men are doing — that the Notes of the writer and the reader, whatever be the subject-matter of his studies, of the antiquary, and the artist, the man of science, the historian, the herald, and the ge- nealogist, in short, Notes relating to all subjects but such as are, in popular discourse, termed either political or polemical, should meet in our columns in such juxta-position, as to give fair play to any natural attraction or repulsion between them, and so that if there are any hooks and eyes among them, they may catch each other.</p>
<p>Now, with all modesty, we submit, that for the title of such a work as we have in view, and have endeavoured to describe, no word could be so proper as “NOTES.” Can any man, in his wildest dream of imagination, conceive of any thing that may not be — nay, that has not been — treated of in a note ? Thousands of things there are, no doubt, which cannot be sublimed into poetry, or elevated into history, or treated of with dignity, in a stilted text of any kind, and which are, as it is, called, “thrown” into notes; but, after all, they are much like children sent out of the stiff drawing-room into the nursery, snubbed to be sure by the act, but joyful in the freedom of banishment. We were going to say (but it might sound vain-glorious), where do things read so well as in notes ? but we will put the question in another form : — Where do you so well test an author’s learning and knowledge of his subject ? — where do you find the pith of his most elaborate researches?— where do his most original suggestions escape ? — where do you meet with the details that fix your attention at the time and cling to your memory for ever? — where do both writer and reader luxuriate so much at their ease, andfeel that they are wisely discursive? But if we pursue this idea, it will be scarcely possible to avoid something which might look like self-praise ; and we content ourselves for the present with expressing our humble conviction that we are doing a service to writers and readers, by calling forth materials which they have themselves thought worth notice, but which, for want of elaboration, and the “little leisure” that has not yet come, are lying, and may lie for ever, unnoticed by others, and presenting them in an unadorned <em>multum-in-parvo</em> form. To our readers therefore who are seeking for Truth, we repeat “When found make a NOTE of;” and we must add, “till then make a QUERY.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the first issue, one of the <em>notices to correspondents</em> explained the initial policies adopted by the Editor in the matter of accepting contributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</p>
<p>The matter is so generally understood with regard to the management of periodical works, that it is hardly necessary for the Editor to say that HE CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO RETURN MANUSCRIPTS ; but on one point he wishes to offer a few words of explanation to his correspondents in general, and particularly to those who do not enable him to communicate with them except in print. They will see, on a very little reflection, that it is plainly his interest to take all he can get, and make the most, and the best, of everything ; and therefore he begs them to take for granted that their communications are received, and ap-preciated, even if the succeeding Number bears no proof of it. He is convinced that the want of specific acknowledgement will only be felt by those who have no idea of the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management of such a work, and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation, when there really is one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay or non-insertion of his communication. Correspondents in such cases have no reason, und if they understood an editor’s position they would feel that they have no right, to consider themselves undervalued; but nothing short of personal experience in editorship would explain to them the perplexities and evil consequences arising from an opposite course.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Several other notices were acknowledged particular contributors:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Aubrey Junior. The coincidence is certainly curious. When the 3rd of November wus fixed for the first appearance of “Notes and Queries,” it was little thought that it was the anniversary of the birth of John Aubrey, the most noted Querist, if not the queerest Noter, of all English antiquaries. His “Mem. to ask Mr. ––” no doubt indirectly suggested our title.</p>
<p>Philobiblion is thanked for his suggestion, that we should “print lists of all the books printed by the Roxburgh, Abbotsford, Camden, Spottiswoode, and other publishing Clubs and Societies.” His suggestion had, howerer, been anticipated : arrangements are making for giving not only the information suggested by Philobiblion, but also particulars of the works issued by the different Continental publishing Societies, such as La Société de L’ Histoire de France, Der Literarische Verein in Stuttgart, and the Svenska Fornskrift-Sällskap of Stockholm, so that the English reader may be put into possession of facts connected with these Societies not to be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Manchester (Box 720.) is thanked for his suggestions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A “book exchange” list was also announced.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Books and Odd Volumes wanted. We believe that this will prove one of the most useful divisions of our weekly Sheet, Gentlemen who may be unable to meet with any book or volume of which they are in want may, upon furnishing name, date, size, &amp;c., have it inserted in this List free of cost. Persons having such volumes to dispose of are requested to send reports of price, &amp;c. to Mr. Bell, our publisher.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the start of the second issue a week later, October 10th, 1849, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-10_1_2/mode/2up">Vol 1 Iss 2</a>, p17-18, Thoms had a little more to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A FEW WORDS TO OUR FRIENDS.</p>
<p>In our opening Address we carefully avoided any thing at all approaching to a boast of what we would, or even what we hoped to perform. We stated that “we would rather give a specimen than a description.” We are now in like manner unwilling to point as exultingly, as we think we might, to the position which we have already taken. But there is a vast difference between vain boasting and the expression of an honest satisfaction; and than an affectation of humility —it would be a mean hypocrisy — if we did not express heartily and unreservedly the gratitude we owe and feel to those who have encouraged us by their friendly advice and able pens. We have opened a Literary Exchange, and we have had the gratification to see that men whose learning and talents the public recognise —leaders in their several branches of inquiry—have at once taken advantage of it. They have proved the necessity for some such medium of communication, as well as their good will to the one now offered to them, by a gathering in its behalf which the public will respect, and of which we may well feel proud.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In creating a <em>medium of exchange</em>, it was perhaps not unsurprising that several correspondents felt it their duty to offer several suggestions to the Editor about how it might be improved, and the Editor in turn assured the readership that concerns would be considered:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Some whose good opinion we most value, and who have spoken most warmly in favour of our plan, have proved the sincerity of their praise by suggestions of improvement in its detail, and hints for its further extension. They may feel assured that such hints and such suggestions shall not be lost sight of.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For example, on the question of accepting corrections:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For instance, one respected correspondent hints that as we have very properly adopted Dr. Maitland’s suggestion with regard to Herbert’s edition of Ames’ <em>Typographical Antiquiries</em>, namely that of “offering a receptacle for illustrations, additions, and corrections,” and invited “our readers to take advantage of our columns to carry out Dr. Maitland’s suggestions,” we should open our columns with equal readiness to the correction and illustration of more modern and more popular works.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, the Editor suggestions that it is the case that not all publications might be worth correcting:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We entirely concur with him ; but in reference to this subject there is a distinction which must be borne in mind. Our own literature, like that of every other country, consists of two classes of books. We have the books of pretenders to knowledge, the hasty, crude, imperfect, but often for the time attractive and popular volumes of the Ned Purdons of the day. These books have a use—such as is is—and thus answer their purpose ; but it would be for the credit of our literature, and save a world of trouble, if they were forgotten as soon as they had done so. To illustrate such books, to add to their information or correct their blunders, would be useless and almost ridiculous. They should be left to die of mere powerlessness and exhaustion, or to wither under the wholesome influence of a just and manly criticism.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, there certainly <em>are</em> books that should be “maintained”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But there are books of another kind — books which our worthy bibliopoles designate as “ standard works.” These are the books of competent workmen—books which are the result of honest labour and research, and which from the moment of their publication assume a permanent station in our national literature. Even in such books there are many things incomplete, many things erroneous. But it is the interest of every man that such books should be rendered as complete as possible; and whatever tends to illustrate or correct works of that class will be sure of insertion in our columns.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Several examples are then given:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We would point to Macaulay’s <em>England</em>, and Hallam’s <em>Introduction to the Literary History of the 15th, 16th, and 17th Centuries</em>, his <em>Middle Ages</em>, and his <em>Constitutional History</em>, and we may add, as illustrations of a different kind, <em>The Annals of the Stage</em> of our excellent friend Mr. Collier, and <em>The Handbook of London</em> of our valued contributor Mr. Peter Cunningham, as examples of the sort of publications to which we allude. Such were the books we had in our mind, when we spoke in our prospectus of the “Notes and Queries” becoming, through the inter-communication of our literary friends, “a most useful supplement to works already in existence —a treasury towards enriching future editions of them.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>One concern the Editor is happy to address promptly is making the prospectus available as a note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Another correspondent —a bibliographical friend —suggests that, for various reasons, which bibliographers will appreciate, our Prospectus should have a place in the body of our work. We believe that many of our readers concur in a wish for its preservation, and it will therefore be found in the Number now before them.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are limits as to what is regarded as in scope, however:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>One suggestion again urges us to look carefully to Foreign Literature, and another points out the propriety of our making our paper as British as possible, so that our topographical facts should, as far as practicable, be restricted to the illustration of British counties, and our biographical ones to such as should contribute towards a Biographia Britannica.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The column closes with a note of gratitude:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>All these, and many other expressions of sympathy and promises of support, poured in upon us within a few hours after our birth. No one of them shall be forgotten ; and if for a time our pages seem to indicate that we have made a Query as to the adoption of any suggestion, let our kind contributors be assured that there is no hint which reaches us, whether at present practicable or not, that we do not seriously and thankfully “ make a Note of.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the third issue, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-17_1_3/page/46/mode/2up">Vol 1 Iss 3</a>, the <em>Notices to Correspondents</em> column,  p46, continued to provide a channel for discussing possible improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Contents and Index
Our correspondents will see that their wish for a Table of Contents to each number has been complied with. We are fully aware how much the value of a work like  “ Notes and Queries” is enhanced by a good Index. It is intended to give a very copious one at the end of each volume, so as to make the work one not merely of temporary interest, but of permanent utility.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Some difficulties in the availaibilty of <em>Notes and Queries</em> were also acknowledged:</p>
<p>We have received many complaints of a difficulty in procuring our paper. Every Bookseller and Newsvender will supply it if ordered, and gentlemen residing in the country may be supplied regularly with the Stamped Edition by giving their orders direct to the publisher, Mr. Grorce Bett, 136. Fleet Street, accompanied by a Post Office order for a quarter (4s, 4d.). All communications should be addressed to the Editor of “Notes and Queries,” 186. Fleet Street.</p>
<p>In the fourth issue, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-24_1_4">Vol 1 Iss 4</a>, Thoms reviewed the progress to date, p49-50, beginning with the decision to publish weekly:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>OUR PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS.</p>
<p>When we consulted our literary friends as to the form and manner in which it would be most expedient to put forth our “NOTES AND QUERIES,” more than one suggested to us that our paper should appear only once a month, or at all events not more frequently than once a fortnight, on the ground that a difficulty would be experienced in procuring materials for more frequent publication. We felt, however, that if such a medium of Inter-communication, as we proposed to establish was, as we believed, really wanted, frequency of publication was indispensable. Nothing but a weekly publication would meet what we believed to be the requirements of literary men. We determined, therefore, to publish a Number every Saturday; and the result has so far justified our decision, that the object of our now addressing our readers is to apologise to the many friends whose communieations we are again unavoidably compelled. to postpone; and to explain that we are preparing to carry out such further improvements in our arrangements as will enable us to find earlier admission for all the communications with which we are favoured.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He also comments on policy to of including comments on, and corrections of, the works of contemporary authors:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>One other word. It has been suggested to us that in inviting Notes, Comments, and Emendations upon the works of Macaulay, Hallam, and other living authors, we may possibly run a risk of offending those eminent men. We hope not. We are sure that this ought not to be the case. Had we not recognised the merits of such works, and the influence they were destined to exercise over men’s minds, we should not have opened our pages for the purpose of receiving, much less have invited, corrections of the mistakes into which the most honest and the most able of literary inquirers must sometimes fall. Only those who have meddled in historical research “an be aware of the extreme difficulty, the all but impossibility, of ascertaining the exact or the whole truth, amidst the numerous minute and often apparently contradictory facts which present themselves to the notice of all inquirers. In this very number a correspondent comments upon an inference drawn by Mr. Hallam from a passage in Mabillon, In inserting such a communication we show the respect we feel for Mr. Hallam, and our sense of the services which he has rendered to historical knowledge. Had we believed that if he has fallen into a mistake in this instance, it had been not merely a mistake, but a deliberate perversion of the truth, we should have regarded both book and writer with indifference, not to say with contempt. It is in the endeavour to furnish corrections of little unavoidable slips in such good honest books — albeit imperfect as all books must be — that we hope at once to render good service to our national literature, and to show our sense of the genius, learning, and research which have combined to enrich it by the production of works of such high character and lasting influence.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The same issue, published November 24th, 1849, at <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-24_1_4/page/50/mode/2up">p51-2</a>, included a letter regarding “commonplace” style contibutions,:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>ADVERSARIA,</p>
<p>[In our Prospectus we spoke of Notes and Queries becoming everybody’s common-place book. The following very friendly letter from an unknown correspondent, G. J.K., urges us to carry out such an arrangement.</p>
<p>Sir,—-I beg leave to forward you a contribution for your “ Notes and Queries,” a periodical which is, I conceive, likely to do a vast deal of good by bringing literary men of all shades of opinion into closer juxtaposition than they have hitherto been.</p>
<p>I would, however, suggest that in future numbers a space might be allotted for the reception of those articles (short of course), which students and literary men in general, transfer to their common-place books ; such as notices of scarce or curious books, biographical or historical curiosities, remarks on ancient or obsolete customs, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Literary men are constantly meeting with such in the course of their reading, and how much better would it be if, instead of transferring them to a MS. book to be seen only by themselves, or perhaps a friend or two, they would forward them to a periodical, in which they might be enshrined in imperishable pica; to say nothing of the benefits such a course of proceeding would confer on those who might not have had the same facilities of gaining the information thus made public.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As an example, G. J. K. included some observations of his own:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In pursuance of this suggestion I have forwarded the inclosed paper, and should be happy, from time to time, to contribute such gleanings from old authors, &amp;c. as I might think worth preserving. G. J. K.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms was happy to oblige in the publication of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We readily comply with G. J. K.’s suggestion, and print, as the first of the series, his interesting communication, entitled]</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Writers of Notes on Fly-leaves, &amp;c.
…</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <em>Notices to Correspondents</em> of that issue, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-11-24_1_4/page/62/mode/2up">p63</a>, including what appear to be some words of chastisement regarding an upublished communication:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Surely Melanion is too hard upon our correspondents and too exigeant towards ourselves. He would place us in a singular position. He should consider that we have not opened lists for all comers to tilt against each other. We invite litterateurs to a re-union, in which they may give and receive mutual help and aid; but, in order to do so, they must tolerate each others’ little peculiarities, and not espy offence in them.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A contribution from the same correspondent is also publicly declined:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Index so kindly offered by Melanion is declined with many thanks.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A week later, on December 1st, 1849, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-12-01_1_5/page/78/mode/2up?q=enlarge+circulation">Vol 1 Iss 5, p79</a>, and one of the notices to correspondents thanks one contributor for their efforts in helping grow circulation, as well as encouraging others to do the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Philo is thanked for his proposed endeavours to enlarge our circulation. We trust all our friends and correspondents will follow Philo’s example by bringing Notes and Queries to the notice of such of their friends as take an interest in literary pursuits. For it is obvious that they will understand the usefulness of our Paper, in proportion as they increase its circulation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For some reason, Thoms felt it necessary to explain this call to action the following week, in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-12-08_1_6">Vol 1 Iss 6, p.81</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A FEW WORDS OF EXPLANATION.</p>
<p>It was in no boastful or puffing spirit that, when thanking a correspondent in our last number for “his endeavour to enlarge our circulation,” and requesting all our friends and correspondents “ to follow Philo’s example by bringing ‘Notes and Queries’ under the notice of such of their friends as take an interest in literary pursuits,” we added “for it is obvious that they will extend the usefulness of our paper in proportion as they increase its circulation.” We wished merely to state a plain obvious fact. Such must necessarily be the case, and our experience proves it to be so; for the number of Queries which have been solved in our columns, has gone on increasing in proportion to the gradual increase of our circulation ; —a result which fully justifies that passage of our opening address which stated, “that we did not anticipate any holding back by those whose Notes were most worth having.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>He justifies the “value-add” of increasing the readership by commenting on what that readership brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>No sooner is information asked for through our medium, than a host of friendly pens are busied to From north, south, east, and west, — from quarters the most unlooked for, do we receive Notes and Illustrations of every subject which is mooted in out pages. Many of these replies, too, though subscribed only with an initial or a pseudonym, we know to be furnished by scholars who have won the foremost rank in their respective branches of study. Such men manifest, by their willingness to afford information to those who need it, and their readiness to receive it from those who have it to bestow, the truthfulness of old Chaucer’s portrait of the Scholar : —</p>
<p>“Ful gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms also hints at the reach already achieved:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Nor do our columns exhibit the total result of our labours. Besides the information communicated to ourselves, friends who inserted Queries under their own names, answers to them without our intervention.</p>
<p>In addition to those friends who promised us receive communications from their assistance, we receive communication from quarters altogether unexpected. Our present number furnishes a striking instance of this, in the answer to Mr. Bruce’s inquiry respecting the “Monmouth Ash,” kindly communicated by the Earl of Shaftesbury, its distinguished owner.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And suggests that growing the reach can only improve things further:</p>
<p>We trust that each successive paper shows improvement in our arrangements, and proves also that our means of procuring answers to the Queries addressed to us are likewise increasing. In the belief that such is the case, we feel justified in repeating, even at the risk of being accused of putting in <em>two</em> words for ourselves under the semblance of <em>one</em> for our readers, “that it is obvious that our friends will extend the usefulness of our paper in proportion as they increase its circulation.”</p>
<p>In the issue before Christmas, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-12-22_1_8/page/126/mode/2up">Vol 1 Iss 8, p127</a>, we get the impression that some correspondents are high maintenance:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Melanion and other valued contributors are begged not to suppose their contributions are declined because they are postponed. We have procured the book Melanion has referred us to, and hope in the course of two or three weeks to bring the subject forward in a manner to give general satisfaction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the final issue of the year, dated December 29th, 1849, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-12-29_1_9">Vol 1 Iss 9, p128-9</a>, Thoms acknowledges that the early success of the periodical has caused some availability problems, particularly amongst readers who perhaps missed the initial issues, but sees this as a reason to celebrate:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>OUR PROGRESS.</p>
<p>We have this week been called upon to take a step which neither our best friends nor our own hopes could have anticipated. Having failed our endeavours to supply by other means the increasing demand for complete sets of our “ Notes And Queries,” we have been compelled to reprint the first four numbers.</p>
<p>It is with no slight feelings of pride and satisfaction that we record the fact of a large impression of a work like the present not having been sufficient to meet the demand, — a work devoted not to the witcheries of poetry or to the charms of romance, but to the illustration of matters of graver import, such as obscure points of national history, doubtful questions of literature and bibliography, the discussion of questionable etymologies, and the elucidation of old world customs and observances.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms also acknowledges the contributory and co-operative nature of the enterprise:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What Mr. Kemble lately said so well with reference to archeology, our experience justifies us in applying to other literary inquiries : —</p>
<p>“On every side there is evidence of a generous and earnest co-operation among those who have devoted themselves to special pursuits; and not only does this tend of itself to widen the general basis, but it supplies the individual thinker with an ever widening foundation for his own special study.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>before reflecting on the driving force for this support:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And whence arises this “ earnest co-operation ?” Is it too much to hope that it springs from an increased reverence for the Truth, from an intenser craving after a knowledge of it— whether such Truth regards an event on which pended, or the etymology of some household word now familiar only to</p>
<p>“ Hard-handed men who work in Athens here ?”</p>
<p>We feel that the kind and earnest men who honour our “Notes and Queries” with their correspondence, hold with Bacon that</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“ Truth, which only doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of Truth, which is the love-making or wooing of it — the knowledge of Truth, which is the presence of it —and the belief of Truth, which is the enjoying of it — is the sovereign good of human nature.”</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We believe that it is under the impulse of such feelings that they have flocked to our columns — that that sentiment found its echo in the breast of the public, and hence that success which has attended our humble efforts. The cause is so great, that we may well be pardoned if we boast that we have had both hand and heart in it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms closes with his season’s greetings:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And so, with all the earnestness and heartiness which befit this happy season, when</p>
<p>“ No spirit stirs abroad ;<br />
The nights are wholesome ; when no planet strikes,<br />
No fairy takes, no witeh hath power to charm,<br />
So hallow’d and so gracious is the time,”</p>
<p>do we greet all our friends, whether contributors or readers, with the good old English wish,</p>
<p>A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Finally, in the notices to correspondents of that final issue of the year, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1849-12-29_1_9/page/142/mode/2up">p143</a>, a notice regarding availability that was also to regularly appear in later issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have to explain to correspondents who inquire as to the mode of procuring “Notes and Queries,” that every bookseller and newsman will supply it, if ordered, and that gentlemen residing in the country may be supplied regulurly with the Stamped Edition, by giving their orders direct to the publisher, Mr, George Bell, 186. Fleet Street, accompanied by a Post Office order for a Quarter (4s, 4d.).</p>

<h2>The Second Volume<a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-volume" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>With the launch of the second volume of <em>Notes and Queries</em> on June 1st, 1850, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1850-06-01_2_31/page/n1/mode/2up">Vol 2 Iss 31, p1</a>, the editor took the opportunity of this milestone to reflect on progress to date.</p>
<p>The editor took the opportunity of such a milestone to reflect on the journey so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>OUR SECOND VOLUME.</p>
<p>We cannot resist the opportunity which the commencement of our Second Volume affords us, of addressing a few words of acknowledgement to our friends, both contributors and readers. In the short space of seven months, we have been enabled by their support to win for “Notes and Queries” no unimportant position among the litereary journals of this country. We came forward for the purpose of affording the literary brotherhood of this great nation an organ through  which they might announce their difficulties and requiremetnts, through which such difficulties might find solution, and such requirements be supplied. The little band of kind friends who first rallied round us has been reinforced by a host of earnest men, who, at once recognising the utility of our purpose, and seeing in our growing prosperity how much love of letters existed among us, have joined us heart and hand in the great object we proposed to ourselves in our Prospectus; namely, that of making “NOTES AND QUERIES “ by mutual intercommunication, “a most useful supplement to works already in existence—a treasury for enriching future editions of them — and an important contribution towards a more perfect history than we yet possess of our language, our literature, and those to whom we owe them.”</p>
<p>Thanks, again and again, to the friends and correspondents, who, by their labours, are enabling us to accomplish this great end. To them be the honour of the work. We are content to say with the Arabian poet:</p>
<p>“ With conscious pride we view the band<br />
Of faithful friends that round us stand;<br />
With pride exult, that we alone<br />
Can join these scattered gems in one ;<br />
Rejoiced to be the silken line<br />
On which these pearls united shine. “</p>

<section id="precursors-to-notes-and-queries">
<h2>Precursors to Notes and Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#precursors-to-notes-and-queries" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Opening the pages of <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1850-08-24_2_43/mode/2up">Vol 2 Iss 43, p193-4</a>, dated August 24th, 1850, appears a note that reflects on on other works that have concerned themselves with providing answers to submitted questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTES AND QUERIES.</p>
<p>The history of books and periodicals of a similar character ought to be an object of interest to the readers of this work. The number of works in which answers have been given to proposed questions is not small. Not to mention the <em>Spectator</em> and its imitators, nor the class of almanacs which give riddles and problems, nor mathematical periiodicals of a more extensive character, —though all these ought to be discussed in course of time, — there yet remains a class of books in which general questions proposed by the public are answered periodically, either by the public or by the editors. Perhaps an account of one of these may bring out others.</p>
<p>In 1736 and 1737 appeared the <em>Weekly Oracle</em> ; or, <em>Universal Library. Published by a Society of Gentlemen</em>. One folio sheet was published weekly, usually ending in the middle of a sentence. (Query. What is the technical name for this mode of publication? If none, what ought to be?) I have one folio volume of seventy numbers, at the end of which notice of suspension is given, with prospect of revival in another form: probably no more was published.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The correspondent also shares the authority by which the <em>Weekly Oracle</em> provided it’s replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The introduction is an account of the editorial staff: to wit, a learned divine who “hath entered with so much discernment into the true spirit of the schoolmen, especially Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, that he is qualified to resolve, to a hair’s breadth, the nicest cases of conscience.” A physician who “ knows, to a mathematical point, the just tone and harmony of the rising pulses… .” A lawyer who “what he this day has proved to be a contingent remainder, to-morrow he will with equal learning show must operate as an executory devise or as a springing use.” A philosopher “ able to give the true reason of all things, from the composition of watches, to the raising of minced pies … and who, if he is closely questioned about the manner of squaring the circle, or by what means the perpetual motion, or longitude, may be discovered, we believe has honesty, and we are sure that he has skill enough to say that he knows nothing of the matter.” A moral philosopher who has “discovered a <em>perpetuum mobile</em> of government.” An eminent virtuoso who understands “what is the best pickle to preserve a rattle-snake or an Egyptian mummy, better than the nature of the government he lives under, or the economy and welfare of himself and family.” Lastly, a <em>man of mode</em>. “Him the beaus and the ladies may consult in the affairs of love, dress, and equipage.”</p>
<p>There is a great deal of good answering to tolerably rational questions, mixed with some attempts at humour, and other eccentricities, and occasionally a freedom, both of question and answer, by which we might, were it advisable, confirm the fact, that the decorums of 1736 and 1850 are two different things.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Several example questions and answers are then provided, before closing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>So much for some of the “ Notes and Queeries” (as the word ought to be spelt) of a century ago.<br />
M.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Three weeks later, another correspondent supplies the names of several other publications that were also engaged in promoting queries and answers, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1850-09-14_2_46/page/242/mode/2up">Vol 2 Iss 46, p242-3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTES AND QUERIES. “There is nothing new under the sun,” quoth
the Preacher; and such must be said of “ Notes and Queries.” Your contributor M. (Vol. ii, p. 194.) has drawn attention to the <em>Weekly Oracle</em>, which in 1736 gave forth its responses to the inquiring public ; but, as he intimates, many similar periodicals might be instanced. Thus, we have <em>Memoirs for the Ingenious</em>, 1693, 4to., edited by I. de la Crose; <em>Memoirs for the Curious</em>, 1701, 4to.; <em>The Athenian Oracle</em>, 1704, 8vo.; <em>The Delphick Oracle</em>, 1720, 8vo.; <em>The British Apollo</em>, 1740, 12mo. ; with several others of less note. The three last quoted answer many singular questions in theology, law, medicine, physics, natural history, popular superstitions, &amp;c., not always very satisfactorily or very intelligently, but still, often amusingly and ingeniously. <em>The British Apollo: containing two thousand Answers to curious Questions in most Arts and Sciences, serious, comical, and humourous</em>, the fourth edition of which I have now before me, indulges in answering such questions as these: “ How old was Adam when Eve was created ? — Is it lawful to eat black pudding ? — Whether the moon in Ireland is like the moon in England? Where is hell situated? Do cocks lay eggs?” &amp;c. In answer to the question, “ Why is gaping catching?” the Querisis of 1740 are gravely told, —</p>
<p>“Gaping or yawning is infectious, because the steams of the blood being ejected out of the mouth, doth infect the ambient air, which being received by the nostrils into another man’s mouth, doth irritate the fibres of the hypogastric muscle to open the mouth to discharge by expiration the unfortunate gust of air infected with the steams of blood, as aforesaid.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Several more examples then follow, before the correspondent closes with the observation that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[a] readable volume might be compiled from these “ Notes and Queries,” which amused our grandfathers; and the works I have indicated will afford much curious matter in etymology, folk-lore, topography, &amp;c., to the modern antiquary.<br />
Corkscrew.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The same sentiment probably holds true today, even if only in the publication of a lighthearted Christmas stocking-filler of a book.</p>

<section id="the-first-anniversary">
<h2>The First Anniversary<a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-anniversary" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A few months later, and the first anniversary issue, on October 26th, 1850, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1850-10-26_2_52/mode/2up">Vol 2 Iss 52, p353-4</a> provided another opportunity for reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>ADDRESS TO OUR FRIENDS.</p>
<p>WE this day publish our fifty-second Number. Every Saturday, for twelve months, have we presented to our subscribers our weekly budget of “ Notes,” “Queries,” and “ Replies;” in so doing, we trust, we have accomplished some important ends. We have both amused and instructed the general reader ;  we have stored up much curious knowledge for the use of future writers ; we have procured for scholars now engaged in works of learning and research many valuable pieces of information which had evaded their own immediate pursuit; and, lastly, in doing all this, we have powerfully helped forward the great cause of literary truth.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms recalls that the intention was to let <em>Notes and Queries</em> speak for itself in terms of what it was, rather than try to define it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In our Prospectus and opening address we made no great promise of what our paper should be. That, we knew, must depend upon how far the medium of inter-communication we have prepared should be approved and adopted by those for whose special use it had been projected. We laid down a literary railway: it remained to be seen whether the world of letters would travel by it. They have done so: we have been especially patronised by first-class passengers, and in such numbers that we were obliged last week to run an extra train.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A large part of the success of such a “medoum for inter-communication” would also rely on developing a wide network of readers, a challenge that had met with no small amount of success:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is obvious that the use of a paper like “NOTES AND QUERIES” bears a direct proportion to the extent of its circulation. What it aims at doing is, to reach the learning which lies scattered not only throughout every part of our own country, but all over the literary world, and to bring it all to bear upon the pursuits of the scholar; to enable, in short, men of letters all over the world to give a helping hand to one another. To a certain extent, we have accomplished this end. Our last number contains communications not only from all parts of the metropolis, and from almost every county in England, but also from Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and even from Demerara. This looks well. It seems as if we were in a fair way to accomplish our design. But much yet remains to be done. We have recently been told of whole districts in England so benighted as never to have heard of “NOTES AND QUERIES;” and after an interesting question has been discussed for weeks in our columns, we are informed of some one who could have answered it immediately if he had seen it. So long as this is the case the advantage we may confer upon literature and literary men is necessarily imperfect. We do what we can to make known our existence through the customary modes of announcement, and we gratefully acknowledge the kind assistance and encouragement we derive from our brethren of the public press ; but we would respectfully solicit the assistance of our friends upon this particular point. Our purpose is aided, and our usefulness increased by every introduction which can be given to our paper, either to a Book Club, to a Lending Library, or to any other channel of circulation amongst persons of inquiry and intelligence. By such introductions scholars help themselves as well as us, for there is no inquirer throughout the kingdom who is not occasionally able to throw light upon some of the multifarious objects which are discussed in our pages.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The remarks end with a vote of thanks:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At the end of our first twelvemonth we thank our subscribers for the patronage we have received. We trust we shall go on week by week improving in our work of usefulness, so that at the end of the next twelvemonth me may meet them with the same pleasure as on the present occasion. We will continue to do whatsoever is in our power, and we rely upon our  friends to help us.</p>

<section id="a-dutch-version-of-notes-and-queries">
<h2>A Dutch Version of Notes and Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#a-dutch-version-of-notes-and-queries" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As a medium of inercommunication, Note and Queries seemed to have found its niche. The success of the journal was noted elsewhere, and in the issue of Fenruary 1st, 1851, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1851-02-01_3_66/mode/2up">Vol 3 Iss 66, p81-82</a> a note appeared announcing a Dutch magazine modeled directly on <em>Notes and Queries</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>To the Editor of “Notes and Queries.”</p>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>We have the pleasure of sending you the prospectus of “De Navorscher,” a new Dutch periodical, grounded upon the same principle as its valuable and valiant predecessor, “ Notes and Queries.” The title, when translated into English, would be — <em>“ The Searcher; a medium of intellectual exchange and literary intercourse between all who know something, have to ask something, or can solve something.”</em> If it be glorious for you to have proposed a good example, we think it honourable for us to follow it.</p>
<p>Though we do not wish to be our own trumpets, we can say that never a Dutch newspaper was greeted, before its appearance, by such favourable prognostics. Your idea, Mr. Editor, was received with universal applause; and Mr. Frederik Muller, by whom “ De Navorscher” will be published, is not only a celebrated bookseller, but also one of our most learned <em>bookmen</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The editor of the Dutch edition also proposed a means by which Dutch and the English publications could also inter-communicate:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ready to promote by every means in our power the friendly intercourse between your country and our fatherland, we desire of you to lay the following plan before the many readers of “ Notes and Queries.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Every Query, which, promulgated by our English sister, would perhaps find a solution when meeting the eyes of <em>Dutch</em> readers, will be TRANSLATED for them by her foreign brother. We promise to send you a version of the eventual answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Of Queries, divulged in “De Navorscher,” and likely to be answered if translated for the British readers of “ Notes and Queries,” a <em>version</em> will be presented by us to the sister-periodical.</p></li>
<li><p>The title of Books or Odd Votumes wanted to purchase, of which copies may exist in the Netherlands, will be duly inserted into “De Navorscher” when required. Mr. Frederik Muller will direct his letters, containing particulars and lowest price, to the persons anxious for information.</p></li>
<li><p>All communications for “De Navorscher “ must be addressed to Mr. D. Nutt, Bookseller, No. 270. Strand ; or, <em>carriage free</em>, to the “<em>Directors</em> of the same,” care of Mr. Frederick Muller, “ Heerengracht, near the Oude Speigelstraat, Amsterdam.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With a fervent wish that in such two neighbourly nations, connected by religion, commerce, and literary pursuits, may be more and more united by the mail-bearing sea which divides them, we have the honour to remain,<br />
Mr. Editor,<br />
Your respectful servants,<br />
The Directors or “ De Navorscher.” Amsterdam, the 16th of December, 1850.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thoms received the letter with much appreciation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When by the publication of “Notes and Queries” we laid down those telegraphic lines of literary communication which we hoped should one day find their way into every library and book-room in the United Kingdom, we little thought that, ere fifteen months had passed, we should be called upon, not to lay down a submarine telegraph, but to establish a supermarine communication with our brethren in the Low Countries. We do so most gladly, for we owe them much. From them it was that Caxton learned the art, but for which “Notes ann Queries” would never have existed ; and of which the unconstrained practice has, under Providence, served to create aur literature, to maintain our liberties, and to win for England its exalted position among the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>Heartily, therefore, do we bid God speed to “De Navorscher ;” and earnestly will we do all we can to realise the kindly wish of our Amsterdam brethren, that the “two neighbourly nations of Holland and England, connected by religion, commerce, and literary pursuits, may be more and more united by the mail-bearing sea which divides them.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the face of what was presumably a growing incoming mail bag from his own subscribers, Thoms seems to have felt it necessary in the <em>notices to correspondents</em> sectin of that same edition to remind corrspondents of best practice in their submissions that would make his life easier:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have two or three favours to request of our correspondents, and we ask them no less for their sakes than for our own. 1st. That they will be particular in their references, and collate their extracts before sending them to us ; for they little know the loss of time and the trouble which a neglect of these trifles occasions us. 2nd. That they will forward their separate articles as far as possible on separate papers ; for several valuable communications are now standing over, until we can find leisure to separate and arrange for the press the different parts. 3rd. That they will write as legibly as they can.</p>

<h2>The Second Anniversary Address<a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-anniversary-address" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Two years on from the first issue of <em>Notes and Queries</em>, and Thoms made his second anniversary address in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1851-11-01_4_105/mode/2up">Vol 4 Iss 105</a>, dated Novemeber 1st, 1851, p337-8:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THE CLAIMS OF LITERATURE</p>
<p>This day two years, on presenting to the public, and to the Literary Men of England, the first number of “Notes and Queries”, as “a medium by which much valuable information might become a sort of common property among those who can appreciate and use it,” we ventured to say, “ We do not anticipate any holding back by those whose ‘Notes’ are most worth having, or any want of ‘Queries’ from those best able to answer them. Whatever may be the case in other things, it is certain that those who are best informed are generally the most ready to communicate knowledge and to confess ignorance, to feel the value of such a work, as we are attempting, and to understand that, if it is to be well done, they mut help to do it. Some thought is certainly wanted by those who are engaged in Literature, Art, and Science; and we only hope to persuade the best men in all, that we offer them the best medium of communication with each other.”</p>
<p>How fully these anticipations have been realised, how all the “best men” have come forward, we acknowledge with feelings of gratitude and pride. May we now hope that, in thus forming one fresh bond of union among the lovers and professors of Literature in this country, we have contributed towards a recognition of Literature as an honourable profession, and hastened the time when Science, and Art to some of those honorary distinctions hiterto exclusively conferred upon the Naval, Military, or Civil Servants of the Crown, will be admitted and acted upon, For as we hold with Chaucer,</p>
<p>“That he is gentil who doth gentil dedes;”</p>
<p>so we would have those men especially honoured, whose “gentil dedes” in Litereature, Science and Art tend to elevate the minds, and thereby promote the happiness of their fellow-men.</p>
<p>That gallant gentleman, Captain Sword, whose good services we readily acknowledge, has hiterto monopolized all the honours which the sovereign has thought proper to distribute. We would fain see good Master Pen now take his fair share of them <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[We</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">glad</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">find</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">views</span> <span class="pre">we</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">here</span> <span class="pre">advocated,</span> <span class="pre">have</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">support</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">leading</span> <span class="pre">journal</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Europe.</span> <span class="pre">Vide</span> <span class="pre">*The</span> <span class="pre">Times*</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Wednesday</span> <span class="pre">last]</span></code>: and the present moment, when Peace has just celebrated her Jubilee in the the presence of admiring millions, is surely the fittest moment that could be selected for the establishment of some Order (call it of Victoria, or Civil Merit, or what you will) to honour those followers of the Arts of Peace to whose genius, learning, and skill the great event of the year 1851 owes its brilliant conception, its happy execution, its triumphant success.</p>
<p>The reign of the Illustrious Lady who now fills with so much dignity the Throne of these Realms, has hap-pily been pre-eminently distinguished (and long may it be so!) by an unexampled progress made in all the Arts of Peace, Her Majesty has been pre-eminently a Patron of all such Arts. How graceful then, on the part of Her Majesty, would be the immediate institution of an Order of Civil Merit! How gratifying to those accomplished and worthy men on whom Her Majesty might be pleased to confer it!</p>

<div><p>OUR SIXTH VOLUME.</p>
<p>Milton describes the active and industrious emmet as “ provident Of future ; in small room large heart inclos’d.”</p>
<p>What authority there may be for the asserted physiological fact in reference to the emmet, is a Query we submit to our readers, merely reminding them that Virgil has said the same thing of bees: at present we quote the words of our great poet as descriptive of the function and purpose which we have carried on throughout Five Volumes, and which we shall keep steadily before us in that new Volume on which we are this day entering, and in the numberless remainder which we trust will follow. “ Provident of future,” we shall lay up good store of valuable materials for all inquirers ; and within the “small room” of our hebdomadal sheet shall strive to inclose a mass of matter more directly useful to literary men than has ever been crowded into such space before.</p>
<p>The continued kindness of our “ increased and still increasing” band of contributors and correspondents enables us, volume by volume, to perform our office more perfectly. The number of important questions which we answer immediately, and the number cleared up by the friendly discussions in our pages, are both continually on the increase. Some day we shall (in Parliamentary phrase) present a Return upon this subject which will excite no little surprise: at present we will merely express our warmest thanks to all our contributing friends, and assure them of our constant endeavour to insert their papers in the way which will be most useful, and at the same time most agreeable to themselves. Slight curtailment, and some delay, are occasionally unavoidable; but we studiously endeavour to do the most entire justice to every paper that is sent to us, and that as quickly as possible. Such shall ever continue to be our aim; our only “strife” being how to please you all —— readers, correspondents, note-makers, and querists — “ day exceeding day.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And at the start of the eleventh volume, on January 6th, 1855, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1855-01-06_11_271/page/n1/mode/2up">Vol 11 Iss 271, p1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>OUR ELEVENTH VOLUME.</p>
<p>On the commencement of our eleventh volume our thanks are particularly due to our kind Friends, Contributors, and Readers. Their continued and increasing gratitude. May 1855 be a happy and prosperous New Year to them— one and all!</p>
<p>The Volumes of “Notes and Queries” published during the past year have contributed in many ways, and in no unimportant manner, to the illustration of our Language, Literature, and History. No effort shall be wanting to make volume the now commenced equally interesting to the Reader of the present day, and not less likely to be profitable to those who may hereafter refer to it.</p>
<p>Need WE promise more? And does not the number to which WE now invite the Reader’s attention, justify our saying thus much ?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The opening address at the start of the thirteenth volume, consecutively counted, in the first week of 1856, (Saturday, January 5th) was actually identified as <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1856-01-05_1_1/page/n1/mode/2up">Series 2, Vol 1 Iss 1</a> of the *Second Series&amp;. The move to a second series, in part, seems to be motivated by providing subscribers who perhaps missed out on the easily issues, the chance to collect a “complete work”.</p>
<p>The address began with a review of the progress to date, and a vote of thanks to the continued support of the readership, p1:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>OUR NEW VOLUME.</p>
<p>On commencing our Thirteenth Volume, we must be permitted a few words of self-gratulation on the progress which “Notes &amp; Queries” has made, and the position it has attained since November 3, 1849, when the first Number of it was submitted to the Reading World.</p>
<p>We have the less scruple in referring with pride to our success, because, whatever merit may attach to the idea on which “N. &amp; Q.” is founded, that success is chiefly to be attributed to the kindly spirit in which our friends and correspondents have come forward to help this Journal and one another. And not the least gratifying result of the establishment of “N. &amp; Q.,” has been the interchange of which it has been the medium ; not only of friendly offices—of books—and of ofher literary assistance — but even, in some cases, of more substantial benefits among parties whose first acquaintance has originated in our columns. Lord Monson’s very graceful allusion to this characteristic of “ N. &amp; Q.” in the Number of the 8th Dec. last, is but one of many such instances which have come to our knowledge.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, there is perhaps a slight nod towards those readers who have not always seen eye to eye with the editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This friendly spirit on the part of our correspondents, has greatly facilitated our editorial labours. But with all the care and tact that we can exercise, we know too well that we cannot at all times expect to please all readers. We are happy to acknowledge, however, that our endeavours to gratify their varied tastes have, on the whole, been very successful. We hope in future to be yet more so: especially if they will bear in mind the advice of the learned and witty Erasmus:</p>
<p>“ A reader should sit down to a book, especially of the miscellaneous kind, as a well-behaved visitor does to a banquet. The master of the feast exerts himself to satisfy his guests; but if, after all his care and pains, something should appear on the table that does not suit this or that person’s taste, they politely pass it over without notice, and commend other dishes, that they may not distress a kind host.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The address closes with a few remarks relating to the commencement of the new series:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>But we are occupying space for ourselves which we would rather see occupied by our Correspondents, One remark, however, we must find room for. We have spoken of this as our Thirteenth Volume, as indeed it is; but, in compliance with a wish urged upon us from many quarters, we have made it the first of a New Series: that they who may now wish to subscribe to “ N. &amp; Q.,” may have the opportunity of doing so; without, on the one hand, having an incomplete work, or, on the other, incurring the expence of purchasing the back volumes.<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A</span> <span class="pre">very</span> <span class="pre">elaborate</span> <span class="pre">Index</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">first</span> <span class="pre">Twelve</span> <span class="pre">Volumes</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">forward</span> <span class="pre">state</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">preparation.]</span></code> We may hope the Series now commenced in the same spirit, and, as it will be seen, in a great measuré by the same friendly hands, will be received with the favour so kindly bestowed upon its predecessor. That it may deserve such favour, we will spare no efforts. And so, Gentle Reader, we bid you heartily Farewell.</p>

<h2>Mutterings About Anonymity<a class="headerlink" href="#mutterings-about-anonymity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Towards the end of 1856, in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1856-11-15_2_46/page/382/mode/2up">Series 2, Vol 2 Iss 46</a>, at the close of their note on “CHURCHING PLACE”, p382, one correspondent saw fit to call for the full naming of correspondents who submitted notes,:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>…
I would suggest that “N. &amp; Q.” would have great additional value, if the contributors of Notes (Queries do not signify) would give their names. In a late Number (p. 333.) some most curious books are referred to, as “in my possession,” and the writer signs by initials. How much better if he gave his name. And information, with the name of a good antiquary attached to it, can be quoted in other works, as “it is stated by Mr. Greaves,” or “Mr. Bernhard Smith,” and the like.  F. A. Carrington</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This prompted a reply in the issue of three weeks later, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1856-12-06_2_49/page/456/mode/2up">Series 2, Vol 2 Iss 49</a>, p457:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Contributors’ Names (2nd S. ii. 382.) — Mr. CARRINGTON’s proposition that contributors to “ N. &amp; Q.” should affix their names to their articles, though plausible enough, would, I believe, be eventually the ruin of the undertaking. Those who please may, and many do sign, and others who give no name are as well known as if they did; but as a general rule the absence of the name is, I am satisfied, best. It tends to brevity — it obviates personalities — it allows a freer intercommunication of opinion and criticism. Contributors under the initials of B. J. or R. would be less touchy and less obstinate — less unwilling to ask or receive instruction or correction —than if they had to maintain a public discussion in their proper names and characters as Mr. Brown, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Robinson. It is the same principle of maintaining order and good humour in debate that prohibits in Parliament the use of “ Honourable Members’” proper names. If we were all to give our names “N. &amp; Q.” would, in three weeks, be a cock-pit !</p>

<h2>Choice Notes From The First Series<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-notes-from-the-first-series" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As the first series came to an end, the opportunity to publish “collected highlights” was not lost on Thoms:</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Choice notes, 1858</p>
<p>History. Choice notes from ‘Notes and queries’.
by Notes and queries, 1858, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/historychoiceno00quergoog">p.v-vi</a></p>
<p>PREFACE.</p>
<p>On the completion of the First Series of Notes and Queries, it was suggested from many quarters, that a selection of the more curious articles scattered through the twelve volumes would be welcome to a numerous body of readers. It was said that such a selection, judiciously made, would not only add to a class of books of which we have too few in English literature, — we mean books of the pleasant gossiping character of the French Ana for the amusement of the general reader, — but would serve in some measure to supply the place of the entire series to those who might not possess it.</p>
<p>It has been determined to carry out this idea by the publication of a few small volumes, each devoted to a particular subject. The first, which is here presented to the reading world, is devoted to History : and we trust that whether the reader looks at the value of the original documents here reprinted, or the historical truths here established, he will be disposed to address the book in the words of Cowper, sO happily suggested bj Mr. Peter Cunningham as the appropriate motto of Notes and Queries itself, —</p>
<p>By thee I might correct, erroneous offt,<br />
The clock of History — facts and events<br />
Timing more punctual, unrecorded facts<br />
Recoveringy and mis-stated setting right.</p>
<p>While on the other hand the volume, from its miscellaneous character, will, we hope, be found an acceptable addition to that pleasant class of books which Horace Walpole felicitously describes as “ lounging books, books which one takes up in the gout, low spirits, ennui, or when one is waiting for company.”</p>

<p>In passing, we note that <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1858-03-06_5_114/page/198/mode/2up">Series 2, Vol 5 Iss 114, p199</a> of March 6th, 1858, recognised the launch of an American version of Notes and Queries”:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We have this week to introduce to our Readers — and to invite them to give a cordial welcome to a kinsman from across the Atlantic—the First Volume of a work which owes its origin to our own success. The Historical Magazine and Notes and Queries concerning the Antiquities, History, and Biography of America, is so completely modelled after our own journal that to speak in its praise is almost to sound our own. It has, however, withal its own peculiar characteristics: for, although as might well have been the case, seeing that our early literature is also the early literature of our transatlantic brethren, its consideration might occupy a large portion of an American <em>Notes and Queries</em>, the Editor has with great judgment preserved the national character of his journal, and invested it with a thoroughly national interest — a fact which, while it has ensured its success in the States, has added greatly to its use and value to the literary world of England. In conclusion we may remark, that it rivals our own volumes in the completeness of its Index.</p>

<section id="widening-the-remit">
<h2>Widening the Remit<a class="headerlink" href="#widening-the-remit" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Later that same year, 1858, a suggestion appeared in the edition of March 16th, 1858, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1858-10-16_6_146/page/306/mode/2up">Series 2, Vol 6 Iss 146, p307-8</a> that the pages of <em>notes and Queries</em> relating to how the publication might be underestimating its ability to co-ordinate information gathering activities further, by providing reciprocating, “on-the-ground” researches, at a local level, in the particular matter of genealogical research.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A SUGGESTION.</p>
<p>Your valuable periodical is, as stated on the cover, a medium of inter-communication between Literary Men, Artists, Antiquaries, Genealogists, &amp;ec., and a most excellent paper it is in every respect ; but I believe it is capable of being made yet more useful to the latter class, and at the same time to widely increase its already great circulation ; so as to be, not only as it is now, of the greatest possible aid and assistance, but utterly indispensable.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The correspondent teases they have a solution, to a problem they they then state:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Will you allow me to suggest the means ?</p>
<p>We all know how much of late genealogy has become a general study, and consequently what numbers are interested in it. We know that inquirers now no longer are satisfied with the pedigrees of exorbitant price compiled from evidences in the College of Arms, and without references to accessible proofs, but wish to satisfy themselves, and to obtain incontestible and ostensible proofs. We know how many are deterred making investigations, their occupations, and frequently their circumscribed teans, preventing their taking long journeys, or devoting much time to research. We know, also, how very expensive these investigations are (whether into wills or parish register books) when performed even by the most liberal of the clergy or registrars; and also how very difficult it sometimes is to obtain extracts at all.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And the solution to this problem?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I would suggest, then, that you devote one sheet, an additional sheet, to proposals of gentlemen to search for one another, on mutual terms. Thus, a gentleman living at of near a cathedral town, say Chester, requires extracts from records in Carlisle. If this was stated: X. Y. Z., address, wishes extracts from wills in Carlisle, the probability is, some one in Carlisle might desire extracts from evidences in Chester, or probably, some person who pursues the study for pleasure might volunteer his assistance. Or, a gentleman residing in one parish might require extracts from the registers of the very parish in which another resides, who may want extracts out of his parish; or, a person occupied in researches in the British Museum, Tower, and other record-offices, may require extracts from sources, in other places, which others would gladly afford, in return for searches in the places they are engaged in prosecuting searches. They would communicate with one another by letter.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ubdoubtedly, there will be practical considerations to address, not least, presumably, in guaranteeing good faith:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It might be worth while to consider whether this sheet should be closed to all but contributors or known subscribers.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The correspondent is hopeful that the Editor will if he thinks the idea a good one, be supportive of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If you consider this scheme at all practicable, — you would publish it in your next number, in order that the public may give its opinion upon it. Caedo Illud.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>It is perhaps worth noting that this “reciprocating’ support might also work to support research in local museums and archives, as well as other forms of “local fieldwork”.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, a related call-to-action does not appear to be forthcoming in that same issue, nor the following one.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, contributors to <em>Notes and Queries</em> were trying to encourage other publications to offer <em>Notes and Queries</em> style  services, as for example described in this note of November 3rd, 1860, [S. 2, Vol 10 Iss 253, p345]:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Levant Notes anp Queries.— With a view to promote the investigation of the various branche of archeology, ethnology, folk lore, &amp;c. in the Levant, I have prevailed on the editor of the Levant <em>Quarterly Review</em> to imitate “N. &amp; Q.” by instituting L. Q. R. N.&amp; Q. I trust this step may be useful, : such of your readers as are interested in Levant inquiries. Hyde Clarke. Constantinople, Oct.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">See also</p>
<p>See the chapter on <em>“Local Notes and Queries” Columns in Local Newspapers</em>* for more examples of <em>Notes and Queries</em> style columns in local news publications.</p>
</div>
<p>The readership also seem to be self-aware of their far-reaching constituency, a note in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1853-08-10_12_293/page/106/mode/2up">S. 2, Vol 12 Iss 293, p106</a> demonstrates:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Note on “N. &amp; Q.”— I think it worth while to draw your attention to the extensive circulation your excellent little work has attained, by referring solely to one — the last — No. (292), which contains communications from the following places and countries. I select them at random: Arno’s Court; Cork; Cambridge; Fountain Hall, Aberdeen; Zeyst; Poets’ Corner; Port Louis, Mauritius; Edinburgh; Dublin; Bottesford Manor, Brigg; Southampton; China; Brighton; Hammersmith ; Albany, N. Y.; Bekesburne, Oxford, and Smyrna. N. H. R.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Many years later, in the April 13th, 1867, edition, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1867-04-13_11_276/page/292/mode/2up">S. 3, Vol 11 Iss 276, p293 </a>, a suggestion that perhaps pre-empted the completionist way of thinking that was to dominate the activities of the Folk-Lore Sociity, proposed that <em>Notes and Queries</em> indexes <em>every</em> literary mention “in the periodical press”, with the readership excerpting such references and forwarding them to the offices of <em>Notes and Queries</em>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the magnitude of such a task, the suggestion does not appear to have been picked up on.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A Suggestion I wish to make, is, that when any note occurs in the periodical press upon any <em>supercheries littérairés</em>, that such of your readers in the British dominions as happen to see it do forward the same to you: not perhaps fully when too long, but just shortly, so that it may be indexed and at hand when it is required to be referred to. I do not make it part of my suggestion that your columns should be open to such literary waifs, as I am sure they always have been. This has occurred to me in consequence of some <em>supercheries dévoilées</em> in the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> of March 6 instant, relative to novels of <em>Lady Adelaide’s Oath</em> and <em>The Love that Kills</em>. I do not of course in the least comment upon the fact of whether the authors are right or wrong, but simply look upon it as a piece of bibliographical information. The future Quérard of this country, if indeed England is ever to possess so great, so self-denying, so unappreciated a bibliographer, would receive a great aid, and be saved an immense labour by this suggestion being complied with. <em>Ralph Thomas.</em></p>

<section id="on-anonymous-contributions">
<h2>On Anonymous Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#on-anonymous-contributions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Questions relating to anonymous contributions in general resurfaceed in 1864, following what was presumably the “outing” of a reviewer in The Times, who seems to have been forced to shed a cloak of anonymity in favour of a named by-line, with a note in <em>Notes and Queries</em> of March 19th, 1864, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1864-03-19_5_116/page/238/mode/2up">Vol 5 Iss 116, p238</a>. The correspondent was obviously in favour of <em>named</em> contributions, feeling these would add weight to reviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Anonymous Contributions to “N. &amp; Q.”— Mr. Cobden, a gladiator daring the dangers of the arena in defence of another’s political integrity, has compelled the editor of The Times to lay aside the garb of “airy nothing,” and to assume, like other folk, “a local habitation and a name.” Though the struggle has been unseemly in the extreme, though the scheme proposed by that gentleman has been condemned by the fourth estate of the realm, and though it would, if carried out, inevitably destroy the freedom and beneficial influence of the English press, it may yet lead to some suggestions with regard to the anonymous nature of many contributions to “ N. &amp; Q.,” and other publications purely literary. A review would be read with greater avidity if it were known that a Macaulay or a Jeffreys had penned it. In a similar manner the value of this work would, I submit, be increased a hundred fold if all subscribed their names to their communications. It is only after an experience of the usual justness of a writer’s deductions that any weight can be attached to a SHEM, a HERMENTRUDE, or a F.C. H. Nor would the same attention be paid to the ideas or suggestions of a Professor De Morgan, a Lord Lyttelton, or a HALLIWELL, if the authorship of their articles remained a secret. Wynne E. Baxter.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Three weeks later, a counter-view was expressed in <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1864-04-09_5_119/page/306/mode/2up">Vol 5 Iss 119, p307</a> by one of the names mentioned in the previous correspondnt’s note, where the most important consideration was the provenance of the contribution:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Anonymous Contributions to “N,. &amp; Q.” (3rd S. v. 238.) — Doubtless the names of some of your contributors give weight to their communications. But in some instances, such would not be the case, and the anonymous contributors themselves must be supposed to be the best judges. I would suggest that the value of all contributions, whether anonymous or avowed, would be greatly increased by each contributor giving, when practicable, the authority upon which his statements are made, so that any reader may have the opportunity of satisfying himself of their correctness or authenticity, and of judging what weight is due to them. An anonymous and unsupported statement of facts is of little, if any, value.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A critique of what might motivate an anonymous contribution was then provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This question has two sides to it. The anonymous are probably contained, or nearly contained, in three classes: 1. Those who have a feeling —a stronger thing than a reason—against being known. 2. Those who have a reason, either in their official positions, in their relations to the facts they state, &amp;c. 3. Those who write with their names when they desire to give the authority of their names, and expressly desire to avoid giving that authority where they feel that their knowledge of the subject cannot justify them in employing their personal influence. If it were a certainty that all these parties would communicate, in any case, there would perhaps be no harm in pressing publicity upon them. But the real question is this: should an opinion gain ground that all communications ought to be anonymous, would those who now contribute anonymously add their names, or would they cease to communicate? I suspect that a majority would choose the second alternative, to the great disadvantage of the work. The anonymous communicator has no authority ‘until he gains it by the value of his communications’: this is one of the arguments adduced in favour of avowed articles. Is this really in favour of avowal, or against it? The answer is one thing for one reader, another for another: it depends upon the manner in which authority is allowed to act. It must be remembered that so far as a note or reply is only indicative or suggestive, it matters nothing what signature is employed. On the whole, let things remain as they are: and I give this recommendation the more confidently because Iam persuaded things will remain as they are, whether or no. It is always in the power of any one who has 2 good reason, to communicate that reason to the contributor through the editor, and to ask the contributor to allow himself to be privately named. From the notices to correspondents, I should judge that the editor himself does not always know who the contributor is. If so, I should certainly recommend the adoption of the plan followed by many newspapers, which never print anything without being in private possession of the writer’s name. A. De Morgan.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A further reply, in  [Vol 5 Iss 120, p330]<a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1864-04-16_5_120/page/330/mode/2up">https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1864-04-16_5_120/page/330/mode/2up</a>), agreed with de Morgan, but also favourd <em>the editor</em> at least being in possession of each contributor’s name:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Anonymous Contributions To “ N. &amp; Q.” (3rd S. v. 307.) — As others are giving their opinions, perhaps one who has been a contributor from the second volume of the First Series may be allowed a few lines. I concur with all that Professor De Morgan says, except that the editor should “never print anything without being in private possession of the writer’s name.” Had that been the rule, I should never have begun to contribute. Many apparently trifling queries have led to good correspondence, though probably the querists would have thought them too trifling for enclosing their cards. An anonymous statement of facts, I presume, is always rejected. In quoting from books it is desirable that the chapter, page, and edition should be given ; and I have often delayed what seemed to me a satisfactory communication, because I would not quote at second-hand what I might expect to do at first. If a verification is made at the British Museum, the book ticket is a good voucher.</p>
<p>“N. &amp; Q.” has grown too big for lodgings, and is obliged to have a house. With such evidence of thriving, I should think a long time before advising any change. H. B. C. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">H.</span> <span class="pre">B.C.</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">right.</span> <span class="pre">We</span> <span class="pre">share</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">hesitation.—Ed.</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Although not part of the discussion on anonymity, a note on “our Medium or intercommunication” in the edition of September 8th, 1866, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1866-09-08_10_245/page/184/mode/2up">Vol 10 Iss 245, p184</a>, did give a good example of why making correpsondents’ names <em>and addresses</em> available, might provide wider benefit:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Our Medium or Intercommunication.” — From a recent personal experience, and which I consider an exceedingly happy one, I wish to state to the readers and contributors of “ N. &amp; Q.” that the periodical in question is presented to me in an entirely new light—viz. as a medium for introduction to a scholar or gentleman, for any brother-contributor venturing on the privilege of a private correspondence. I am emboldened to prefer this suggestion to the general readers of “N. &amp; Q.” from the fact of having submitted a question of relative importance through the post to a gentleman known only to me by “ making note” of the signature appended to an article in one of its instructive pages: the result of which was a copious supply of the knowledge I so much desiderated, enhanced by the utmost courtesy, and proffers of further valuable assistance. I trust the obvious benefit presented by this statement will condone for the intrusion I have ventured upon, but which is made in the pure spirit of promoting good fellowship, and propagating extended knowledge amongst the readers and contributors of your inexhaustible “ medium of intercommunication.” Edward C. DAVIES.

<p><em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1872-09-28: Vol 10 Iss 248, 4h S. x., <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1872-09-28_10_248">p241</a>:</p>
<p>A PARTING NOTE</p>
<p>There is something very solemn in performing any action under the consciousness that it is for the last time.</p>
<p>Influenced by this feeling it had been my intention that this the last number of NOTES AND QUERIES edited by me should not have contained any intimation that the time had arrived, when I felt called upon to husband my strength and faculties for those official duties which form the proper business of my life.</p>
<p>But the fact having been widely announced, I owe it to myself, and to my sense of what is due to that large body of friends, known and unknown, by whom I have been for three-and-twenty years so ably and generously seconded, to tender them my public andu graeful acknowledgements for their long continued kindnesses.</p>
<p>“With conscious pride I view the band<br />
Of faithful frineds that round me stand;<br />
With pride exult that I alone<br />
Have joined these scattered gems in one ;<br />
On which these pearls united shine.”</p>
<p>The pride is surely a most justifiable one,; and he who could separate himself from the pleasant associations which I have thus enjoyed for nearly a quarter of a century, without deep pain and emotion, must be made of sterner materials than I can boast.</p>
<p>That pain would be yet greater, that emotion yet more deep, did I not feel assured that in resigning my “plumed” sceptre into the hands of Dr. DORAN, I entrust it to one who not only desires to maintain inchanged the general character of this Journal, but will, by his intelligence, courtesy, and good feeling, secure for dear old NOTES AND QUERIES the continued allegiance of those kind and intelligent friends who have made it what it is.</p>
<p>To those friends, one and all, I now with the deepest gratitude, and most earnest wishes for their welfare and hapiness, tend a hearty and affectionate FAREWELL.</p>
<p>WILLIAM J. THOMS.</p>
<p>In publicly acknowledging how grate are my obligations to my accomplished frined MR. JANES YEOWELL, for his valued and long continued assistance, I am doing a simple act of justice which it affords me the highest gratification to perform.</p>

<p><em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1876-07-01: Vol 6 Iss 131 p1, 5th S. VI, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-07-01_6_131/page/n1/mode/2up">p1-2</a>:</p>
<p>THE STORY OF “NOTES AND QUERIES.”</p>
<p>I have often been urged by old friends and contributors to tell the story of the origin of “N. &amp; Q.,” and have as often promised to do so some day.</p>
<p>But when such an appeal as that of the Rev. Richard Hooper (<em>ante</em>, v. 459) is publicly made to me by an old friend who has been a contributor to this journal from its first appearance, and that appeal is backed by the courtesy of Dr. Doran, I feel that the day has come for the fulfilment of my promise. I feel this the more strongly because Mr. Hooper gives me the sole credit of what he is pleased to call the “happy thought”; and common honesty demands that I should remove that impression, and do justice to those dear friends, now unhappily passed away, who had quite as much, if not more to do with the establishment of this journal than I feel justified in laying claim to.</p>
<p>But before proceeding, I must be permitted two words of warning. The first is that the idea of “N. &amp; Q.” was not an inspiration, but rather a development. It did not spring, like Minerva in full panoply, from the brain of its progenitor, but, like Topsy, it “growed.” The second, that when an old gossip of threescore and twelve is asked to narrate the circumstances of the one event of his life by which he is ever likely to be remembered—
if remembered at all—he is apt to be garrulous, more especially</p>
<p>“ When, musing on companions gone,<br />
He doubly feels that he’s alone.”</p>
<p>But I must tell my story in my own way if I tell it at all.</p>
<p>A warmer hearted man than Thomas Amyot, the secretary, friend, and biographer of Windham, never existed. Great was the encouragement and many the kindnesses which I received at his hands when I first began to dabble in literature. Fifty years ago, when I was proposing to edit the <em>Early Prose Romances</em>, he introduced me to that ripe scholar, Francis Douce, who received me with a warmth and cordiality which I could only attribute to his regard for Mr. Amyot. That warmth and cordiality never abated. The day when I entered the cell of Prospero—my older readers will remember that Mr. Douce was the Prospero of the Bibliomania, &amp;c.—that library which was dukedom large enough for the most voracious <em>helluo librorum</em> that ever breathed—was a happy day for me. He encouraged me in every way: lent me books—aye, and MSS. ; answered all my inquiries, poured out his stores of learning, encouraged my visits, and, only a few weeks before his death, told me that, when a young man, he, at Bindley’s special request, had regularly spent one evening every week with him at Somerset House, and urged me to do him what he was pleased to call the same kindness.</p>
<p>But more of dear old Francis Douce elsewhere and hereafter. I will only add that it was in his charming library at Gower Street that I first met, amongst others, James Heywood Markland and the accomplished author of <em>The Curiosities of Literature</em>, Isaac D’Israeli—two ripe scholars and good men whom it is at once a pride and a pleasure to have known.</p>
<p>But the greatest kindness I ever received from Mr. Amyot was about the year 1837, when one evening, at the Society of Antiquaries, he led me up to a gentleman, saying, “ You two should know each other, for I am sure you will be friends.” The gentleman put out his hand to me with that frank courtesy which was so characteristic of him ; and thus comntenced an acquaintance, which soon ripened intoamore than brotherly affection, between my ever-lamented friend John Bruce and myself.</p>
<p>What an advantage this intimacy with a man of such varied acquirements and such high intellectual and moral excellence was to me, perhaps I never fully appreciated until his sudden death in October, 1869, startled and shocked the large number of attached friends to whom his high character, talents, and kindliness had endeared him, and in whose memory he still holds a foremost place.</p>
<p>It was in one of our pleasant gossips on books and men, and while feeling the want of some information of which we were in search, and lamenting he difficulty of bringing such want under the notice of those who might be able to supply it, that the idea of starting a small paper with such special object was struck out. Once started, it was never lost sight of ; and about the year 1841 our plan had so far been matured that some specimen pages of <em>The Medium</em>, for so our projected journal was named, were set up in type by Mr. Richards, of St. Martin’s Lane, the printer for the Percy Society.</p>
<p>But <em>The Medium</em> was never destined to appear. The state of his wife’s health compelled Mr. Bruce to reside for some years in the country ; and for those years an incessant and confidential correspondence was my only compensation for the loss of those instructive interchanges of thought and talk which I had so much enjoyed.</p>
<p>But it may be asked why I could not as well undertake the sole management of the projected paper in 1841 as in 1849. I can only answer that the idea of taking upon myself the responsibility of conducting the proposed paper, except in conjunction with my accomplished friend, never once entered my head. The scheme had fallen to the ground, and but for an incident which I shall mention presently, I don’t believe “N. &amp; Q.” would ever have appeared.</p>
<p>3y the year 1849, when Rowland Hill’s great scheme of postal reform was beginning to bear fruit, the share which I had taken in the organization of some, and in the management of others, of many “co-operative literary societies” (Camden, Percy, Shakspeare, Elfric, Granger, &amp;c.) had so increased the number of my literary friends, that I felt I could venture to introduce to their notice a plan for turning those reforms to good account in the publication of works of interest to scholars, but not of a nature to remunerate publishers.</p>
<p>I need not fill space with an account of a scheme which was never carried out, but of which I may say that when I called upon John Mitchell Kemble, and we talked it over from “noon to dewy eve,” he spoke in such terms of approval as surprised me ; for, in his opinion, I was about to effect a revolution scarcely less important than that which had been brought about by the invention of printing; and, with his characteristic impulsive kindliness, he would not let me go away without a contribution to the first number in the shape of a transcript of a small portion of an old English Metrical Chronicle from a MS. at Göttingen. The great Saxonist was at that time editing the <em>British and Foreign Review</em>, and deeply interested in the war then raging in Hungary—a map of the scene of it was spread on his table, on which the position and movements of the different armies were marked by coloured pins.</p>
<p>John Mitchell Kemble was not only a man of deep and varied learning, but a man of great genius and of great eloquence. I remember once visiting him at Addlestone, and walking with him for two or three hours on Weybridge Common, while he poured out his learning on the ancient Mark, land boundaries, and land tenures, in a manner to make me regret that we had not a shorthand writer with us. He told me that he never wrote down any part of a book or essay he was going to publish until the whole was actually composed in his mind, and that the greater portion of his <em>Saxons in England</em> was actually completed in his head before a single line of it was committed to paper.</p>
<p>But enough for this week; for though, like honest Dogberry, I can find it in my heart to bestow all my tediousness upon my readers, I have just enough discretion left not to bestow it all at once.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF “NOTES AND QUERIES.”</p>
<p><em>(Continued from p. 2.)</em></p>
<p>The next man of letters whom I consulted was one whom I have frequently characterized, and I believe justly, as being as learned Selden and as witty as Sydney Smith, and whose kindness preceded, if possible, his learning and his wit — the Rev. Samuel Roffey Maitland, the author of <em>The Dark Ages</em>. He was not the librarian only, but the friend and trusted counsellor of good Archbishop Howley in perilous times. He never held a piece of church preferment in his life, but, from love of letters, gave up his own house and removed himself and his extensive library to a house in London, which cost him two hundred pounds a year, in order to act as librarian at Lambeth, with an annual salary of forty pounds. Honoured for ever be the memory of Dr. Maitland!</p>
<p>I spent a few hours with him at Gloucester, about a twelvemonth before his death. He was greatly altered, but his old kindliness and pleasant ways were as fresh as ever. He had a folio volume before him when I went to him in his library but my welcome was scarcely over before he from the side of it the last “N. &amp; Q,” and said “Here it is, I never miss reading it.”</p>
<p>If my readers knew the veneration in which Dr. Maitland’s name is held by those who had the good fortune to enjoy his friendship, they would pardon this digression.</p>
<p>But to return to my interview with him in 1849. I called upon him at Lambeth, told him what I had in contemplation, and he expressed his willingness to help me, but added, “I wish instead you would give us that paper you once proposed, in which we could all ask and answer one another’s questions.” But I had forsaken my first love, and think that in my many consulations with Mr. Bruce on the subiect of project, it ever occurred to either of revive <em>The Medium</em>; so for some time I remained loayl to the Cynthis of the minute, and met the eulogiums of my learned friend on the old scheme with renewed arguments in favour of one. But as the Maitland produced so many cogent of the original <em>sumpsinus</em>, as against new <em>mumpsinus</em>, that when I left Lambeth I was in a state of great doubt whether it would not be better, to speak after the manner of Tattersell, in the coming race for fame, to scrath the Postal Reform colt the and make the running with the <em>Medium</em>.</p>
<p>The more I weighed what Dr. Maitland had urged, the more I seemed impressed with it ; but would he who was, especially in all such matters, my guide, philosopher, and friend, Mr. Bruce, see it in the same light, and, if so, would it induce him to join with me in working out our old idea? He had returned to London, and was deeply engaged in those studies which enabled him to throw light upon our history from the time of Elizabeth to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>When I communicated to him my conversation with the learned Librarian of Lambeth, and recapitulated all he said in favour of the <em>Medium</em> and of its great utility to all men of letters, he admitted it as being identical with the view he had entertained when our project was first started. But on my asking him, such being his opinion, whether he felt disposed to renew our old scheme of endeavouring to establish such a periodical, he explained, with characteristic frankness, the reasons which prevented his then engaging in any such undertaking—reasons more creditable to his nice sense of honour than convincing to my judgment. But he added that, if I thought fir to establish such a journal on my own account, he would render every assistance in his power.</p>
<p>This heavy blow and great discouragement to me; and it was not till after many further consultations with him and other litereary friends that, acting on his judgment— I have no right to say in consequence of his advice—and after talking the matter over with others to whose opinions I attached great weight, I determined to take upon myself the risk and responsibility of starting “the little paper” in which literary men could ask answer one another’s questions.</p>
<p>While maturing my plans, it suddenly occurred to me that my projected weekly paper might be regarded in a light which I had never thought of, namely, as in opposition to <em>The Athenaeum</em>, and I determined to bring the matter at once fully and frankly before Mr. Dilke. In the year 1846, when the railroad mania was at its height, and the iron horse was trampling under foot all our ancient landmarks, and putting to flight all the relics of our early popular mythology, I had written to the editor of <em>The Athenaeum</em>, suggesting what good service he might render to students of popular antiquities by consenting to open his columns to notices of old-world manners, customs, and popular superstition, before they had been all swept away. I was invited to call at Wellington Street and talk the matter over. But, instead of the editor, I was received by Mr. Dilke. The result was his ready consent to do what I had asked, on condition that all communications on the subject should be sent on to me, and that I should select for publication such portions of them as in my judgment were worthy of preservation ; and the subject was brought forward in <em>The Athenaeum</em> of August 26, 1846, in an article by me which I headed “ Folk-Lore,” a word which has become household not only here, but abroad. This was my first interview with Mr. Dilke ; and if at that interview I was struck by his strong common sense, I was yet more impressed by his frankness and warm-hearted sympathy with my admiration of these old-world fancies. I afterwards communicated to the <em>Athenaeum</em> the series of papers on “Shakspeare’s Folk-Lore,” which is reprinted in my <em>Three Notelets on Shakspeare</em>.</p>
<p>When in 1849 I called on Mr. Dilke and told him what I had in contemplation, and said that, having eaten his salt, I was unwilling to repay his kindness with ingratitude, and expressed my readiness to give up my project if it could by possibility affect the <em>Athenaeum</em>, he spoke with his usual frankness and warm-hearted sympathy as he quieted my scruples, wished me every success, and promised any help he could give me.</p>
<p>How he did help with wise counsels few can have any idea. And here let me record one characteristic observation made by Mr. Dilke on the occasion to which I have been referring—a caution which I never lost sight of. He had expressed some doubts whether I might not find myself sometimes in a difficulty for want of materials. I met the
objection by saying that I had so many notes and memoranda I could fall back upon, I had no fears on that score. : But remember,” was the sensible and friendly reply, “ you may form a very correct judgment of what your correspondents write, but not be so good a judge of what you write yourself.”</p>
<p>How he enriched the pages of “N. &amp; Q.” by his contributions many of my readers know, and
all may see in the two recently published volumes entitled <em>Papers of a Critic,</em>* containing a series of articles reprinted from the <em>Athenaeum</em>, &amp;c., articles which, for minute criticism and careful patient investigation into obscure points of literary history and biography, may have been equalled, but assuredly have never been surpassed. And most certainly there is one thing known only to myself—the deep respect and affection with which I regarded that good and wise man—a respect and affection which it is my boast that he cordially returned.</p>
<p>William J. Thoms.</p>
<p><em>(To be continued.)</em></p>
<p>[It will not be out of place here to say that a correspondent writes to ask us if there is any hope of the readers of “N. &amp; Q.” having the benefit of perusing some of that “ incessant correspondence “ which Mr. Thoms refers to, in his interesting “ Story “ (ante, p. 2), as having been carried on for some years between himself and the late lamented John Bruce.]</p>

<p><em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1876-08-05: Vol 6 Iss 136 , 5th S. VI <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1876-08-05_6_136">p101-102</a>:</p>
<p>THE STORY OF “NOTES AND QUERIES.” <em>(Continued from p. 42.)</em></p>
<p>The month of September, 1849, was drawing to a close when I made up my mind to take upon myself the risk and responsibility of publishing a small journal devoted to the special use of literary inquirers and lovers of books, and announced my intention to those friends who I thought would be likely to avail themselves of its columns.</p>
<p>Though some few doubted whether my proposed undertaking would prove successful, they were, I think, unanimous in promising to support it, and nearly as unanimous in saying, “Of course, you will not think of bringing out your first number until January.” But I had determined differently, I argued with Macbeth (as sometimes quoted )—</p>
<p>“If it were well when it is done, then it were well
It were done quickly “ ;</p>
<p>and had made up my mind that the new journal should make its first appearance on the first Saturday in November. There were to my mind three good reasons for this. One was the fact that October, November, and December were months of comparative leisure with me, affording me more time to nurse my bantling. The second was that the literary year really commences in November, when the publishing season begins, the learned societies resume their meetings, the professional men are back at chambers, the old-booksellers at full work, and the <em>habitués</em> of the British Museum at their wonted seats in the Reading Room. The third was that it would probably be the only new claimant to public favour which would appear in November, whereas in January it might be only one of twenty competitors.</p>
<p>There wanted but five weeks to November, and there were as many important points to be settled before the paper could appear. What was to be its form ; what its price ; who was to print it ; who publish it; what was it to be called? Four of these were soon settled. Such of my readers as remember the <em>Somerset House Gazette</em>, published by Pine under the pseudonym of Ephraim Hardcastle, will recognize the prototype of the present paper. As I wanted a good circulation, I fixed upon a low price—threepence. I could not find better printers than Messrs. Spottiswoode with their excellent staff of readers, nor a worthier publisher than my friend Mr. George Bell, then of No. 186, Fleet Street. These four points were readily disposed of. Not so the fifth—what was the new journal to be called? Unlike one’s material offspring, which require to be born before they can be named, the offspring of the brain must be named before it is born, and a well-chosen name conduces materially to its safe and prosperous entrance into life ; and if a good name in man and woman be the very jewel of their souls, assuredly a well-chosen name is essential to the success of a new periodical. Who could believe that if our great, good-natured popular satirist had come forward as the <em>Londen Charivari</em> it would have taken public opinion by storm, as it did when it invited the listening world to give ear to the familiar voice of Punch? Who can doubt that the wisdom and far-sightedness of John Walter in abandoning its original title, the <em>Universal Register</em>, has contributed in no small degree to the world-wide influence and reputation which the Times now enjoys ?</p>
<p>As this was my opinion in 1849, it will readily be believed that the choice of a name for my new journal was a matter of much thought and consideration.</p>
<p>Some short time since, having occasion to refer to that most graceful piece of humour by Hookham Frere, <em>The Monks and the Giants</em>, the thought occurred to me how far the following passage may have suggested to Hood the title of one of the most popular cf his comic miscellanies :—</p>
<p>“ Poets consume exciseable commodities,<br />
They raise the nation’s spirit when victorious ;<br />
They drive an export trade in whims and oddities,<br />
Making our commerce and revenue glorious.”</p>
<p>It is scarcely probable that Hood had never enjoyed the wit and humour of <em>The Prospectus and Specimen of an intended National Work</em>, but I can well believe that the identity between this passage in Frere and the title of Hood’s <em>Whims End Oddities</em> is a mere coincidence. So with regard to the passage in the letter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth to Dr. Darwin, “ Here is a <em>note</em> and <em>query</em> for you,” quoted from the <em>Memoirs of R L Edgeworth</em> by Mr. Hooker, at p. 459 of the last volume; it is a coincidence, and a curious one, but nothing more. I never saw the book to my knowledge, and I can assure my friend Mr. Hooker I was not indebted to it in the slightest degree for the title which I eventually determined upon. If the reader has ever had the pleasure of perusing Dr. Maitland’s book on the Waldenses (and if he has not he will thank me for calling his attention to it), he will remember the doctor’s inquiries into the various explanations of the origin of the name of those victims of persecution, and how, after coming to the conclusion that they were so called after the founder of their views, Peter Waldo, he proceeds to inquire why he was so called, and eventually arrives at the very obvious conclusion, the relish of which I fear I may spoil in repeating it, that he was called Peter Waldo <em>because</em> his name was <em>Peter Waldo</em>! So was it with the name of this journal. All sorts of titles had suggested themselves to me and been suggested to me by my friends, and an entire evening had been occupied in passing them in review, when Mr. Bruce with his characteristic practical common sense said, “ But let us see what will be the chief objects of the paper ; what will it mainly consist of!” “ Notes al Queries “ was my answer, and we cudgelled our brains to find some title which should imply as much ; but in vain. On my homeward walk, however, the words “ Notes and Queries” continually recurred to me, and I wrote to Bruce the next morning to say that I had made up my mind, and that I should publish on Saturday, the 3rd of November, the first number of <em>Notes and Queries</em>. I think my choice was a happy one, but that opinion was not shared by all my friends. One for whom I had the deepest regard, and in whose judgment I had great reliance, protested strongly against it, and wrote to say that he thought the idea on which the paper was founded was so good that he was about to propose to join me in the undertaking, and bring in any capital that might be required, as well as his long experience in journalism, but that the title I had given it would be fatal to its success. But after giving his arguments my best attention, I stood fast by the title I had determined upon, and on the day appointed “ N. &amp; Q.” made its first appearance.</p>
<p>Of that first number I was and am very proud, and with good grounds. It opens with an address of which I may express my admiration, for it was written, not by the editor, but by Dr. Maitland, who had a few days previously communicated to me the happy suggestion, made by a learned lady relative, that Capt. Cuttle’s favourite maxim would be the fittest motto for “N. &amp; Q.”</p>
<p>This address is followed by an interesting note by Mr. Bruce “On the Place of Capture of the Duke of Monmouth,” and this by one of like character, “ Shakspeare and Deer Stealing,” by my esteemed old friend J. Payne Collier. “ Pray remember the Grotto,” by the editor, was followed by a notice of “A MS. Volume of Chronicles at Reigate,” from the pen of that kind and accomplished scholar, Albert Way. Mr. Dilke contributed two queries, brief yet characteristic— 1. As to the age of certain newspapers ; 2. with reference to a speech of Lord Chatham mentioned by Lord Brougham. Dr. Maitland contributed, in addition to the address already referred to, an article entitled “ Value of a Depository for Notes : New Edition of Herbert’s ‘Ames.’” “A Bibliophical Project,” by critical but kind-hearted
Bolton Corney, and “New Facts about Lady Arabella Stuart,” by poor Peter Cunningham, then the enfant <em>gâté</em> of every literary and social gathering, are the last of the signed articles.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that of those signed by initials or pseudonyms I now recognize only one—that on “Dorne the Bookseller,” signed W—, which was written by my learned friend the Rev. John Wil-son, who afterwards succeeded Dr. Bliss as Head of St. Mary Hall. There is one small query in the number to which accident gave an importance which I little anticipated when I inserted it. Some time in the preceding month I had met that distinguished and accomplished scholar, to whom I have been indebted for many kindnesses, M. Sylvain Van de Weyer, who after speaking in very warm terms of the excellent idea of “N. &amp; Q.,” and most hopefully of the prospect of its success, asked me to insert for him a query as to the origin and meaning of the phrase, “ A Flemish Account.” I did so, but instead of marking it with his initials, S. V. W., I commenced a practice which I have since frequently followed when making similar inquiries for other eminent persons, that of distinguishing the article by some initials which would remind me for whom it was inserted. In this case I identified The Belgian Minister by the initials “T. B. M.,” little thinking that by so doing I was misleading the world into the belief that amongst the earliest contributors to “ N. &amp; Q.” was the great popular historian, Thomas Babington Macaulay.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF “NOTES AND QUERIES.”
<em>(Continued from p. 102.)</em></p>
<p>If I had good reason to be proud of the contents of my first number, I had no such justification with regard to its sale ; for I do not believe more than forty copies were sold on the day of publication. At the end of a few weeks this forty was increased to six hundred ; but my satisfaction at this progress was considerably damped on hearing the opinion expressed by one of great experience in journalism, that I had probably reached the limits of circulation to which “N. &amp; Q.” was likely to attain. Happily my good friend’s foreboding was not realized ; the sale gradually but steadily increased, as did also the number of my correspondents.</p>
<p>I hope I may be pardoned if I enumerate some of those who gave the new journal early and valuable support.</p>
<p>My old friends Bruce, Payne Collier, Bolton Corney, and Peter Cunningham contributed to my second number articles of great and varied interest ; and Mr. Joseph Burtt, now one of the Assistant Keepers of the Public Records, and who was for some time the active and learned secretary of the Archeological Institute, contributed some valuable “ Notes on Ancient Libraries.”</p>
<p>My old and highly esteemed friend Edward Foss, the author of <em>The Lives of the Judges</em>—a
man as warm-hearted as he was shrewd and intelligent, and he was eminently both—invited information respecting Sir William Skipwith, King’s Justiciary in Ireland in the time of Edward III. Those who only knew Mr. Foss in his character as a lawyer, or as the author of that vast storehouse of legal history and biography with which his name is identified, in which he sacrificed everything to strict accuracy, and made no attempt to relieve the dryness of his subject by the introduction of irrelevant matter, can form little idea how great was his appreciation of humour, how much he possessed, how deeply music affected him, and how passionate was his enjoyment of Shakspeare and the Elizabethan dramatists. This was shown by his first literary effort, a small volume entitled <em>The Beauties of Massinger</em>, published about the year 1810.</p>
<p>This number contained also a letter from the Rev. C. F. Secretan, inquiring where he could consult a copy of the works of San Carlo Borromeo, there not being at that time a copy in the library of the British Museum. His object was, I believe, to see what light those writings might throw upon the history of Sunday Schools, of which Borromeo was the founder, long before Robert Raikes, of Gloucester, introduced them into this country. The Rev. Mr. Hooper, in the article which called forth these papers, spoke of Mr. Secretan, and most justly, as my “excellent son-in-law.” He was not so at that time ; and did not become so till nine years later; and nine years after that his most useful and exemplary life came to an end. I use the epithet “examplary” advisedly ; for as he was a most affectionate and devoted husband and father, so was he no less earnest and untiring in his character as a parish priest ; and on the day which saw him laid to his rest, in the quiet churchyard of Longdon, in Worcestershire, to the deep regret, not only of his new parishioners, but of many of his brother clergy, to whom he had endeared himself during his brief sojourn among them,—that same day one who had long known and esteemed him, the present Bishop of Lincoln, preached the funeral sermon of Charles Frederick Secretan in the church of Holy Trinity, Westminster, to a large congregation of those whom his zeal, piety, and eloquence had gathered under its roof during his twelve years’ charge of that newly formed district.</p>
<p>Among the writers in this number who signed their names with initials, I recognize those of two gentlemen whom I could not claim as personal friends, but knew from their high reputation as local antiquaries : I allude to Mr. Carthew, of East Dereham, and Mr. Brooke, of Ufford.</p>
<p>My third number opened with a quaint article on “ Travelling in England,” the history of which, from the Creation to the present time, the writer divided into “four periods, those of no coaches, few coaches, fast coaches, and railroads,” from some of the most learned pens that ever wrote in “N. &amp; Q.” I need scarcely name the writer. This pleasant paper was followed by one on “Sanuto’s Doges of Venice,” in the introduction te which the writer, that profound antiquary and accomplished paleographer, Sir Frederic Madden, Keeper of the MSS. in the British Museum, expressed his goodwill towards “N. &amp; Q.,” and his anxiety to promote its welfare; and this was no mere profession. For years I never hesitated to ask him for advice, or for any of that information with which his mind was overflowing, and always received from him the most courteous and cordial assistance ; and though on one occasion I was compelled, by what I believe to be an act of justice, to adopt a line of conduct which greatly displeased him, and which he resented, it did not alter my regard for him or my admiration of his learning. This was the only estrangement between any old friends and myself which, in the course of the two and twenty years which I managed this journal, that mamagement gave rise to. I was the better able to bear his coolness because I knew that what was not in a great degree the result of his state of health was owing to pressure put upon him ; and I felt sure that time would heal the wound. It did so; and, long before his lamented death, I had the satisfaction of knowing I had regained my old place in his personal regard.</p>
<p>My older readers will remember that “N. &amp; Q.” was the first journal which opened its columns to a record of photographic discovery and progress— a step which was not universally approved. Among my warmest supporters in this matter was Sir Frederic Madden.</p>
<p>My friend Dr. Diamond, whose characteristic it is to carry into any investigation, scientific or antiquarian, which he may be pursuing, as much antelligence as energy, had recognized the value of the Collodion process, and speedily contributed largely to its improvement. He was, I believe, the first to take a negative and print from it a positive copy of an old MS. I remember well his sending me two small specimens of photographic copies of early manuscripts; and I can never forget the delight and admiration expressed by Sir Frederic as he examined them, and saw every line, letter, and contraction copied with a truthfulness no human hand could approach, and learned that, the negative once accurately taken, copies of it might be produced in any number. It was only consistent with his love of truth in all things that the worthy Keeper of the MSS. should encourage the efforts of “N. &amp; Q.” to promote an art calculated to be of such service to archaeology in all its branches, and to prove a source of delight to thousands. I remember, soon after
“N. &amp; Q.” was started, the Rev. John Hunter, the learned historian of Hallamshire and commentator on Shakspeare, congratulating me on being entitled to the prize which Alexander the Great had offered for the discovery of a new pleasure ; and soon after the publication of full instructions for the successful practice of the art of photography in these columns, the good Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Vowler Short, paid me the same compliment nearly in the same words, adding that I was a public benefactor in publishing such a source of innocent and instructive amusement for the use of those who might have the good sense to avail themselves of it. Before leaving this subject, I must express my conviction that some of the simple processes discovered and published by Dr. Diamond in “N. &amp; Q.” have never been surpassed and rarely equalled ; and that my worthy friend’s services to the art have never yet been sufficiently recognized.</p>
<p>The Rev. Alfred Gatty, the editor of the new edition of Hunter’s <em>Hallamshire</em>, contributed to this number a series of interesting “ Letters from Lord Nelson’s brother, written immediately after the Battle of Trafalgar,” and the late learned librarian of the Chetham Library some valuable notes on “ Herbert’s Ames” ; while the number, which showed a decided increase in the list of contributors under initials and pseudonyms, was prefaced by a table of contents, which had been suggested by several correspondents, who had also urged the necessity of a good index. But I must postpone for the present what I have to say on the subject of our indexes.</p>

<p>The STORY OF “NOTES AND QUERIES”
(Cont S. vi. 222)</p>
<p>Every week added new and distinguished names to the list of avowed conributors, while others no less able preferred to identify their communications by pseudonyms or initials only. Thus, in the fourth number, appeared articles from the pens of Mr. Edward Hawkins, Mr. Singer, and the Rev. Mackenzie Walcott.</p>
<p>It was my privilege to be acquained fo many years with the learned, frank, outspoken, and straightforward Keeper of the Antiquities in the British Museum, who possessed a great variety of information on matters totally distinct from the department over which he presided with som much advantage. For instance, no man in England had so thorough an acquantance with the history of caricature in this country; and his collection of the works of our caricaturists was the most complete that had ever been formed. Many a pleasant morning have I passed in examining that collection; and it was my good fortune on one occasion to discover the point of a small satirical print in his possession, which had baffled the inquiries not only of Mr. Hawkins himself,  but of the late Mr. John Wilson Croker and Lord Holland. The print I allude to is that described in the Third Series of “N. &amp; Q.”, vol. ii. p. 401, and vol, x. p. 323. My success in this respect led him to challenge me to make further inquiries of a similar character, when baffled in licalhis endeavours to discover and make a note of the point of any caricature; for his collection was not only systematically catalogued, but carefully annotated, as all who had occasion to avail themselves of the liberality with which he placed his portfolios at the service of his literary friends will testify. Mr. Wright, in his <em>England Under the House of Hanover</em>, has paid a grateful tribute to Mr. Hawkins for the kindness with which he placed his large collections as his service.</p>
<p>Upon the death of Mr. Hawkins the Trustees of the British Museum became the purchasers of his caricatures, and I may here record an act of great liberality on the part of Mr. Hawkins’ representatives which deserves to be made known. ALl those who have paid any attention to this class of satirical works must have experienced the difficulty of arranging them in chronological order from the grossness and indecency by which many of them are disfigured, and are compelled, if they desire to make their collections complete, to keep separatley the most objectionable ones. Mr Hawkins adopted this very proper course; a spearate portfolio contained those caricatures which were most offensive, but many of which were among the most valuable (historically) in his collection. Some two or three years after it had been deposited in the Museum, I fancied I had found a clue to one of these objectionale caricatures relating to a distinguished personage and on my next visit to the British Museum visited Print Room for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not I was right. To my surprise the print was not to be found. Mr. Reid had never seen it, and it was not until he had referred to Mr. Hawkins’s MS. catalogue, and found it duly recorded there, that he was satisifed that I had seen it in Mr. Hawkins’s possession. Two or three other references to the catalogue for prints of a similar character soon established the fact that the portion of Mr. Hawkins’s collection to which they belonged had never reached the Museum. The fact was the portfolio containing them, having been kept separately from the rest, had been overlooked by the family, who, on being applied to, most handsomely handed it over to the Museum, although it had never been seen by the gentleman who valued the collection, and who must have added a considerable sum to the estimated value if it had been submitted to his inspection.</p>
<p>The name of Samuel Weller Singer had for some years ceased to figure in literary journals, until Mr. Singer was induced to emerge from his pleasant library at Mickleham, and give the world, in “N. &amp; Q.,” some of the fruits of his long literary leisure; for, as he told me some weeks afterwards, when I met him at the publisher’s, “N. &amp; Q.” had served to call him into a new literary existence. Mr. Singer’s <em>History of Playing Cards</em>, and many carefully superintended and annotated editions of our older poets, had long before established his reputation as a scholar and an antiquary. But a glance at the titles of some thirty or forty various articles contributed by Mr. Singer to the first and second volumes — including, as they do, papers on curious points of Anglo-Saxon and early Teutonic literature, on Spanish literature, on Ulrich von Hutten and the <em>Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</em>, on Early English writers, popular antiquities, and passages in Shakspeare that the writer’s learning was as accurate as it was varied, and proves how important an addition he was to the list of contributors. I had met him originally at Mr. Douce’s, but since the death of my old friend, whose fortune Mr. Singer inherited, I had never seen him, and it was a very agreeable surprise to me when I found I had been the means of securing to the public some of the results of his long and well-directed studies. I am inclined to believe that had it not been for the “N. &amp; Q.” the lovers of Shakspeare would never have seen Mr. Singer’s most valuabie edition of their favourite poet.</p>

<p>THE STORY “NOTES AND QUERIES.”</p>
<p><em>(Continued from S. vii. 2.)</em></p>
<p>When with the New Year I resumed the story of “N. &amp; Q.,” I was obliged, from the same cause which had interrupted it two or three months before, to avail myself of other eyes and another pen. I trust I may be pardoned for this purely personal allusion, but it necessary to explain a most extraordinary omission in my last paper—an omission of which I could not possibly have been guilty but for that circumstance. For Iif I myself had looked at p. 61 of that fourth number, the history of which I was there telling, a small Query, of less than five lines, modestly signed L.—, the initial of the surname of the writer— would have reminded me that that was the first of a long series of communications from one of the most candid, clear-headed, and accomplished scholars of the day, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, who from that 24th November, 1849, until the very Saturday which preceded his death—an event which Mr. Disraeli justly characterised as “a calamity which had befallen the nation”— continually enriched these columns with some of the fruits of his varied learning, and intelligent criticism. His last paper, to which I have just referred, viz. that on “The Presidency of Deliberative Aseemblies” (3rd S. iii 281), a most valuable artcile on an important subject, appeared only two days before his death— I must say friend, for he honoured me with many proofs of his respect and personal regard.</p>
<p>Few things connected with “N. &amp; Q.” have gratified me as much as its being the means of making me known to Sir G. C. Lewis, and the way it was brought about.</p>
<p>Calling one morning at the London Library on my old friend George Cochrane, then the librarian, and formerly editor of the <em>Foreign Quarterly review</em>, he exclaimed as soon as I entered his little sanctum, “Oh, I wish you had come ten minutes sooner! Cornewall Lewis has just been here, we have had a long talk about you and ‘N. &amp; Q.,’ and he wishes to know you.” I naturally expressed myself much flattered at this ; and yet more so when Cochrane continued, “What Cornewall Lewis says he means, and he left a message with me for you. He says you must often be passing the Home Office, and he hopes the very first time you do, you will call upon him”; and acting upon Cochrane’s advice, I called that very morning, was instantly received by that distinguished gentleman with a frankness and kindliness which were indescribably charming, and passed upwards of half an hour in most pleasant literary chit-chat; in the course of which he did not hesitate to point out, with all kindliness and courtesy, some of my shortcomings as an editor, and was, I think, somewhat surprised and amused when I told him that no one was so conscious of them as myself. Oh! I owe so much to Sir G. Cornewall Lewis. Honoured be his memory!</p>
<p>Mentioning dear old George Cochrane reminds me that I owe to him my introduction to another valued friend to whom the readers of “N. &amp; Q.” have been greatly indebted: not only for many valuable articles, but for a suggestion which has given great and general satisfaction, namely, that of publishing at stated intervals those General Indexes which, in words once used to me by Lord Brougham, “double the value and utility of ‘N. &amp; Q.’” I allude to Mr. William Bernard MacCabe, the learned author of that very original and curiously interesting book <em>The Catholic History of England</em>, and who may justly be described, in a line which I have seen applied to one of his most eminent co-religionists, as</p>
<p>“True to his faith, but not a slave of Rome.”</p>
<p>I am sorry I do not see his name in “N. &amp; Q.” so frequently as I used to do.</p>
<p>But I must get on, or my readers will anticipate that my story, like Carové’s more celebrated one, translated by Mrs. Austin, will prove to be <em>A Story without an End.</em> However I must run that risk, and here treating of thre contributors whose names first appeared in No. 5, bring, in another part, my old man’s gossip to an end with a few  similar notes on No. 6.</p>
<p>The first of the new names which appeared in this number is that of Mr. Planché, whose well earned reputation as one of the most graceful and  sparkling of dramatic writers is only rivalled by that which he has won for himself as a learned antiquary and an accomplished herald ; and who is now, as he has long been, the delight of society, which declares of him with great truth that age has not withered nor custom staled his infinite variety. Mr. Planche’s contribution was a very curious paper on “ Ancient Tapestry.”</p>
<p>The name of the venerable John Britton, who did so much good work in his day for English archaeology and architecture, also graced my fifth number, to which he contributed a note showing that the date of birth of John Aubrey was the 12th of March, 1625-6, and not the 3rd of November, as had been stated by a former correspondent, who had noted that the birthday of “N, &amp; Q.” was appropriately that of the Wiltshire antiquary.</p>
<p>It is my happy lot to be blessed with a contented disposition ; and I can sit down to a dinner of herbs without losing my equanimity, though I can relish and enjoy—no one more so a well-served, round-table dinner of half-a-dozen intelligent men, of each of whom, as of Chaucer’s Oxford Scholar, it ca be said “ Full gladly would he learn and gladly teach.” I look upon such a meeting as one of the highest intellectual enjoyments. It was at such a feast of reason, at which I was present, about thirty years since, and which I shall never forget, that I made the acquaintance of him of whom I am about to speak. My host was that model of official accuracy and great master of his own peculiar branch of knowledge- my late excellent friend, Sir Charles Young, Garter. It took place in his official residence in the Heralds’ College, and the party consisted of Garter himself, Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, the learned Deputy Keeper of the Public Records, my friend Bruce, a young friend of our host’s, and agentleman whom I then met for the first time. He was a Kentish clergyman, a ripe scholar, a profound antiquary, and a polished man of the world. On that night commenced an acquaintance between myself and the Rey. Lambert B. Larking (for he was the stranger in question), which soon grew into intimacy, and ripened into the warmest attachment, which ceased only with the death of one who seemed to win the affection of all with whom he came in contact. The affectionate regard in which he was held by his old friends and neighbours the late Earl of Abergavenny and his family, by Lord and Lady Falmouth, and by his friend the Marquess of Camden, who predeceased him only a few months, was shared by all the best people of his native county, to the history of which county he devoted every hour he could spare from his duties as a parish priest.</p>
<p>What his labours had accomplished and with what skill they had been carried out may be seen in the brief but touching memoir of my old friend which Sir Thomas D. Hardy contributed to the <em>Archeologia Cantiana</em>, which is only rivalled by the eloquent testimony borne to his high personal character and rare attainments by Mr. Bruce in the preface to Manningham’s <em>Diary</em>, printed for the Camden Society. Not until after his death did his admirable edition of <em>The Domesday of Kent</em> make its appearance, and show those who did not know Lambert B. Larking what a loss Kent had sustained in the founder of the Kent Archaeological Society. His contribution to my fifth number was connected with the MSS. of Sir Roger Twysden, and although he was not a very frequent correspondent, “N. &amp; Q.” benefited greatly by the instructive private letters which I continually received from him.</p>
<p>Mr. Larking died on Sunday, the 2nd of August, 1868, and the reader will readily imagine the pain with which I heard of his death when I say that not being aware of his illness, Mr. Bruce and myself had arranged to give him an agreeable surprise by running down to Ryarsh on the Saturday and having a gossip and luncheon with him, and returning home together. Happily an accident prevented our intrusion at such a sad moment ; and we learned in a day or two that this good man and great scholar had sunk to his rest.</p>

<p><em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1877-04-21: Vol 7 Iss 173, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1877-04-21_7_173/page/n1/mode/2up">p303-305</a>:</p>
<p>The Story of “Notes and Queries”</p>
<p>*(Concluded from p. 223)</p>
<p>My sixth number opened with an interesting account of “Monmouth’s Ash”, forwarded with charactersitic kindness by the late Earl of Shaftesbury, in reply to the inquiry for information on the subject made by Mr. Bruce in the opening number.</p>
<p>But “dear old Lord Shaftesbury,” as he is still affectionately called by those who had the good fortune to serve under him, was not the first peer who contributed to “N. &amp; Q.,” althugh he was the first whose name appeared in its columns.</p>
<p>The first Noble Author — to speak after the fashion of Horace Walpole— who wrote in these columns, uniformly signed his communications with his initials only, P. C. S. S.; and the first of these was a curious note on Southey’s “Doctor Dove of Doncaster and his horse Nobbs,” which called forth one or two notes equally curious.</p>
<p>P. C. S. S. was my most kind and accomplished friend (I trust I may be permitted to call him so) Percy Clinton Sydney-Smythe, Viscount Strangford. Most of my readers will remember that his translation of Camoens earned him a place in the <em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em>; few of them perhaps that Byron’s <em>Hours of Idleness</em> contained “Stanzas to a Lady, with the Poems of Camoens,” and that, as we learn from a note in the recent editions of Byron, “Lord Strangford’s translation of Cameons’ Amatory Verses was, with Little’s Poems, a favourite study of Lord Byron’s at the period.”</p>
<p>Lord Strangford, who was Dublin Gold Medallist in 1800, was a ripe and good scholar; and in the course of his long career as a diplomatist had seen and heard so much that was noteworthy, that is it little wonder if his conversation was always full of interest and illustrated by capital anecdotes. Many and many such has it been my good fortune to hear from him in the course of the pleasant familiar chats whith which he honoured me, sometimes the subject originating in a “proof” of an article for the forthcoming number of the <em>Quarterly</em>. One of his anecdotes, as showing what trifling incidents may bring about a change of fashion and taste in a whole nation, is so germaine to the objects of “N. &amp; Q.” that I must, on some more fitting occasion, ask the editor to find room for it.</p>
<p>But from Dec. 1, 1849, to May 26, 1855, Lord Strangfrod was a more or less frequent contributor. Three days after the appearance of his last communication Lord Strangford was no more. His death was at once a shock and a surpirse to me; for though I knew he was too unwell to be present at the great debate on Lord Grey’s motion, on the 25th, repsecting the Russian War— for I had had a letter from him on the subject— I little anticipated that I was to see him no more. A phrase which has been repeated over and over again during the recent discussion on the Eastern Question has continually called Lord Strangford to my rememberance, with reference to a conversation which I had with him on the state of affairs— a conversation which showed how little the most experienced of statesmen or diplomatists (for it must be remembered that Lord Strangford had been our Ambassador both at Constantinople and St. Petersburg) can forecast coming events. “Well, my lord,” said I, one day, “is it to be peace or war?” “Mr. Thoms, I have had a long talk with Heytesbury this morning; and we will undertake to keep the piece of England for <em>sixpence</em>. ALl that is wanted is to build a bridge for Russia to retire over.” Lord Heytesbury, it wil be remembered, had played as important a part as a diplomatist as Lord Strangford, and, like him, had ben Ambassador at the Court of St, Petersburg.</p>
<p>But Lord Strangford’s communications were not the only good service which he rendered to “N. &amp; Q.” and to myself,. It was owing to his introduction that this same number contained the first of a long series of most interesting Notes, Queries, and Replies from one of his oldest and most intimate friends; one who, like the noble lord, having won laurels at Trinity College, Dublin, added to them the highest reputation as a statesman and politician. The modest C. by which all these articles were signed told to very few that the author of them was the Right Hon. John Wilson Croker.</p>
<p>Mr Croker’s communications to “N. &amp; Q.” might be numbered by hundreds. I must quote from one of them in “N. &amp; Q.” of July 7 ,1855, in which he bears the following tribute to the “most accomplished and able nobleman” of whom I have been speaking:—</p>
<p>“One who has known him for fifty-eight years has a melancholy pleasure in bearing — *valeat quantum” — his testimony to the extent and variety of his information— the liveliness of his fancy— the goodness of his heart— and the private and public integrity of his long and distinguished life.”</p>
<p>Mr. Croker is not the only kind and warm hearted man whom it would be unjust to judge from the severity of his criticisms, and whose nature seemed to alter, the moment he took pen in hand as a public writer. His private letters, of which I have many, are admirable, kindly, full of information, and very suggestive; and in the few interviews which it was my good fortune to have with him, his conversation rivalled in interest and anecdote that of his old friend of fifty-eight years standing.</p>
<p>At the last of these interviews, when I had called on him at Kensington Palace to answer, or rather to talk over with him, a literary question on which he had written to me, he was particularly cheerful and chatty; and on that occasion told me several interesting anecdotes of the Great Duke and other celebrities. The readers of the article on Mr. Croker in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> of July last will remember that Mr. Croker, in his diary, under the date Sept. 4, 1852 recording the particulars of a visit paid to him at Folkestone by the Duke, says:—</p>
<p>“Lady Barrow’s five little girls were with us, and he won their hearts by writing his name in their albums; in the signature of one, the best written of the five, he wrote his name with a single <em>l</em>. His good humour and kindness to the children, indeed to everybody, was remarkable.”</p>
<p>As Mr Croker told me the story, it was this very good nature that led to the misspelling. When he wrote his name in the album of the yougest of the little girls he, with characteristic thoughtfulness, wrote it in a large text hand. This no doubt led to the error. The youn g lady discovered the mistake, and said, “Why, you don’t know how to spell your own name.” The Duke looked at it and laughed, and said, “My dear, you take care of that signatue, for it is the only time in my life I ever made such a mistake. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[This</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">mistake</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Duke's.</span> <span class="pre">He</span> <span class="pre">had</span> <span class="pre">previously</span> <span class="pre">written</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">vistor's</span> <span class="pre">book</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">Eton</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">&quot;Welington.&quot;</span> <span class="pre">We</span> <span class="pre">remember</span> <span class="pre">directing</span> <span class="pre">Mr</span> <span class="pre">Thoms's</span> <span class="pre">attention</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">autograph</span> <span class="pre">when</span> <span class="pre">he</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">other</span> <span class="pre">joyous</span> <span class="pre">members</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Cocked</span> <span class="pre">Hat</span> <span class="pre">Club</span> <span class="pre">(all</span> <span class="pre">F.S.A.'s)</span> <span class="pre">went</span> <span class="pre">over</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Eton</span> <span class="pre">College</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">few</span> <span class="pre">years</span> <span class="pre">ago.]</span></code></p>
<p>The last communciation from Mr. Croker, a query respecting Pope and Gay, appeared in “N. &amp; Q.” of August 1, 1857. On the morning of Monday, the 10th, the post brought me an interesting letter from him in connexion with his proposed edition of Pope; and before that day had closed the long, useful, and distinguished career of Mr. Croker came to an end. He had ceased from his labours and was at rest.</p>
<p>Strangley enough, the only other new name in my sixth number was that of another distinguished scion of Trinity College, Dublin, the Rev. James Henthorn Todd, at that time, I believe, Senior Fellow and Regius Professor of Hebrew. He was a great friend and literesy ally of Dr. Maitland, and there was much similarity between them, alike in the depth of their scholarship and their keen sense of the witty and humourous. I made Dr. Todd’s acquaintance at the meetin gof the Archaological Institute at Winchester, when it was my good fortune to make the fourth in the carriage which conveyed Drs.

It was a day to be remembered; and how vividly does the jotting down of this trifling incident recall to my mind those pleasant anniversaries of the Society of Antiquaries on St. George’s Day, when Lord Aberdeen presided over our dinner at the Freemasons’ Tavern, and after dinner a Fellow, far from the least learned and accomplished of those present, used to charm us all by singing the good old song “St. George he was for England.” Though after some time Dr. Todd’s communications gradually grew less frequent — probably as he became more engaged by his various duties in connexion with his college, the Irish Archaeological Society, and the Royal Irish Academy, of which he was at one time President — he never ceased to write in these columns until, on June 27, 1869, death, deprived Ireland of one of her ripest scholars and most distinguished Churchmen in James Henthorn Todd, whose loss was mourned equally on both sides the channel.</p>
<p>And now, <em>manum de tabulâ</em>. I commenced this long stroy with an allusion to honset Dogberry’s assurance to Leonato as to his “tediousness”; and appeal to my readers whether I have not outdobne Dogberry, and bestowed upon them what the worthy constable only promised.</p>

<p>In <em>Notes and Queries</em>, 1885-08-22: Vol 12 Iss 295, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1885-08-22_12_295">p141</a>.</p>
<p>W. J. THOMS.</p>
<p>On Saturday last, at a few minutes before midght, Mr. William John Thoms expired at his house, St. George’s Square, Belgrave Road. Mr. Thoms, who was born on November 16, 1803, and as consequently in his eighty-second year, had outlived most of his contemporaries. Of the brilliant gathering which assembled at Willis’s Rooms n November 1, 1872, to do him honour on his signing the editorship of “ N. &amp; Q.” few are left. Lord Stanhope, the chairman, Lord Lyttelton, the vice-chairman, Lord Houghton, Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, Sir M. Digby Wyatt, and a host of others, including Mr. Thoms’s two successors in the editorial chair, have passed away. A few only of those who thirty-six years ago assisted Mr. Thoms in establishing “ N. &amp; Q.” survive to hear of his departure, with that modified sense of loss which tends the exit of one whose race has long been run and whose honours and rewards came to him in days now remote. Since his resignation in 1882 of active service, Mr. Thoms’s interest in life has languished. He has during the last few years gone little into the world, and the hope occasionally expressed by his friends that he would live personally to confute his well-known theories with regard to longevity has been playful rather than sanguine.</p>
<p>The connexion of Mr. Thoms with “N. &amp; Q.” is now historic. He has himself, in vols. vi. and vii. of the Fifth Series, left on record the circumstances under which this periodical was conceived, named, and started.</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms was a son of the late N. Thoms, secretary of the first Commission of Revenue Inquiry, was born in Westminster, and began active life as a clerk in the secretary’s office, Chelsea Hospital. He was elected in 1838 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the same year he became Secretary of the Camden Society, a post he held until 1873. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Edinburgh and Copenhagen, and Secretary of the AElfric Society. An incomplete list of his various contributions to literature is given in <em>Men of the Time</em>. At 4th S. x. 241 appears his farewell note on resigning his connexion with “ N. &amp; Q.” During many years Mr. Thoms held an appointment in the House of Lords. In 1863 he was appointed to the deputy librarianship of the House of Lords, a post he resigned in consequence of old age in 1882.</p>
<p>A sound and an accurate scholar, the close ally during more than half a century of the best English and foreign scholars, Mr. Thoms had in an eminent degree the serviceable gift of knowing where information was to be found. This quality, invaluable in a librarian as well as in an editor, rendered him especially serviceable to the members of the House of Lords, with many of whom he was on terms of close and honourable intimacy. His genial fancy and humour and his social gifts rendered him a favourite in all companies, while such were his good nature, his kind-heartedness and tact, that he was mixed up in no archieological feud or quarrel, and preserved through his life a record of intimacies and friendships unbroken and undiversified by a single quarrel. Mr. Thoms was before all things a student. The stores of his admirably furnished mind were at the service of any one engaged in earnest work; but he was retiring in nature, little given to promiscuous hospitality, and little addicted to the life of clubs. Few figures were less familiar than his at the Atheneum Club, of which during many years he was a member. In religion a moderate High Churchman, and in politics a strong Conservative, he held aloof from polemics, and he frequently, under a sense of official responsibility, abstained from voting when a Government opposed to his sympathies was in power. Mr. Thoms slept in the midst of his books, with which, indeed, his house was crammed. His library, which is miscellaneous in character, is eminently rich in books relating to the Junius controversy, in which, as is known, he took a keen interest. Among the proofs of his happiness in hitting on names may be cited his choice of <em>Notes and Queries</em>, his invention of the word <em>folk-lore</em>, and his application to the churchyard of the term, taken from the German and immediately seized upon by the public, God’s acre. Contributors to “ N. &amp; Q.” might add greatly to reminiscences which, unfortunately, have little that is personal. This periodical may, perhaps, take rank as the best outcome of Mr. Thoms’s mind. It is, at least, likely to keep his memory in survival.</p>

<h2>Looking back, 1899<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-back-1899" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As <em>Notes and Queries</em> reached its 100th volume, the time was ripe for a retrospective look back at the history of the publication to date, including some of the highlights from the earliest issues.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Special editorial, Jubilee 100th volume, 1899</p>
<p>Notes and Queries, 1899-11-04: Vol 4 Iss 97, Jubilee 100th volume with special editorial, <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/sim_notes-and-queries_1899-11-04_4_97/page/n3/mode/2up">p363—</a></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It is in this eventful year we celebrate the jubilee of, to speak of it in the terms of its founder, “dear old Notes and Queries,” the first number of which was published on the 3rd of November, 1849. In the summer of 1846 Mr. William John Thoms, the founder and first editor of Motes and Queries, wrote to The Atheneum, suggesting that it would be both useful and ineresting if it would open its columns to correspondence on the manners, customs, observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, &amp;c., of the olden time. Mr. Dilke was so much struck with the idea that he invited Mr. Thoms to call upon him at the office in Wellington Street, a with certain limitations, the plan was agreed to, and on the 22nd of August the first article appeared, Mr. Thoms writing under the pseudonym of “ Ambrose Merton,” and giving to his investigations the title of “ Folk-Lore.” In the number published on the 4th of September, 1847, Mr. Thoms revealed himself to be “Ambrose Merton,” and at the same time claimed the honour of introducing the expression “ Folk-Lore,” as Isaac Disraeli does of introducing ‘Fatherland’ into the literature of the country. The Atheneum of the same date states “that in less than twelve months the word ‘Folk-Lore’ has almost attained to the dignity of a household word.” Mr. Thoms at this time commenced a series of nine articles on the Folk-Lore of Shakespeare, little realizing that this special subject was to assume such dimensions. In 1849 it was found that the Folk-Lore articles and correspondence had become so extensive that it was impossible, having regard to the increasing demands that literature, the fine arts, and the other subjects treated in The Atheneum made on its space, that they should be continued. Mr. Thoms, therefore, felt that the time had come when a journal entirely devoted to the subjects in question might be started with a fair chance of success. The title of Notes and Queries, “after much cudgelling of brains,” was hit upon, and with a hearty greeting from The Atheneum the new paper started on its way.</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms, in his interesting reminiscences of the founding of the journal, gives a record of the first six numbers, and renders, with true old-world courtesy, full tribute to those whose contributions had been so largely helpful to its success (5 S., vi. 1, 41, 101, 221; vii. 1, 222, 303). He also says that the title of Notes and (Queries was not considered by many of his friends to be a good one, but that he himself, being so well pleased with it, determined to stand fast by it. Mr. Peter Cunningham suggested for its motto the words of Cowper :—</p>
<p>By thee I might correct, erroneous oft,<br />
The clock of History—facts and events<br />
Timing more punctual, unrecorded facts<br />
Recovering, and mis-stated setting right.</p>
<p>But it was due to the happy suggestion of a lady that Captain Cuttle’s favourite maxim brcame the motto of the new venture. The first number opened with an address by Dr. Maitland. This was followed by a note by John Bruce, ‘On the Place of Capture of the Duke of Monmouth’; then ‘Shakespeare and Deer Stealing,’ by John Payne Collier; and ‘Pray remember the Grotto,’ by the Editor. Mr. Dilke and Mr. Albert Way also contributed, and Peter Cunningham gave some ‘New Facts about Lady Arabella Stuart.’ Strange to say, notwithstanding the variety and interesting character of the paper, only forty copies were sold on the day of publication. In the course of the next few weeks this forty was increased to six hundred, after which the sale gradually but steadily became larger, several of the first issues having to be re printed. In these early numbers it is curious to note the phraseology of fifty years ago, the complimentary term for contributors being “respectable”, while the title of esquire was then so limited that we actually find Mr. Murray in his advertisements adding “Esquire” to the names of most of his authors.</p>
<p>The third number contains some original letters addressed by Lord Nelson’s brother to the Rev. A. J. Scott in reference to the arrangements for the removal of the body of the fallen hero from the Victory to Greenwich Hospital. The letters are signed “ Nelson,” and a postscript to one of them is as follows:</p>
<p>“It will be of great importance that I am in possession of his <em>lasf will</em> and <em>codicils</em> as soon as possible — no one can say that it does not contain, among other things, many directions relative to his funeral.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Alfred Gatty, who had_ kindly placed these letters at Mr. Thoms’s disposal, adds:</p>
<p>“The <em>codicil</em> referred to in these letters proved to be, or at least to include, that memorable document which the Earl suppressed, when he produced the will, lest it should curtail his own share of the amount of favour which a grateful country would be anxious to heap on the re presentatives of the departed hero. By this un worthy conduct the fortunes of Lady Hamilton and her still surviving daughter were at once blighted.”</p>
<p>In the fourth number appears a query from Sir George Cornewall Lewis, who continued to be a constant contributor, his last paper appearing only two days before his death, which took place on the 13th of April, 1863. To enumerate all the chief contributors would be to give almost every known name in literature. Many, like Mr. Dilke, chose to remain anonymous, but among those whose names appear in the early numbers may be mentioned …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The first volume of <em>Notes and Queries</em> was completed with the thirtieth number, May 25th, 1850, the second volume running from the 1st of June to the end of the year, after which the volumes were issued each half year, the First Series being completed on the 22nd of December, 1855.</p>
<p>By the close of the first twelve months Mr. Thoms had the delight of knowing that the objects he had in view in starting his vaper had been, to a large extent, fulfilled ; he had laid down his “literary railway,” and it had been “ especially patronised by first-class passengers,” his aim being, as he tells us in his introduction to the fifty-second number,</p>
<p>“to reach the learning which lies scattered not only throughout every part of our own country, but all over the literary world, and to bring it all to bear upon the pursuits of the scholar; to enable, in short, men of letters all over the world to give a helping hand to one another.”</p>
<p>And this end had, to a certain extent, been accomplished, “Our last number,” continues Mr. Thoms,</p>
<p>“contains communications not only from all parts of the metropolis, and from almost every county in England, but also from Scotland, Ireland, Holland, and even from Demerara.”</p>
<p>A further note of congratulation is added in “Our Hundredth Number,” when Mr. Thoms claims “the privilege of age to be garrulous.” He states that “during the hundred weeks our paper has existed we have received from Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France — from the United States — from India—from Australia —from the West Indies— from almost every one of our Colonies letters expressive of the pleasure which the writers many of them obviously scholars ‘ripe and good,’ though far removed from the busy world of letters), derive from the perusal of ‘ Notes and Queries.’ “</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms adds : “ How many a pertinent Note, suggestive Query, and apt Reply have reached us from the same remote quarters !” Reference is also made to the good service rendered to men of letters here at home, as well as to a goodly list of works of learning and research, such as Cunningham’s ‘ Hand book of London Past and Present,’ “ published when we had been but a few months in existence, down to Wycliffe’s ‘ Three Treatises on the Church,’ recently edited by the Rev. Dr. Todd.”</p>
<p>Many suggestions have been made by contributors from time to time with a view to increasing the usefulness of Votes and (Queries. Among these was one made by Mr. F. A. Carrington on the 15th of November, 1856, that “‘N. &amp; Q.’ would have great additional value if the contributors of Notes (Queries do not signify) would give their names.” This elicited from “C.” on the 6th of December a reply against the proposal :</p>
<p>“Those who please may, and many do sign, and others who give no name are as well known as if they did; but, as a general rule the absence of the name is, I am satisfied, best. It tends to brevity it obviates personalities—it allows a freer intercommunication of opinion and criticism.”</p>
<p>Then “C.” closes with a prediction that must have set the editor all of a tremble: “If we were all to give our names ‘N. &amp; Q.’ would, in three weeks, be a cock-pit.”
…
In the indexes to the eighth and ninth volumes the plan was adopted of denoting unanswered queries with an asterisk, but the increasing number of queries rendered the labour of such a record too great. The indexes to the first three series were the work of Mr. James Yeowell, and the plan and methods originated by him have been carefully preserved in the succeeding issues. Of his services to the publication I shall again make mention.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>On August 13th, 1864, Mr. Thoms thus records the death of his friend Charles Wentworth Dilke :—</p>
<p>“In the death of Charles Wentworth Dilke ‘N. &amp; Q.’ has sustained a great loss; for, among the many able writers who have from time to time contributed to its pages, no one has enriched them with so many valuable papers illustrative of Eng- lish History and Literature as he whose death it is now our painful duty to record. Mr. Dilke was one of the truest-hearted men, and kindest friends, it has ever been our good fortune to know. He died on Wednesday last, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. The distinguishing feature of his character was, his singular love of truth; and his sense of its value and importance, even in the minutest points and questions of literary history. In all his writings the enforcement of this great principle, as the only foundation of literary honour and respectability, was his undeviating aim and object. What the independence of English Literary Journalism owes to his spirited exertions, clear judgment, and unflinching honesty of purpose, will, we trust, be told hereafter by an abler pen than that which now announces his deeply lamented death.”</p>
<p>On the 10th of July, 1875, Mr. Thoms reviews “The Papers of a Critic, selected from the Writings of the late Charles Wentworth Dilke, with a Biographical Sketch by his Grandson, Sir hase V. Dilke, Bart., M.P.,” 2 vols. (Murray). Mr. Thoms in his review states that there was no more successful clearer-up of vexed questions in social, litical, or literary history than the late Mr. Dilke,</p>
<p>“for the simple reason that he brought to the work persistent industry, earnestness, and an honest spirit of truthfulness ; and he delivered no judgment till he was thoroughly satisfied that it was correct on every point, and in no part assailable. But the readers and comtalbehuneel ‘N. &amp; Q.’ do not require to be told of the rare qualities which distinguished Mr. Dilke as a critic. They will be glad to possess the papers which his grandson has collected, and which prove that he stood unrivalled as a master of the art of criticism. honour of possessing his friendship have a loving and undying memory of what Mr. Dilke was as a man. heartily recommend a perusal of the memoir, in which his grandson tells the story of a thoroughly honest man’s honest and useful life.”</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms then letter from Mr. Dilke to his son, of which he says :—</p>
<p>“ The columns of ‘N. &amp; Q.’ have contained many beautiful letters written by men who now, as the phrase is, ‘belong to history’; but we question if there is one among them all which is so tender and wise.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dilke’s contributions to <em>Notes and Queries</em> were very large, but as in its pages had, as he said, “as many aliases as an Old Bailey prisoner,” it is difficult to trace some of them. In ‘ Papers of a Critic’ we are helped to a solution. “He nearly always used the initials of the first three words of the heading of his contributions. Suppose, for instance, it was ‘The Carvlls of Ladyholt,’ it would be signed T.C.O.  …</p>
<p>In the memoir which appears of Mr. Dilke in the ‘ Dictionary of National Biography’ it is stated that “the best comments on his character and his literary work were those of his old friend Thoms in <em>Notes and Queries</em>; and both having been intimately associated with the founding of <em>Notes and QUeries</em>, I have felt what a pleasure it would be to its readers to have the portraits of the two friends omer side by side in this our Jubilee number, and I am certain that such would have been the desire of its founder. I much wished to have given a portrait of Mr. Dilke taken only four years before his death, but, unfortunately, I have to lament, like Mr. Thoms, the faded photographs of old friends.</p>
<p>I will only add just this testimony from myself. No words can express the affection land regard that my father and all of us in our home in Wellington Street had for him.</p>
<p>The number for the 28th of September, 1872, opens with ‘A Parting Note’ from Mr. Thoms :</p>
<p>“There is something very solemn in performing any action under the consciousness that it is for the last time.</p>
<p>“ Influenced by this feeling it had been my intention that this the last number of <em>Notes and Queries</em> edited by me should not have contained any intimation that the time had arrived, when I felt called upon to husband my strength and faculties for those official duties which form the proper business of my life.</p>
<p>“ But the fact having been widely announced, I owe it to myself, and to my sense of what is due to that large body of friends, known and unknown, by whom I have been for three-and-twenty years so ably and generously seconded, to tender them my public and grateful acknowledgements for their long-continued kindnesses.</p>
<p>“’ With conscious pride I view the band<br />
Of faithful friends that round me stand ;<br />
With pride exult that I alone<br />
Have joined these scattered gems in one ;<br />
Rejoiced to be the silken line<br />
On which these pearls united shine.’</p>
<p>“This pride is surely a most see one ; and he who could separate himself from the pleasant associations which I have thus enjoyed for nearly a quarter of a century, without deep pain and emotion, must be made of sterner materials than I can boast.</p>
<p>“ That pain would be yet greater, that emotion yet more deep, did I not feel assured that in resigning my ‘plumed’ sceptre into the hands of Dr. Doran, I entrust it to one who not only desires to maintain aneneners the general character of this Journal, but will, by his intelligence, courtesy, and good feeling, secure for dear old <em>Notes and Queries</em> the continued allegiance of those kind and intelligent friends who have made it what it is.</p>
<p>“To those friends, one and all, I now with the deepest gratitude, and most earnest wishes for their welfare and happiness, tender a hearty and affe« tionate FAREWELL, William J. Thoms.</p>
<p>“In publicly acknowledging how great are my obligations to my accomplished friend Mr. James Yeowell, for his valued and long-continued assistance, I am doing a simple act of justice which it affords me the highest gratification to perform.”</p>
<p>The editorship of Dr. Doran commenced on the 5th of October, and <em>Notes and Queries</em> having been purchased by Sir Charles W. Dilke, its publication was removed to 20, Wellington Street, the oftice of <em>The Athenaeum</em>, and my father became its publisher. For the first fourteen years it was published by Mr. George Bell, of Bell &amp; Daldy, now the well-known firm of George Bell &amp; Sons. Mr. Bell took great interest in its progress, and regretted much having to sever his connexion with it; but with the increase of his own business, and the fact that <em>Notes and Queries</em> now required an ottice of its own, it was not yossible to combine the two. When Mr.Thoms decided upon the change he consulted with my father, who took in hand all the business details until <em>Notes and Queries</em> was safe in its new home.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Mr. James Yeowell, who had been the active sub-editor for more than twenty years, died on Friday, the 10th of December, 1875, and the number for the 18th opens with a beautiful tribute to his memory by Mr. Thoms, who said of him that he was “one who had many friends, but never an enemy.” <em>The Athenaeum</em>, in its obituary notice of the same date, states of this “ simple-minded worshipper of strict accuracy” that “no man was ever more fortunate in finding in his daily occupation the labour in which he delighted,” and suggests that his large collection of cuttings, jottings, and notes illustrative of the biography of the “illustrious obscure” of our literature should be secured by the British Museum.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms again appears before the readers of <em>Notes and Queries</em> in the preface to the index to the Fifth Series, as well as in the first number of the Sixth, in which, with an old man’s privilege, he makes sorrowful reference to those contributors who had passed away since he had called the journal into existence some thirty years before :</p>
<p>“ Many of these were dear personal friends, ‘not of the roll of common men.’ Peace to their to honoured memories !</p>
<p>“ Happily for the cause of good earnest inquiry after literary and historical truth, their places have been supplied by worthy successors, as a glance at the contents of this the opening number of our Sixth Series will abundantly testify. It is a number to which the editor may point in every way with justifiable pride, as an evidence of the high esteem in which ‘N &amp; Q.’ is held by men of eminence in literature and position.</p>
<p>“Long may my offspring occupy the position which it so worthily fills; and long may the contributors to dear old ‘ N. &amp; Q.’ greet each new series as I do this, <em>Floreat ! Floreat ! Floreat !</em>”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Saturday the 15th of August, 1885, was a day of deep mourning for <em>Notes and Queries</em>. The kind-hearted, genial scholar, its founder and first editor, was dead. The obituary notice, written by Mr. Knight, which appeared the following week, renders full tribute to his sound learning, his genial fancy and humour, as well as to his social gifts, which caused him to be a favourite in all companies, while his good nature and tact saved him from being mixed up in archeological feuds, and preserved to him throughout his life a record of intimacies and friendships unbroken by a single quarrel.</p>
<p>Although the daily papers at the time, as well as <em>The Atheneum</em>, gave obituary notices and the ‘Dictionary of National Biography ‘ contains particulars of his life written by Mr. E. Irving Carlyle (how proud he would have been at the constant reference made to ‘N. &amp; Q.’ in its pages!), I have felt that we should have some record to refer to in his own journal.</p>
<p>Mr. William John Thoms was born on the 16th of November, 1803, so that he was the junior of his friend Mr. Dilke by fourteen years. He was the son of Nathaniel Thoms, who had been for many years a clerk in the Treasury. Mr. T. C. Noble, in ‘N. &amp; Q’ of the 17th of October, 1885, records that a curious error was made in the register of his baptism in St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster, December 15th, 1803, in which his name is given as simply “John Thoms, son of Nathaniel by Ruth Ann, [born] November 16.” This was corrected in 1857 by a sworn atftidavit before Mr. Arnold, the magistrate, and at the foot of the page was then written, “This should be William John Thoms, accord ing to the declaration of Mary Ann Thoms annexed hereto Mercer Davies, curate, June 5, 1857.” Mr. Thoms was for twenty years in the Secretary’s Office at Chelsea Hospital, and in 1845, on account of the great railway pressure, additional clerks being required for the service of the House of Lords, Mr. Thoms was appointed to a clerkship, and was for many years head of the Printed Paper Office, where, The Athenaeum says, his literary knowledge and research soon became known, and it was not long before he</p>
<p>“had drawn to his room for unofficial purposes the great lawyers and politicians of the recent past, Lord Brougham, Lord Lyndhurst, and Lord Campbell; the eminent historians Lord Macaulay and Earl Stanhope; and to these may be added the names of the Earl of Ellenborough, Lord Broughton but a complete list would include most of the distinguished names among the members of the Upper House.”</p>
<p>As early as 1838 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in the work of which he took an active part, and did his best to prevent the election for membership of those who, with only a superficial knowledge, sought to add the distinction of F.S.A. to their names.</p>
<p>In the same year he was appointed secretary of the Camden Society, which position he held for thirty-five years. In 1863 Mr. Thoms was appointed Deputy Librarian of the House of Lords; this post, in consequence of old age, he resigned in 1882.</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms’s first work, ‘Early Prose Romances,’ was published in 1827-28, followed in 1834 by ‘Lays and Legends of Various Nations’, issued in monthly parts at half-a-crown, Mr. Thoms choosing for his motto the words of Sir John Malcolm, “He who desires to be well acquainted with a people will not reject their popular stories or local superstitions.” In 1838 he wrote ‘The Book of the Court, giving the Origin, Duties, and Privileges  of the Nobility and of the Officers of State.’ And in 1845, to show that he was not always engaged on historic doubts, under the title of ‘Gammer Gurton’s Pleasant Stories’ he published a delightful little Christmas book for children, beautifully illustrated, and printed by the Chiswick Press. The book is inscribed by Ambrose Merton, Gent., F.S.A., who, “in all hearty good will and affection, dedicates these world-renowned Stories to the Parents and Children of Merrie England.” He also completed an edition of Stow’s ‘Survey of London’ and various other works, among these two volumes of ‘Choice Notes from <em>Notes and Queries</em>: History and Folk-Lore,’ 1858 and 1859, long since out of print. Thoms also published three notelets on Shakespeare, articles from <em>Notes and Queries</em>, and a book on ‘ The Longevity of Man, its Facts and its Fictions’. In my much valued copy the author has written “ With the writer’s best regards.” The publisher of this was his friend and an old contributor, Mr. F. Norgate. In <em>Notes and Queries</em>, February 20th, 1875, appears a note by my father of ‘ A Centenarian’ known to him, Mrs. Coxeter, of Newbury, born at Witney February 1st, 1775, had just celebrated her hundredth Her death recorded in ‘N. &amp; Q.’ of December 2nd in the following year, and Mr. Thoms acknowledges the claim to be “ well authenticated.” The two friends would now and then have some fun over this when Mr. Thoms would put on his inimitable smile and say, “Ah! Mr. Francis, your friend must have been born in a Witney blanket.” <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Mrs.</span> <span class="pre">Coxeter’s</span> <span class="pre">husband</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">proprietor</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Greenham</span> <span class="pre">Mills,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">these</span> <span class="pre">mills</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">celebrated</span> <span class="pre">Throckmorton</span> <span class="pre">coat</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">made</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">one</span> <span class="pre">day,</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">sheep</span> <span class="pre">being</span> <span class="pre">shorn</span> <span class="pre">at</span> <span class="pre">five</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">morning,</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">wool</span> <span class="pre">made</span> <span class="pre">into</span> <span class="pre">cloth,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">coat</span> <span class="pre">completed</span> <span class="pre">so</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">be</span> <span class="pre">worn</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">Sir</span> <span class="pre">John</span> <span class="pre">Throckmorton</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">same</span> <span class="pre">evening.</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">coat,</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">illustrating</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">event,</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">shown</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Exhibition</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">1851,</span> <span class="pre">Mr.</span> <span class="pre">Coxeter's</span> <span class="pre">son,</span> <span class="pre">whose</span> <span class="pre">friendship</span> <span class="pre">I</span> <span class="pre">still</span> <span class="pre">enjoy.</span> <span class="pre">presented</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">copy</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">print</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">Mr.</span> <span class="pre">Gladstone,</span> <span class="pre">who</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">greatly</span> <span class="pre">interested</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">it.]</span></code></p>
<p>Mr. Thoms in a letter addressed to Prof. Owen, entitled ‘Exceptional Longevity,’ published in 1879, tells the origin of his investigations. For the first twelve months after he had started <em>Notes and Queries</em> he used to insert, without the slightest doubt as to their accuracy, all the various cases of exceptional longevity which were sent to him. Mr. Dilke would good naturedly quiz him on his fondness “ for the big gooseberry style of communications,” so that when Sir George C. Lewis sent to him a paper on ‘Centenarians’ (3rd S. i. 281) his mind was prepared to go into the question. Mr. Thoms was a great rambler among the —— bookstalls, and in this “ bookstalling” he and his friend Mr. Dilke were friendly rivals. Mr. Dilke on one occasion wrote to him, “Chancery Lane is my own manor, regularly haunted every Friday, and it is not to be endured that a mere poacher shall shake my own property in my own face.” The letter is signed “ Yours as you behave yourself.”</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms in his ‘ Gossip of an Old Book Worm’, which appeared in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em> in 1881, gives some interesting particulars as to his search for pamphlets and books among the bookstalls, when he would often meet Lord Macaulay on the same errand.</p>
<p>Mr. Thoms tells us that he had a love for books from his earliest years, the taste for them being encouraged by his father, who was a diligent reader of the <em>Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews</em>, his library containing a complete set of each. Being very short sighted, he was not able to join in sports like other boys. “There was only one branch of them in which I was an adept, and in these refined days I almost blush to refer to it. I was said to handle the gloves very nicely.”</p>
<p>The year 1872 was full of activity for Mr. Thoms. We find him busy investigating ‘Another Historic Doubt’—the death-warrant of Charles I. The numbers for July contain his notes on the subject ; these were afterwards reprinted, and rapidly passed through two editions. They were dedicated to one dear to him as a brother—” To the memory of that model of a Christian gentleman and accomplished scholar, my forty years’ friend, John Bruce.” Then came his farewell to ‘N. &amp; Q.’, and only four weeks after his ‘Parting Note’ a banquet was given in his honour. On the 1st of November such an assemblage as is rarely witnessed met at Willis’s Rooms.The chairman was Karl Stanhope, Lord Lyttelton occupied the vice chair, and the company included, among other equally well-known names, the Earl of Verulam, Sir Frederick Pollock, Sir Charles W. Dilke, Sir Edward Smirke, Prof. Owen, Mr. Joseph Durham, R.A., Mr. Shirley Brooks, and Mr John Murray.</p>
<p>A report of the proceedings is printed on the 9th of November. Earl Stanhope in the course of his speech said that</p>
<p>“it was as Editor of Notes and Queries from its foundation that they were now met to do him [Mr. Thoms] honour. The distinguishing merit of that periodical was that it did not pursue its inquiries into any one branch of knowledge, but invited co-operation from labourers in different fields of knowledge in the elucidation of difficulties.”</p>
<p>Among other speakers were Mr. Benjamin Moran, United States Chargé d’Affaires, who bore testimony to the appreciation in America of Mr. Thoms’s labours; Prof. Owen, who thanked Mr. Thoms in the name of men of science whose researches he has assisted in the pages of ‘N. &amp; Q.’; and Sir Frederick Pollock. Mr. Thoms in the course of his reply said all “during all the time he had conducted <em>Notes and Queries</em> he never had so difficult a query proposed as that which occurred to him tonight, ‘What have I done to deserve this great honour ?’” Among the many friends who wrote to congratulate him upon the success of the evening there was no letter more valued than the one he received from his successor in ‘N, &amp; Q”.’ Dr. Doran wrote:</p>
<p>“Very sincerely do I congratulate you on the way in which you got through your trying position on Friday night. All around me felt for you while you were speaking, and admired how manfully your courage carried you over your emotion. A better speech could not have been made on such an occasion, and more hearty sympathy for the speaker could not have been shown, not merely by the loud applause, but by the quiet friendly and affectionate comments and phrases interchanged among neighbour-guests while you were doing battle with your feelings, and yet preserving your self-possession and your characteristic humour. It was a night to be remembered.”</p>
<p>With this celebration Mr. Thom’s public life may be said to have closed. The next thirteen years were passed for the most part quietly in the sanctuary of home, surrounded by those he loved, until the end came, in the old home endeared to him by so many memories. His life had been so long that few of his earlier friends had been spared to follow him to the cemetery at Brompton. My companion on that oceasion was one of his oldest friends and contributors, Mr. Hyde Clarke, since passed to his rest. The Atheneum of the 14th of last month announced the death of another of his old friends, Col. Francis Grant. Mr. Thoms’s library of some fifteen thousand volumes, which included a large collection of works on Pope and Junius, was sold by Messrs. Sotheby in February, 1887.</p>
<p>In this little record of Mr. Thoms’s life I have been aided by his eldest son, Mr. Merton Thoms. I have also to thank him for allowing me to make a copy of a photograph taken by Dr. Diamond, so that the readers of ‘N. &amp; Q.’ may be in possession of this interesting souvenir of our founder. The words are facsimiled from those written by Mr. Thoms on the back of a portrait which he gave to my father. I have been trying to persuade Mr. Merton Thoms to give us a volume about his father, to include some of the rich stores of correspondence now in his possession.</p>
