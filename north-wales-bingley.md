It is an opinion very prevalent within the diocefe 
of St. David's in Pembrokefhire, that a fhort time 
previous to the death of a perfon, a light is fome- 
times feen to proceed from the houfe, and even from 
the bed, and to purfue its way to the church where 
the body is to be interred, precifely in the fame 
track that the funeral will afterv/ards follow. This 
light is call canwyll corph, or " the corpfe candle." 

A ftrange cuftom prevails in fome obfcure parts 
of North Wales, which, however, the clergy have 
now almofl abolifhed. This is termed the " offer- 
ing of an enemy." When a perfon fuppofes himfelf 
highly injured by any one, he repairs to fome church 
dedicated to a celebrated faint, or one who is be- 
lieved to have great power over the affairs of men ; 
here kiieeling on his bare knees before the altar, 
and offering a piece of money to the faint, he utters

the mofl virulent and dreadful imprecations, calling 
down curfes and misfortunes on the offender and 
his family even for generations to come. Some- 
times the offended perfons repair for the fame pur- 
pofe to fome facred well, dedicated to a faint. Mr. 
Pennant was threatened by a man, who fancied he 
had been injured by him, " with the vengeance of 
St. Elian, and a journey to his well, to curfe him 
witheffea*."

It is ufual in feveral parts of North Wales, for 
the neareft female relation to the deceafed, be fhe 
widow, mother, filler, or daughter, to pay fome poor 
perfon, of the fame fex, and nearly of the fame age 
with the deceafed, for procuring flips of yew, box, 
and other evergreens, to flrew over and ornament 
the grave for fome weeks after interment ; and in 
fome inftances for weeding and adorning it, on the 
eves of Ealler, Whitfuntide, and the other great 
feflivals, for a year or two aftei wards. This gift is 
called Diodlys, and it is made on a plate at the door 
of the houfe, where at the fame time the body is 
(landing on a bier. It had its name from the cuflom, 
which is now difcontinued, of the female relative 
giving to the perfon a piece of cheefe with the money 
fluck in it, fome white bread, and afterwards a cup 
of ale. — When this previous ceremony is over, the 
clergyman, or, in his abfence, the parifh clerk, re- 
peats the Lord's prayer ; after which they proceed 
with the body to the church. Four of the next of 
kin take the bier upon their flioulders j a cuflom

which Is confidercd as expreflive of the highefl mark 
that even filial piety can pay to the deceafed. If the 
diftance from the houfe to the church be coiifi- 
derabie, they are reheved by fome of the congrcga* 
tion ; but they always take it again before they 
arrive at the church. — I have been informed that in 
Ibme parts of the country it is ufual to fet the bier 
down at every crofs-way, and again when they enter 
the church-yard, and at each of thefe places to repeat 
tfie Lord's prayer* 

In fome parts of Wales it was formerly cuftomary 
for the friends of the dead to kneel on the grave^ 
and there to fay the Lord's prayer for feveral Sun- 
^ days fubfequent to the interment, and then to drefs 
the grave with flowers. — It was alfo reckoned fortu* 
nate for the deceafed if a fhower of rain came on 
while they were carrying the body to church, that 
his cofHn might be moiilened with the tears of 
heaven.
