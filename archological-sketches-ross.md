The following are 
matters which the author ascribes to the middle 
ages, at least he can assign no earlier date. 

The first is the singular custom, now obsolete, 
of Siii-eathig. 

It appears, that so late as the seventeenth 
century, there was in the villages, adjoining to 
Wales, an old man, called the Sin-eater; and his 
office was, for a trifling compensation to pawn 
his own soul for the ease and rest of the soul 
departed; Ellis, the editor of the Popular Anti- 
quites has extracted the following curious passage 
from the Lansdowne Manuscripts, concerning a 
Sin-eater, who "lived iu a cottage, on Rosse 
highway." 

"la the county of Hereford was an old custom 
at Funerals to hire poor people, who were to take 
upon them the sinnes of the party deceased. 
One of them (he was a long, leant, ugly, lamen- 
table poor Rascal) I remember lived in a cottage 
on Rosse highway. The manner was, that when 
the Corps was brought out of the house, and layd

On the Biere, a loafe of bread was broughl oai, 
and delivered to the Sinne-eater, over the Corws, 
as also a mazar bowl of maple, full of beer [whsca 
he was to drink up] atid sixpence in money, in 
consideration whereof lie took upoa him, ipai) 
Jaclo, all the sinnes of the defunct, and freed hira 
or her from walking after they were dead. This 
custome alludes methinks, something to the Scape- 
Goate in the old lavve, Ltvit. chap. svi. v. 21, 
22. " And Aaron shall lay both his hands on tha 
head of the live Goate, and confesse over him all 
the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all theij: 
transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon 
the head of the Goate, and shall send him away 
by the hand of a fit man into the wikiernes?. 
And the Goate shall bear upon him all their ini- 
quities unto a land not inhabited ; and he shall 
let the Goate goe into the wilderness," 

This custome (ihough rarely used in our day,-) 
yet by some people was observed, even in ihe 
strictest time of the Presbyterian Government, as 
at Dynder (volens nolens the Parson of the Paiish) 
the kindred of a woman deceased there had this 
ceremouie punctually performed according to her 
will; and also the like w^as done at tha ciiy of 
Hereford iu those times, where a woman kept, 
many years before her deatli, a mazard boivle for

the Sinne-eater; and the like iu other places in 
this countie; as also in Brecon. I believe this 
custom was heretofore used all over Wales.*
