Mr. Moggridge then proceeded to. make some observations on the 
custom of * sin-eater and said,—The custom of employing the 
sin-eater probably obtained in ancient times throughout a - 
portion of Wales and its Marches. When a person died, the 
friends sent for the sin-eater of the district, who on his arrival 
placed a plate of salt on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt 
a piece of bread. He then muttered an incantation over the bread, 
which he finally ate—thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. 
This done he received his fee of 2s. 6d., and vanished as quickly as 
possible from the general gaze; for, as it was believed that he really 
appropriated to his own use and behoof the sins of all those over 
whom he performed the above ceremony, he was utterly detested 
in the neighbourhood—regarded as a mere Pariah—as one irre- 
mediably lost. In Caermarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, was a 
mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of the present 
century, the people were of a very lawless character. There 
the above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period, 
and going thence to those parts of the country where, from the esta- 

blishment of works, and from other causes, the people had more 
early become enlightened, he found the more absurd portions of the 
custom had been abandoned, while some still remained. Thus near 
Llanon, within twenty years, the plate, salt and bread were retained, 
—near Swansea (and indeed very generally) only the plate and salt. 
In a parish near Chepstow it was usual to make the figure of a cross 
on the salt, and cutting an apple or an orange into quarters, to put 
one piece at each termination of the lines. There were other slight 
variations in those parts of the custom still extant, as indeed variations 
existed in old times when it prevailed in all its profane absurdity, an 
instance of which might be found-in the adjoining county, as men- 
tioned by Aubrey in the Lansdowne MSS. at the ‘British Museum. 
(See Hone’s Year Book, p. 858.) “Inthe county of Hereford,” he 
says, “ was an old custom at funerals to hire poor people who were to

take upon them the sins of the party deceased. One of them (he was 
a long, lean, ugly, lamentable poor rascal) I remember lived in a 
cottage on Rosse highway. The manner was that, when the corpse 
was brought out of the house, and laid upon the bier, a loaf of bread 
was brought out, and delivered to'the sin-eater over the corpse, as 
also a mazard bowl of maple full of beer (which he was to drink up), 
and sixpence in money ; in consideration whereof he took upon him 
ipso facto all the. sins of the defunct, and freed him or her from 
walking after they were dead.” Here the same end was sought to be 
attained by a slightly different form. The difference in the fee was 
somewhat striking, from whence it might be argued that a Caermar- 
thenshire soul was worth five times as much as that of a Hereford- 
shire man—unless indeed it was not rather to be accounted for by 
supposing that the stout Marcher had fewer sins to get rid of. 

Mr. Allen observed that in reference to the custom of placing 
salt on a corpse he was able to bear testimony to its existence in 
another county (Pembroke), in which their Association met last year. 
When a poor person died, a plate with a heap of salt on it was 
placed on the body, and in the salt was stuck a lighted candle. He 
should like to ask Mr. Moggridge if there was any necessary con- 
nexion between the custom he had mentioned of the sin-eater, and 
the one just named by himself. He could not exactly see, but did not 
deny it. Some persons might think it was rather Romish in its 
nature. He did not see that there was any connexion between this 
custom and the introduction of the “sin-eater.” The popular notion, 
in Pembrokeshire, with reference to the placing of salt on the bodies 
of the dead, was that it kept away the evil spirit. It was usual, 
after the candle had been lighted, for the friends of the deceased to 
watch through the night over the body, in order that they might, by 
their — keep off the evil spirit. As regarded the salt, he 
— t it might be explained in this way—as an emblem of 
purification; it might be that the salt was for purification, and 
the candle for keeping evil spirits away. This was a subject, if 
any person took delight in it, on which further light may be 
thrown; for those meetings were not only for the purpose of 
stating what they knew, but also to induce a search for further 
information. 

The Rev. I. Burleigh James suggested as the origin of the custom 
the scapegoat mentioned in the Bible. 

Mr. Jelinger C. Symons would like to know whether this custom 
of sin-eating was extinct. If not, to send missionaries abroad would 
be a farce, while they had customs so disgusting at home. 

The President hoped they were not entering into the history of 
present customs, but into the history of past events. It struck him 
that even at the present day when that melancholy event took place, 
the death of an individual, there was always a certain respect paid to 
the corpse; it was not closed in the coffin, but was left open for a 
certain time for the inspection of friends; the room was hung, the

candles were lighted, and there was always a person in the room who 
remained during the time that exhibition took place. It was out 
of respect to the deceased that such ceremony took place,—he could 
not regard it in any other light; it had been continued from time 
immemorial; and, with every degree of respect he should entertain 
towards that custom, there was nothing in it that he could exclaim 
against. 

Mr. Jelinger C. Symons said, of course his impression was as to 
the custom of the “sin-eater.” Some part of the custom appears to 
arise out of respect to the dead. 

Mr. Moggridge said—Far be it from him to desire that anything 
he should advance should not be combated, for all he wished to get 
- at was truth. He thought that the gist of what fell from Mr. Allen 
was that there was no immediate connexion between the custom of 
sin-eater and the plate and the salt. Starting from the Carmarthen- 
shire valley, he found the most horrible portion of the custom dropped, 
and the rest still retained; and as he advanced still further he found 
that less remained. Mr. Aubrey, from whom he quoted, and who 
was a man of high character, said that the custom had existed both 
in Herefordshire and Shropshire. Mr. Aubrey told them he went to 
a cottage in Herefordshire, where he saw a man whom he described 
as the sin-eater; and he (Mr. Moggridge) found, in the very district 
where Mr. Aubrey had seen it in its most horrid perfection, that the 
more odious part of the custom had been removed, but portions 
thereof still remained. He thought that the plate and salt were of 
eastern origin. There was only one thing more that he need trouble 
them with, and that was as to whether the custom was extinct. He 
believed that people were thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one 
case, he was informed, occurred four or five years ago, but he believed 
it was extinct now. 

Mr. Freeman inquired whether sin-eater was the term used in the 
district where the custom prevailed? 

Mr. Moggridge replied in the affirmative.
