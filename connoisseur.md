in the North; where I was mightily diverted with the tra- 


- ditional fuperftitions,-which are moft religioufly preferved 


in the family, as they’ have been delivered down, ‘time out 
of mind, from their fagacious grandmothers, | 

Wuen I arrived, I found the miftrefs of the houfe very 
bufily employed with her two daughters in.nailing an horfe- 
fhoe to the threfhold of the door. This they told me,: was 
to guard againft the fpiteful defigns of an old woman, who 
was a witch, and had threatened to do the family a mif- 
chief, becaufe one of my young coufins laid two ftraws 
acrofs, to fee if the old hag could walk over them. The 


young lady herfelf affured me, that fhe had feveral times 


heard Goody Cripple muttering to herfelf; and to be fu: 
fhe was faying the Lord’s Prayer backwards. ~Befides, the 
old woman had very often afked them for a pin: but ¢! 
took care never to give her any thing that was fharp, becau‘s 
fhe fhould not bewitch them, They afterwards told me 
many other particulars of this kind, the fame as aré men- 
tioned with infinite humour by the Specraror: and to 
confirm them, they aflured me, that the eldeft Mifs, when 
fhe was little, ufed to have fits, till the mother flung a knife 
at another old witch, (whem the devil had carried off in a 
high wind) and fetched blood from her, 


Wuen I was to go to bed, my aunt made a thoufand 
apologies for not putting me in the beft room inthe houfe, 
which fhe faid had never been lain in, fince the death of an 
old wafher-woman, who walked every night, and haunted 
that room in particular. They fancied that the old woman 
had hid money fomewhere, and could not reft till fhe had 


told fomebody; and my coufin affured me, that fhe might 
have .had it all to herfelf, for the fpirit came one night to 
her bed-fide, and wanted to tell her, but the had not’cou-

rage to {peak to it. I learned alfo that they had a footman 
once, who hanged himfelf for love ; and he walked for.a 
great while, till they got the parfon to lay him in the 


Red Sea. 


I uap not been here long, when an accident happened, 
which very much alarmed the whole family. Towzer one 
night howled moft terribly ; which was a fure fign, that 
fomebody belonging to them would die. The youngeft 
Mifs declared that fhe had heard the hen crow that morn- 
ing; which was another fatal prognoftic, They told me, 


that juft before uncle died, Towzer howled fo for feveral 


nights together, that they could not quict him; and my aunt 
heard the death-watch tick as plainly as if there had been 
a clock in the room: the maid too, who fat up with him, 


heard a bell toll at the top of the ftairs, the very moment 
the breath went out-of his body, During this difcourfe, I 


overheard one of my coufins whifper the other, that. the 
was afraid their mamma would not live long; for fhe {melt 
an ugly fmell, like adead body. They had a dairy-maid, 
who died the very week after an hearfe had ftopt at their 
door in its way to church ; and the eldeft mifs, when fhe 
was but thirteen, faw her own brother’s ghoft, (who was 
gone to the We/t-Indies) walking in the garden ; and to be 
fare nine months after, they had an account, that he died 
on board the fhip, the very fame day, and hour of the day, 
that Mifs faw his apparition. 


I NEED not mention to you the common incidents, 
which were accounted by them no lefs prophetic. If a 
cinder popped from the fire, they were in hafte to examine 
whether it was a purfe or a coffin. They were aware of 
my arrival long before I came, becaufe they had feen a 
ftranger on the grate, The youngeft Mifs will let nobody

ufe the poker but herfelf ; becaufe, when fhe ftirs it, it 
always burns bright, which is a fign the will have a bright 
hufband : and fhe is no lef fure of a good one,. becaufe the 
generally has ill luck at cards. Nor is the candle lefs ora- 
cular than the fire: for the fquire of the parifh came one 
night to pay them a vifit, when the tallow winding-fheet 
pointed towards him, and he broke his neck foon after in a 
fox-chafe. My aunt one night obferved with great pleafure 
a letter in the candle ; and fhe hoped it would be from her 
fon in London, We knew, when a fpirit was in the room, 
‘by the candle burning blue: but poor coufin Nancy was 
ready to cry one time, when fhe fnuffed it out and could 
not blow it in again, thoughvher fifter did it at a whiff.
