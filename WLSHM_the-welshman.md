AN OLD WELSH CUSTOM.—A very pretty usage, which eventually died away (although it has ben partially revived in some places), was that of the Plygain, which consisted in holding an early service on Christmas morning in the Church, illuminated for the occasion. At four o'clock, a.m., the bells rang- out merrily, and the singers proceeded to the parsonage to escort the vicar to the church porch, lighting up the roads with their torches, and singing carols lustily. Crickhowell, in Breconshire, was noted for its Plygain, though it has been discontinued for some years, the vicar and inhabitants preferring their slumbers to the early ser- vice. It is, I believe, carried cut as in days of yore in the parish of Llanover, in Monmouthshire, the Welsli character of which village is carefully kept up by Lady Llanovcr, all enthusiast in nationality and Welsh flannel.- Once a JTeek.

A WELSH SUPERSTITION. While on the subject of deaths I must mention a singular superstitious custom which lingered, long ago, in some of the secluded mountain vales of Carmarthenshire. When a person died, his friends srut for the sin-eater of the district, who, for the small sum of half a crown, actually took upon himself the sins of the deceased, by the simple process of eating them. The plan of operation was this:-A loaf of bread was provided, which the sin-eater first placed upou the dead person's chest, then muttered some incantations over it, finally eating it. Will it be credited that be was beilved to have taken from the defunct the heivy weight of his sins, and to appropriate them to himself, for which act of kindness he was regaroed by everybody as a tabooed outcast ? Indeed immediately after the cermony was finished, and he had received his pay, he vanished in double-quick time, it being the usual custom for the friends to belabour him with sticks-if they caught him.—Ibid.

IT is not often that a Welsh writer receives much; laudation in the leading London papers, and if it were only for that reason one cannot but feel it a pleasure to observe that the Standard devotes a tolerably full and kindly notice to Hearts of, Wales," the last published novel of Mrs. Puddi- combe (" Allen Raine.") In fact, the critic has very little fault to find with the work in any re- spect were it not for his English horror of place- names in their "native orthography," and an oc- casional sprinkling of Welsh words in the dia- logue. It is a grievance even to speak of Owen Glyndwr, seeing that this "gentleman used to be referred to as Glendower in the "history books of our childhood." The old "Welsh Re- volt which Glyndwr excited affords plenty of romantic material for a novel. A day may oome when some clever writer will throw a fictitious halo over the inglorious "Revolt" of our days, with its accompaniment of burdened ratepayers, of over-worked and half-starved teachers, and its thousands of innocent little ones sacrificed o the political Baal. If one may judge from the events of Welsh history, men's hearts have not softened greatly in the last four or five hundred years. A stain, one abominable stain, rests on Glyndwr's name because there is a story (not a very accu- rate one perhaps) told of his having set fire to a house which sheltered the wife and children oi one who betrayed or deserted his cause. Nowa- days we have great lights in the political and even the religious world who treat the persecution of children as a very small matter, especially if they are the offspring of that evil stock whic4 craves for dogma," and will not fall into line n, with some ambitious plotters' schemes for their own aggrand isement. But the reviewer of Mrs. Puddioombe's new book, being less discursive than we, and less interested in Welsh affairs, does not touch upon these considerations. A few of his re- marks may be worth quoting. He says the book is composed with a pleasant briskness of style, and some measure of skill in the grouping ot events. The characterisation, save in one in- stance, calls for no remark. The one really romantic and original figure of the tale is that of the so-called sin-eater, a social pariah, whose duty it was to eat the food exposed upon every corpse before burial, and by so doing to take on himself. the weght of the dead man's sins. The sin-eater in this instance was a fraud as far as his weird office was concerned, for he had merely adopted the role in order the more successfully to hide his identity; but the picture of his lonely existence, shunned by mankind, save when death was abroad and summoned by a tinkling bell from his secret abode to perform a loathed duty, is vividly real- ised, and has inspired the authoress to her most successful pages." The praise awarded to "Allen Raine" is not, of course, extravagant, but there must be a good deal of merit in a Welsh novelist) who is treated so respectfully by one of the oldest and most respected of the Metropolitan journals.
