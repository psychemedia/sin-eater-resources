THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS

Among English, Scotch, and Welsh peasants, sin-eating, which was once a universal custom, still in remote localities is occasionally observed. [*Ethnology and Folklore*, 117.] Though no longer anywhere in Christendom, so far as I know, is any one baptised for the dead, yet at the funerals of these peasants to whom I have just referred, poor people are hired to eat a "sin-loaf," and thus to take upon themselves the sins of the dead. The same custom of sin-eating for the dead obtains in Turkestan. [Golden Bough, II. 155.] This sin-eating [Cf. Hos. iv. 8., and references below ; also *Water of Jealousy*, Num. v. 11-31] was an important element in the rationale of the sacrificial meal of the priests, according to the Levitical code. By the eating of the sacrifice over which the sins had been confessed, and to which, by imposition of hands, the sins had been transferred, the priest was supposed to have taken into himself the sin or the guilt of it. The theory was that the holiness of the priesthood in this manner neutralised the virus of the substance of sin. If, however, by the defective holiness of the priest, or from any other cause, some sin remained unneutralised, it passed up to the high priest, who once a year transferred it by imposition of hands to a scapegoat. [Willis, Worship of the Old Covenant, I. 43.] An American theologian has extended this idea of pardon through sin-eating by asserting that the Eucharist is the Sacrament of Absolution. In this ancient theory and practice of sacrifices do we rightly discern the beginning of the origin of the revelation of a mediator and redeemer. [Professor Robertson Smith, who to me is not perfectly clear, seems (*Religion of the Semites*, 330 ff.) to dissent from this explanation of sin offering].

The transference of guilt to a sin-bearer is a common element of Folk-faith. When a Moor has a headache he will sometimes take a lamb or goat and beat it till it falls down, and he believes that the headache has then been transferred to the animal. [*Golden Bough*, II. 149. Cf. Lev. xiv. 7, where a bird is let dy to carry away a taboo.]

In Travancore, when the Rajah is very ill, a Brahmin is brought in who embraces him and voluntarily assumes the guilt of the Rajah's sin, saying, "Oh, King, I undertake to bear away all your sins and diseases ; may your Highness live long and reign happily." The Brahmin sin-bearer is then thrust forth from the country, to which he may never return. Superstitious sailors in order to ease their ship of misfortune will maroon one of their fellows. Jonah's crew cast him overboard to save themselves, by offering him a sacrifice to the angry god.
