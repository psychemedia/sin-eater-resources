SOME heat has been engendered over the ques- tion whether the picturesque profession of the sin-eater ever had any real existence in Wales or is the creation of the antiquarian imagination. It is asserted by students of folk-lore that a custom prevailed according to which the friends of a deceased man either themselves ate food passed over his body or engaged a substitute to do so in their behalf, the belief being that the sins of the dead were in this manner transferred to the living persons who took part in the ceremony. Mr. Sidney Hartland and other authorities contend that the account given of this superstition by Aubrey, a seventeenth century writer, can be confirmed not only from the pages of Pennant but from a considerable mass of more recent evidence. It must be confessed that the instances adduced by Mr. Hartland in his letter on the subject are hardly coiivinCiDg. A few isolated cases of curious ceremonies in dispensing the cold meats and strong liquors provided at burials prove nothing except that funeral etiquette varies accor- ding to localities. Mr. Hartland admits that there are no modern instances of ritual words being used, so that the significance of the rites can only be inferred from the interpretation supplied by Aubrey, which may be conjectural. There is no reference to the alleged superstition, so far as we know, in Vicar Prichard'a "Canwyll y Cymru," though he severely condemns a number of magical practices. Canon Silvan Evans, with a consider- able experience of funeral and a learned interest in folk-lore, never came across any vestige of the custom, and other competent investigators have likewise failed. In the interest of romance it is to be hoped that the sin-eater will not turn out so disappointing as the famous inscription dis- covered by Mr. Pickwick, which proved, on fuller inquiry, to be nothing more than "Bill Stumps His Mark," but his reality is clearly not yet I established.
