TIPYN O BOB PETH

The superstition of the Sin Eater, a poor half starved wretch, bribed by a dole of bread, beer, and a sixpence, to attend at a funeral, and by accepting such a tender to take upon him the sins of the defunct, is noticed in the same volume [ "the Year Book"], and referred to certain counties in North and South Wales, where we have reason to believe it still exists."

LEGENDS AND FOLKLORE OF NORTH WALES.-The following letter has appeared in the Academy. "LIanymawdd- wy Rectory. Merioneth November S:h, 1875 In the Academy of November (ith, (p 478) I find an extract from }n BJas-kwooi on the "Legends and Folklore of .North Wales, referring to a singular custom said to be still surviving in North and South Wales. It is alleged that at a funeral" a hireling, who lives by such services, has handed over to him a loaf of bread, a maole bowl full of beer or milk, and a sixpenc, in consideration of which be takes upon him all the sins of the defunct, and frees °r WalkLUrj *'beT deafch this functionary it is added, is currently called a Sin-eater The earlier portion of my life was 3pent in South Wales, and I have lived upwards of a quarter of a century in North Vales* hr>f I have never heard of the strange custom here alluded to either as now existing or as having existed at some former perioc. I have not been indifferent as to the customs and legends of the land of my birth, and my profession often brings me in contact, with funerals but I have never found a trace of such a custom, asd I have but little hesitation in saying that it is altogether unknown in :he Principality. If the writer of the anick will give me the name of any lo- c.ility where the superstition flourishes, I will at once visit the place and institute enquires on the spot. At the same time he will, I hope, favour me with the Welsh equivalent of "Sin-eater," for I am interested in Welsh words as well as in Welsh customs and legends. D. SILVAN EVANS

T fills. THE älN EATER. The Academy of Nov. 20, contains the following letter on the subject, in reply to the Rev. Silvan Evans :— In reference to the strange profession of 4 Sin-Eater, mentioned by the writer in Blackwood and doubted by your able correspondent, the Rev. Silvan Evans,let me refer him and your ,eaderi to a well-kuown work, Hons a learbook, on col. 858 of which will be found some records of the practice both in Wales and on the borders. One of the illustrations dates from Herefordshire, in which county, if I am not mistaken, the writer in Blackwood resides. Croeswylan, Oswestry. ASKEW ROBERTS. Thp fcllmninor is the information given by Hone m his Year Book, col. 858 According to Lawrence Howell, History of the Pontificate, Pope Alexander, in the second century, from the passage in Hosea, They eat up the sin of my people," implied that the priest by prayers and offerings did this for the worshippers. In later times, how- ever, Sin Eating ha^ been a very much more vuigar affair, and a letter fr.nn John B ^ford, written in 1715, and printed in Leland's Collectanea,, gives the following account of a Sin Eater on the Borders:— -Within the memory of our fathers, in Shropshire, in those villages adjoining to IV tles, when a person died, there was notice given to au old sire," (for so they called hun) Pre- sently repaired to the yl*ce where the deceased_lay, and1 stood before the door of the house, when some of -he family came out and furnished him with a cricket (or stool) on which he sat down facing the door. Then ^hey gave him a groa. which he put in his pocket; a crust of bread, which lie a^e a full bowl of ale, which he drank off at a draught. Af er this lie go. up from the cricket, and pronounced, with a. composed gesture, 11 the ease and rest of the soul depurted, for which he would pawn bis own soul." /• .• e t(il. Bagford states that he received hIS intormauon now t-Lie ingenious John Aubrey, Esq., who made a collection of curious observations," which he had seen. Among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum may be found accounta of this singular custom, in Aubrey's own hand- writing. In these he tells of a long, lean, ugly, lament- able poor rascal" who lived in a cottage on Rosse highway, Hereford, who was a proessional Sin-Eater. He also says there was a like practice at Brecon at Llanygors, where Mr Gwyn the minister about 1640 could not hinder the performance of this ancient custom." In 1686 Mr Aubrey says the custom was prevalent in North Wales.

) BYE-GONES I December 22, 1875.  ASKEW ROBERT-: THE SIN EATER (Dec. 1, 1875.)-The Western Mail, Dec. 16, contains a letter tigned RHEIDIOL. Twmbarlwu, on this tub- jeet, in which, after narrating the facts already stated, the writer uroceeds to say :-I lived at LIandebie many years ago, and I am well acquaintc i with the history of that pari^n its customs and tradition?, and from time to time I attended fuuerals, but I never heard of such a tlnns;. I am well ac- quainted with Wel-h lore in aimost every parish in South AValeswhich Icollected for the Into Sir Thomas Phillips, Bart., and I never heard of its existence. The Welsh peasant may be a little f-uperstitious, but he is far too intelligent to bdieve in such a thing as a Sin Eater. This is simply a fling at the Welsh nation. I hope, for the credit of the Cambrian Associa- tion, that they have hetier foundation for the papers read at their meetings than the Sin-Eater."

THE BIN-EATER IN WALES. The discussion on this subject, commenced in the Academy, and continued in that and other papers, was fully given in Bye-gones towards the close of last year. Our readers will remember that the discussion arose on a challenge by a well-known and able Welshman, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, to the writer of an article in Blackwood, on the Folk Lore of Wales, to prove his assertion that ever such a personage as the Sin-Eater" existed in the Prin- cipality. One or two replies appeared, referring to Aubrey, as the original authority that such an office once existed and the writer of the article expressed his surprise that Mr Evans, wh'f',e connection with the Archccotogia Com,- brensis was well known, should not be aware that Mr had stated at the meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society in 1852, that the custom bad pre- vailed at or near Llandtbie, Caermarthenshire, within tive years of that date. The substance of this we gave Dec 1. 1875, and on Dec. 20 a letter from the Western Mail written, as we are now informed, by Mr John Rowlands who had been a schoolmaster at Llandebie for many years, commencing 1850, and who denied the existence of the practice iu his time, or within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. In the Academy, Feb. 5, 187G. Mr Silvan Evans goes fully iato the matter, and gives as the result of his enquiries, a total denial of the practice as far as Wales is concerned in the course of which he publishes a letter from the Yicar of Llandel-.ie, who confirms all Mr Rowlands previously said. Mr Silvan Evans concludes that the whole story of the Sin-Eater rests on the shoulders of Aubrey," and he declines to place any faith in "so credu- lous a person in any case in which superstition plays a part." Mr Evans also explains that his connection with the orjan of the Cambrian Archaeological Society com- menced twenty years after the date of Mr Moggridge's communication.

THE SIIN-PA'fEtt IN WaLKX Further correspondence has appeared in the Academy on u,¡. question, bat no fresh licrH has been thrown on the alleged custom. On February 26kh, Mr E. R. Morris gives from Ruscoe's South Wales a quotation from the Mountain Decameron, in which" what, is 'heliev- a to have Veen the last Sin-Eater in Wales," is stated to hove lived somewhere between Aberystwyth and Machynlh" b, but Mr Askew Roberts, in the last number, show. by a further quotation from the book itself, that this was friy a fancy sketch, founded on Aubrey's "I-ane raFkal" In another letter, re- plving to one bv the author of the Blackwood article, Mr Silvan Evans defies that gentleman to mak" gool his asser- tion th.<tt tn.> ;"1perstition is "still surviving in North and South Wales."

LITERATURE. BRITISH GOBLINS Welsh Folk-Lore, Fairy Mythology, Legends and Traditions; by the Hon. Wirt Sykes, United States Consul for Wales. London, Sampson Low & Co. THIS is, to us, one of the most attractive books of the season. Not only has Mr. Svkes carefully culled from published sources —such as Peter Roberts's Cambrian Antiquities, Jones's Apparations," Cymru Fu," Cambro Briton,Bye-gones'" Archfeologia Cambrensis all that relates to his subject, but he has gone about amongst the people of South Wales for him- self, and taken down from the lips of the elders there old stories of bye-gone customs and once prevalent superstitions. May be that the author places too much confidence in some of those narratives; whether he does or not, they add greatly to the interest of his book, and readers can judge for themselves how much to put under the head of national superstitions," and how much to the credit merely of the foolish fancies of the narrators. We are glad to see that Mr. Sykes has investigated the" Sin Eater" fable. We don't believe an instance of-this practice was ever proved to have been observed in Wales, or Shropshire either, and the author, after giving all the "illustra- tions" he can gather, says:- „ Such is the testimony. I venture no opinion upon it further than may be conveyed in the remark that I cannot find any direct corroboration of it. I have not only seen no re- ference to it in Welsh writings, but I have never met with any unlettered Welshman who had ever heard of it." .

THE ANTIQUITIES OF TREGARON. At a meeting of the Literary Society, Mr D. Caron Rees read au interesting paper on the "Antiquities of Tregaron," of which the following is a summary...

...
There was also an old custom in the town connected with the sin eater." When there was a corpse in a house the "sin eater was invited. The relatives of the dead prepared him a meal and when eating the meal on the coffin he was supposed to eat the sina of the dead person, so as to make the deceased's journey upwards lighter.
