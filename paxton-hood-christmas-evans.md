Christmas Evans : the preacher of Wild Wales, his country, his times and his contemporaries

1888
p23-24

No doubt, the proclamation of the Gospel, 
and the elevated faith which its great truths bring 
in its train, broke the fascination, the charm, and 
power of many of these ; but they lingered even 
until within the last forty or fifty years, indeed, the 
superstition of the Sin-Eater is said to* linger even 
now in the secluded vale of Cwm-Aman, in Caer- 
marthenshire. The meaning of this most singular 
institution of superstition was, that when a person 
died, the friends sent for the Sin-Eater of the district, 
who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt and bread 
on the breast of the deceased person ; he then 
uttered an incantation over the bread, after which, 
he proceeded to eat it, thereby eating the sins of 
the dead person ; this done, he received a fee of two- 
and-sixpence, which, we suppose, was much more 
than many a preacher received for a long and painful 
service. Having received this, he vanished as swiftly 
as possible, all the friends and relatives of the de 
parted aiding his exit with blows and kicks, and other 
indications of their faith in the service he had ren 
dered. A hundred years since, and through the 
ages beyond that time, we suppose this curious 
superstition was everywhere prevalent. 

Another odd custom was the manner in which 
public opinion expressed itself on account of any 
domestic or social delinquency. A large crowd as-

sembled before the house of the delinquent, one of 
whom was dressed up in what seemed to be a 
horse s head ; the crowd then burst forth into strong 
vituperative abuse, accompanying the execrations 
with the rough music of old kettles, marrow-bones, 
and cleavers ; finally, the effigy of the sinner was 
burnt before the house, and the sacred wrath of the 
multitude appeased. The majesty of outraged 
opinion being vindicated, they dispersed.
