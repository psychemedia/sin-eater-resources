SYNOPSIS. 
INTRODUCTION : 

The relation of the Forgiveness of Sins to the purpose of 
the Church. Actual vs. forensic forgiveness. 

COMPARATIVE RELIGION: 

I. Theories of Forgiveness of Sins in folk-faith. 

a. The appeasement of an angry, evil, or non-moral 

deity. Origin of commercial theories of forgive- 
ness. The idea of fate and of fear as a religious 
motive. 

b. The substitution of another to bear the penalty of sin : 

the scapegoat theory in its various forms ; sin-eat- 
ing ; the worship of the sacrificial victim ; the 
divine scapegoat in Jewish theory, in the Norse 
Voluspa, and in the Prometheus Bound ; the bear- 
ing of this theory upon pessimism and the problem 
of Pain ; the survivals of the scapegoat and sub- 
stitutionary theory in modern Theology.

Among English, Scotch, and Welsh 
peasants, sin-eating, which was once a universal 
custom, still in remote localities is occasionally ob- 
served. 2 Though no longer anywhere in Christen- 
dom, so far as I know, is any one baptised for the 
dead, yet at the funerals of these peasants to whom 
I have just referred, poor people are hired to eat a 
" sin-loaf," and thus to take upon themselves the sins 
of the dead. The same custom of sin-eating for the 
dead obtains in Turkestan. 3 This sin-eating 4 was an

important element in the rationale of the sacrificial 
meal of the priests, according to the Levitical code. 
By the eating of the sacrifice over which the sins 
had been confessed, and to which, by imposition 
of hands, the sins had been transferred, the priest 
was supposed to have taken into himself the sin or 
the guilt of it. The theory was that the holiness of the 
priesthood in this manner neutralised the virus of the 
substance of sin. If, however, by the defective holi- 
ness of the priest, or from any other cause, some sin 
remained unneutralised, it passed up to the high 
priest, who once a year transferred it by imposition 
of hands to a scapegoat. 1 An American theologian 
has extended this idea of pardon through sin-eating 
by asserting that the Eucharist is the Sacrament of 
Absolution. In this ancient theory and practice of 
sacrifices do we rightly discern the beginning of the 
origin of the revelation of a mediator and redeemer. 2 
The transference of guilt to a sin-bearer is a com- 
mon element of Folk-faith. When a Moor has a 
headache he will sometimes take a lamb or goat and 
beat it till it falls down, and he believes that the 
headache has then been transferred to the animal. 3
