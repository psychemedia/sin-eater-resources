Sinne-eaters*  p24


It seems a remainder of this custom w*^^ lately obtained at 
Amersden, in the couniy of Oxford, where at the burial of every 
corps one cake and one flaggon of Ale just after the interrment 
were brought to the minister in the CL porch. W. K.

Sinne-'eaters. [See pp. 18, 22.] p35?
In the County of Hereford was an old Custome at ftmeralls to 
Ih ^1 P^^^ people, who were to take upon them all the sinnes of 

the party deceased. One of them I remember lived iu a cottage 
on Bosse-high way. (He was a long, leane, ugly, lamentable poor 
raskal.) The manner was that when the Corps was brought out 
of the house and layd on the Biere ; a Loafe of bread was brought 
out, and delivered to the Sinne-eater over the corps, as also a 
Mazar-bowle of maple (Gossips bowle) full of beer, w*^^ he was to 
drinke up, and sixpence in money, in consideration whereof he 
tooke upon him (ipso facto) all the Sinnes of the Deftmct, and 
freed him (or her) from walking after they were dead. This cus- 
tome alludes (methinkes) something to the Scape-goate in y® old 
Lawe. Leviticus, cap. xvi. verse 21, 22. "And Aaron shall lay 
both his hands on the head of the live goate and confesse over 
him all y* iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their trans- 
gressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the 
goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fitt man into 
the wildemesse. And the goat shall bear upon him all their 
iniquities, unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let the goat

goe into the wildemesse." This Gostome (though rarely used in 

our dajes) yet by some people was j t'nuedl ®^®^ ^ ^^ 
strictest time of y® Presbyterian goverment: as at Dynder, 

relations I ^^ a woman 
deceased there had this ceremonie punctually performed according 
to her Will : and also the like was donne at y* City of Hereford 
in these times, when a woman kept many yeares before her 
death a Mazard-bowle for the Sinne-eater ; and the like in other 
places in this Countie ; as also in Brecon, e, g. at Llangors, 
where Mr. Gwin the minister about 1640 could no hinder y* 
performing of this ancient custome. I believe this custome was 
heretofore used over all Wales. 

See Juvenal Satyr, vi. [519-521,] where he speakes of 
throwing purple thread into y® river to carry away ones sinne. 

In North- Wales, the Sinne-eaters are frequently made use of; 
but there, insted of a Bowie of Beere, they have a bowle of 
Milke. 

Methinkes, Doles to Poore people with money at Funeralls have 
some resemblance of that of y® Sinne-eater. Doles at Fimeralls 
were continued at Gentlemens funeralls in the West of England 
till the Civil- warre. And so in Germany at rich mens funerals 
Doles are in use, and to every one a quart of strong and good 
Beer. — Cramer.
