In another part of the \\nMusaum Tradescaiitianum may be found a list of \\nthe \"benefactors\" to the collection; and amongst \\n\\n\\n\\ntheir names occurs that of William Curteen, Esq. \\nNow this \"\\\\\\\\\\'iniam Curteen and his father Sir \\nWilliam, of Flemish descent, were the most ex- \\ntensive British merchants of the time, and had \\nnot only ships trading to, but also possessed forts \\nand factories on, some of the islands of the \\nEastern Archipelago, the native habitat of tlie \\nsapotaceous tree that yields the gutta percha. \\nCurteen was a collector of curiosities himself, and \\nno doubt his captains and agents were instructed \\nto procure such : in short, a specimen of gutta \\npercha was just as likely to attract the attention \\nof an intelligent Englishman at Amboyna in the \\nfifteenth century, as it did at Singapore in the \\nnireteenth. \\n\\nIf there are still any remains of Tradescant\\'s \\ncollection in the Ashraolcan Museum at Oxford, \\nthe question, whether the Mazer wood was gutta \\npercha or not, might be soon set at rest ; but it is \\nhighly probable that the men who ordered the \\nrelics of the Dodo to be thrown out, showed but \\nlittle ceremony to the Mazer wood or dishes. \\n\\nA curious instance of a word, not very dissimilar \\nto Mazer, may be found in Eric Red\\'s Saga, part \\nof the Flat\\'o Annals, supposed to be written in the \\ntenth century, and one of the authorities for the \\npre-Columbian discovery of America by the Ice- \\nlanders. Karlsefne, one of the heroes of the Saga, \\nwhile his ship was detained by a contrary wind in \\na JTorwegian port, was accosted by a German, who \\nwished to purchase his, Karlsefne\\'s, broom. \\n\\n\" \\' I will not sell it,\\' said Karlsefne. \\' I will give \\nyou half a mark in gold for it,\\' said the German man. \\nKarlsefne thought this a good offer, and thereupon \\nconcluded the bargain. Tile German man went away \\nwith the broom. Karlsefne did not know what wood \\nit was ; but it was Masur, which had come from Wine- \\nland!\" \\n\\nPerhaps some reader may give an instance of \\nMazer wood being mentioned by other writers ; or \\ninform me if the word Mazer, in itself, had any \\npeculiar signification.

W. Thomas, of \\nOswestry, on the above subject. Armed with that \\nletter, I spent half a day at the British Museum, \\nand looked through everything that Mr. Thomas \\nrefers to as bearing on the matter. I was already \\nfamiliar with Joseph Downes’s tale in the ‘ Moun- \\ntain Decameron,’ but as I am no folk-lorist, that \\nwas about the extent of my own knowledge. It \\nseems that the “authorities” for the alleged \\ncustom are (1) Aubrey ; (2) Mr. Matthew Mogg- \\nridge, of Swansea ; and (3) Pennant. \\n\\nThe important statement as affecting South \\nWales is Mr. Moggridge’s, made at the sixth \\n—s of the Cambrian Archeological Society \\nat Ludlow on 28 August, 1852. \\n\\nAfter describing the custom Mr. Moggridge \\n\\nsaid that— \\n“in Carmarthenshire, not far from Llandebie, there was \\n& mountain valley, where, up to the commencement of \\nthe present century, the people were of a very lawless \\ncharacter. There the practice was said to have pre- \\nvailed to a recent period...... He believed that people \\nwere thoroughly ashamed of the practice; one case, he \\nwas informed, occurred a few yeara ago, but he believed \\nit was extinct now.” \\n\\nMr. E. A. Freeman inquired whether “sin- \\neater was the term used in the district where the \\ncustom prevailed?” Mr. Moggridge ‘‘ answered \\nin the affirmative.” \\n\\nThat statement seems to have passed un- \\nchallenged, although there were Welshmen actually \\npresent—the late Mr. Wynne, of Peniarth, for \\ninstance, and the present Bishop of St. David\\'s. \\n\\nIt is greatly to Freeman’s credit that his scent \\nfor “facts” was keener than the Welshmen’s, even \\non their own ground. ‘“‘Sin-eater” has never \\nbeen adopted into the Welsh language, nor is \\nthere an equivalent term known in that language. \\nAnd yet ‘Mr. Moggridge must have had some \\nground for his assertion. On the supposition that \\nhe was acquainted with the Rev. John Williams, \\nwho was vicar of Llandebie and Bettws from 1804 \\nto 1850, I think I can give a possible explanation. \\nWhen, after Williams’s death in 1850, there \\nwas a sale of his effects at the vicarage, my father \\nbought a large quantity of Welsh periodicals and \\nbooks. Among these was Drych yr Amseroedd \\n(Mirror of the Times), by the Rev. Robert Jones, \\nof Rhoslan, Carnarvonshire. That little work was \\na great favourite of mine when I was a boy. Let \\nme translate a short passage :— \\n\\n“ Inquirer: I remember my grandfather mentioning \\nsomething called Diodlas or Diodles.

The manner of bestowing it was as follows: \\nthe family would send a cup to the coffin-maker, to be \\npainted of the same colour as the coffin (two colours \\nwere used in those times—black for married folk, white \\nfor the single); and when the day of the funeral arrived, \\nafter the body had been placed on the bier, the head of \\nthe family gave the alms to the poor person selected, \\nthat is to say, a big loaf of good bread, and a large chunk \\nof cheese with a piece of silver stuck in it, and the \\npainted cup full of ale (if ale there happened to be), \\notherwiee of milk, presenting them across the corpse to \\nthe poor person. \\nfervent blessings and prayers for (lit. along with) the \\nsoul of the dead.

And they wou\\'d never mention any deceased \\nmember or relation of the family without saying very \\noy * Heaven be his portion’ (Nefoedd iddo /),”— \\n\\n\\nThis custom will be familiar to the reader already, \\nno doubt, from Pennant’s ‘Tour’ (ii. p. 338, \\nLondon, 1784) ; bat the Welsh name, and several \\ngraphic touches besides, are not to be found in \\nPennant’s description, which, by the way, is evi- \\ndently derived from the same source as the account \\nin the British Magazine for 1835 (vol. vii. p. 399), \\nsaid there to be taken “from a MS. book of a \\nbishop of St. Asaph, written about a century ago.” \\n\\nI venture to suggest that it is this by no means \\nrepulsive old North Walian custom that has given \\nrise to the myth of the sin-eater. The only Welsh \\nterms for the alleged custom that Mr. Moggridge \\ncould possibly have heard are diodles and cwpan y \\nmeirw—both of them unknown in South Wales. \\n\\nOwen Pughe’s ‘ Welsh Dictionary’ (Gee, 1832) \\n\\nhas, under Diawdlestr :— \\n“A drinking cup; also a cup-full of drink, so called \\nsuperstitiously, given for the dead, which in some places \\nis called diawdlyst, and cwpan y meirw” (i,¢., the cup of \\nthe dead). \\n\\n“ Diawdlyst=the give-ale.” \\n\\nCanon Silvan Evans’s great ‘ Welsh Dictionary,’ \\nnow in course of publication, bas not yet, I believe, \\nreached D. It does not mention cwpan y meirw. \\n\\nI was very well acquainted, when a boy, with a \\nsmall farmer from what I must call the “ incri- \\nminated district,” who used to be in great request \\nas a post mortem barber. He would most cer- \\ntainly have informed me of such a practice had \\nit ever existed within his personal or traditional \\nknowledge. \\n\\nI may add that the opening of the “lawless” \\nvalley mentioned lies between the two parishes of \\nLiandebie and Bettws, and that Swansea is only \\nsome ten or twelve miles off. It is not only \\npossible, but highly probable that the aged vicar \\nSook two parishes = — dwelt on the \\n\\n‘opish”” superstition described so hically in \\nJones of Rhoslan’s little book. wliee d \\n\\nAt any rate, that is the only explanation I can \\nsuggest of the Cambrian Archzologists’ amusing \\n“comedy of errors.” Mr, Sidney Hartland must \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni \\n\\n\\nsearch somewhere else than in Lilandebie and \\n\\nCwmamman for evidence in support of his “ canni- \\n\\nbal” theory. J. P. Owen. \\n48, Comeragh Road, West Kensington. \\n\\n\\nP.S.—Perhaps I may be allowed to add that the \\nabove was sent for publication to ‘N. & Q.’ before \\nthe appearance of Mr. Sidney Hartland’s first letter \\nin the Academy (Nov., 1895), and that that gentle- \\nman had it before him, in the form of a letter from \\nme to Prof. Rhys, in October, 1895. \\n\\n\\nThe two customs mentioned under the above \\nheading are, in reality, quite reconcilable. Accord- \\ning to a widely disseminated folk-belief, when \\na man dies his essential principles, moral or \\notherwise, may be taken over by some one else, \\nthe matter being managed in various ways in \\ndifferent parts of the world. Thus, among certain \\nsavage peoples a successful warrior banquets on \\nthe body of the enemy he has killed, in order \\nto absorb his bravery and his other enviable \\ncharacteristics. It is said that in ancient Mexico \\nthe captor was under obligation to offer up his \\ncaptive at one of the solemn sacrificial feaste— \\nan important reason for the custom being, pro- \\nbably, that the prisoner\\'s virtues as a man should \\nbe transmitted to the conqueror, though, from \\nanother point of view, no doubt the unfortunate \\nsufferer was an earthly representative of the god to \\nwhom he was sacrificed. \\n\\nIn most cases where transference of moral or \\nvital powers is supposed to take place, the recipient \\nis thought to benefit ; but this is not a necessary \\npart of the belief. He may occupy the place of a \\nscapegoat, as does the Welsh sin-eater, and take \\nupon bimself all responsibility for the misdeeds of \\nthe deceased, although he more usually appro- \\npriates the good qualities of the dead. The idea \\nof freeing the defunct from his imperfections can \\nscarcely be so ancient as the more selfish notion of \\nseizing his virtues. It would seem to be an out- \\ngrowth from the more egotistical belief, aided to \\nsome degree in development by the influence of \\nreligious or quasi-religious environment. \\n\\n\\nThe ceremony of sin-eating as it was formerly practised in Scotland is described at p. 60 of Mr. \\nPhiselton Dyer’s ‘Domestic Folk-lore.’ If my \\nmemory serves me, there is a good deal of infor- \\nmation on this subject in ‘The Golden Bough,’ by \\nMr. Frazer. Cc. C. B. \\n\\n\\nMr. Elton, in ‘Origins of English History,’ \\n1882, pp. 181, 182, bas some interesting obser- \\nvations on sin-eating. He says, “ The superstition \\ncertainly prevailed in Herefordshire, though it may \\nbe doubful whether it extended to the neighbour- \\ning parts of Wales.” He quotes Aubrey’s ‘ Re- \\nmains of Gentilisme ’ (as every one writing on the \\nsubject does), and refers also to Sikes’s ‘ British \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKHOoOOow fF \\n\\n\\nMEWS ageeweowueaao \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nye rereer ae \\n\\n\\neo rmi Ff @eoeos \\n\\n\\n-eorws of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ng* 8. 1X.

He states, at \\np. 156, that the custom (of sin-eating in one form \\nor another) was existent, or quite recently existed, \\namong the Greeks and Scotcb, and possibly among \\nthe Dyaks and Gipsies. He quotes the incident \\nwhich occurred in 1851 or 1852, when the custom \\nwas still prevalent in Wales, and gives a reference \\nto the Archewologia Cambrensis, N.S., iii. (1852), \\n330. A curious variant of the custom is men- \\ntioned as surviving in Shropshire in 1892 (7olk- \\nLore, iv. pp. 392, 393). W. B. Gerisa. \\n\\nWormley, Herts. \\n\\n\\nIs Mr. Jonas acquainted with the articles on \\nthis subject in Brand’s ‘Popular Antiquities,’ \\nii. 152 (edit. 1841) ; Gentleman’s Magazine, xcii. \\n222; and ‘N. & Q.,’ 1\" 5. iv. 211; vi. 390, 541, \\nwhere references to other works are also given ? \\n\\nEverard Home CoLemay. \\n\\n71, Brecknock Road.',\n",
       " \"Notes and Queries\\n1896-02-29\\nVol 9 Iss 218\\n\\nFeb 29, 1896\\np169-170\\n\\n SIN - EATER, \\n(8 §, viii, 288, 332 ; ix. 109.) \\n\\nAs the question of the sin-eater has come up in \\n‘N. & Q.,’ and Mr. Owen has alluded in your issue \\nof 8 Feb. to my letter to the Times in September \\nlast, I should be glad of an opportunity of making \\na few remarks on the subject. I should have pre- \\nferred to do so in the Academy, but the editor, \\nafter inserting Mr. Hartland’s letters, in which I \\nwas alluded to by name half a dozen times and \\nchallenged to explain various facts, published Mr. \\nOwen’s reply without a word of explanation to \\nmyself. \\n\\nThe original purpose of my letter to the Times \\nwas to dispute the evidence for the Llandebie case, \\nand it was only incidentally that the general ques- \\ntion of sin-eating was involved. \\n\\nThe main objection to the Llandebie story is the \\nevidence of the schoolmaster Rowlands, who states \\nthat cakes were not given at funerals there. If \\nthis is so it is difficult to see how the sin-eater \\ncould have existed; for it is argued that this \\ncustom of giving cakes was a survival of sin-eating, \\nand we are asked to believe that the custom of \\ngiving cakes disappeared before the central figure, \\nthe sin-eater. \\n\\nThe weakness of Mr. Moggridge’s ipse dixit is so \\napparent that I need not enlarge on it ; for, in the \\nabsence of any statement of how he came by his \\ninformation, a story on his authority is worth no \\nmore than a statement in an anonymous letter, \\ncopied and published without investigation. \\n\\nI could not, even without the explicit denials \\nwhich we have before us, attach any importance \\nto such a story ; but when capable men, resident \\nin the neighbourhood, not only fail to find the sin- \\neater, but vouch for facts actually inconsistent \\nwith the existence of the sin-eater at the spot \\nwithin recent times, it seems absurd to consider \\nthe Llandebie case as coming under the head of \\nfacts for folk-lorists. \\n\\nIt is singular that no one has ever been \\nduced who has seen a sin-eater, or even spoken \\nwith any one who has seen one. If the sin-eater was \\nin existence in 1852 or shortly before, it should be \\npossible now (much more should it have been so in \\n1877) to produce one who could give testimony of \\nthis nature. N. W. Tomas. \\nNew College, Eastbourne. \\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Owen begins his remarks by saying that \\n‘ there appeared in the Times of 18 Sept., 1895, a \\nvery interesting letter from Mr. N. W. Thomas, of \\nOswestry, on the above subject.” He forgets to \\nsay that Mr. Thomas's letter was an attack on Mr. \\nHartland, to which the latter, inthe Times and the \\nAcademy, effectually replied. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE. B, Barry. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hartland quoted a passage from my ‘ House- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n170 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNOTES AND QUERIES. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[8 8, IX, Fen, 29, '96. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhold Tales and Traditional Remains,’ p. 124 ; and \\nas this has a material bearing on the subject, I \\nwill repeat it here :— \\n“When you drink wine at a funeral every drop that \\nou drink is s sin which the deceased has committed. \\nou thereby take away the dead man’s sins and bear \\nthem yourself.” \\n\\n\\nI can produce the informant from whom this \\ncurious piece of folk-lore was obtained. It was \\noffered to me without any questioning when I was \\ncollecting folk-lore some years ago, and it is un- \\ndoubtedly genuine. It completes what Aubrey \\nsaid about sin-eating; so that English folk-lore is \\nacquainted not only with sin-eating but also with \\nsin-drinking. It matters not whether such terms \\nas “ sin-eating ” or “‘sin-drinking” can be proved \\nto have existed in recent times. It is enough to \\nshow that the customs themselves existed ; and of \\nthis we have ample evidence. \\n\\nTaking the two customs together, one cannot \\nhelp seeing a resemblance between them and the \\nmissa pro defunctis, or mass for the dead. For \\nwhat is a ‘‘ mass” for the dead but a ‘‘ mess” or \\nbanquet for the dead? Prof. Skeat tells us that \\nthe Low Lat. missa “is usually accounted for by \\nsupposing that the allusion is to the words ite, missa \\nest.” Bat this seems far-fetched and very impro- \\nbable ; indeed, Prof. Skeat admits that the change \\nof vowel from the Lat. ¢ to O.E. «@, as in meesse, \\nM.E. messe, is remarkable. It is easy to trace the \\n** mess,” or feast for the dead, in ancient custom. \\nWe may see it in the mass of All Hallows, or All \\nHallows Day (1 Nov.), of which, even to this day, \\na reminiscence is found in Yorkshire in the \\n“tharf cakes” eaten during the first week of \\nNovember. We may see it in the funeral cakes so \\ncommonly eaten during the present century. We \\nmay see it in the enormous feasts and in the mighty \\nbrewings of ale held and made after the death of \\nthe wealthy in the Middle-English period. And, \\ngoing still further back, we may see it in the \\n\\nken bones, with marrow extracted, scattered \\nthroughout so many prehistoric burial mounds in \\nEngland.* From evidence thus presented it ap- \\npeared to Dr. Thurnam that anthropophagism once \\nprevailed in the British Isles, and he adduced some \\nes from ancient writers in support of his \\nopinion.t These were: Diodorus Siculus, v. 32; \\nStrabo, iv. 5, 4; Plinius, vii. 2; Hieronymus adv. \\nJovianun, ii. \\n\\nIf the explanation of “‘ mass” here offered be \\ncorrect, it follows that every “feast” in the calendar \\nis a commemorative banquet. The words of the \\nSaviour, ‘‘ This doin remembrance of me,” may be \\ncompared, and also the minni, or memorial cup, at \\nold northern sacrificer. S. O. Addy.\"]"
